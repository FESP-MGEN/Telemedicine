	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A health economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the program "Telemedicine for the Heart," which the German Foundation for the Chronically Ill organizes for the Techniker Krankenkasse, one of the biggest German statutory health insurance funds. The program consists of nurse-calls to motivate patients to perform regular self-measurements (blood pressure, pulse, weight) with either their own or telemedical measuring devices provided by the program. In the case of measured values outside of set limits, calls to treating physicians were placed to allow for the initiation of therapy adjustments where applicable.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate the program, a retrospective matched-pairs analysis was performed. Program participants (n=281) and regularly insured patients (n=843) were matched for demographics and morbidity status and compared according to their use of resources.
RESULTS: Significant cost differences in favor of the study group of up to 25\% in relation to total costs could be detected, particularly in the group of New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification II patients (persons with mild symptoms and slight limitation according to the NYHA classification for the extent of heart failure). In the more severe NYHA stages III and IV the cost relation differed and showed a slight cost disadvantage for the program group. Mortality was 35.1\% lower in the program group than in the control group. Quality of life measures were almost constant over the observation time, compatible with a positive impact of the program on the highly impaired patient group.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that, besides a reduction of costs, by participating in "Telemedicine for the Heart" patients with chronic heart failure experienced a reduced number of hospital stays, optimized medical therapy, better quality of life, and reduced mortality.},

METHODS: We donated multiheaded teaching microscopes equipped with digital cameras to four hospitals in Eastern Africa and trained local pathologists on their use. Static images of challenging cases were posted on a web-based telepathology platform. A U.S.-based pathologist reviewed images in consultation with subspecialist colleagues.
RESULTS: Over a period of 40 months, 109 cases were submitted for second opinion consultation, including 29 dermatopathology cases (26.6\%), 14 hematopathology cases (12.8\%), and 13 cases each (11.9\%) in cytopathology and bone and soft tissue pathology. Static images enabled a complete or partial diagnosis in 100/109 cases (91.7\%). Factors precluding a definitive diagnosis included absence of confirmatory immunophenotyping, technical issues, or lack of clinical history. Case responses included a diagnosis and discussion, including differential diagnosis, references, and treatment recommendations.
CONCLUSION: Static digital telepathology is a simple, cost-effective, reliable and efficient means to provide diagnostic and educational support to pathologists in the developing world. Additional training may help overcome technical factors precluding a definitive diagnosis in certain cases.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a specialist telemedicine intervention for improving diabetes care using the chronic care model (CCM).
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: As part of the CCM, 97 primary care physicians at 6 primary care practices in Rochester, MN, referred 639 patients to an on-site diabetes educator between July 1, 2001, and December 31, 2003. On first referral, physicians were centrally randomized to receive a telemedicine intervention (specialty advice and evidence-based messages regarding medication management for cardiovascular risk) or no intervention, keeping outcome assessors and data analysts blinded to group assignment. After each subsequent clinical encounter, endocrinologists reviewed an abstract from the patient's electronic medical record and provided management recommendations and supporting evidence to intervention physicians via e-mail. Control physicians received e-mail with periodic generic information about cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetes. Outcome measures included diabetes care processes (diabetes test completion), outcomes (metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, estimated coronary artery disease risk), and patient costs (payer perspective).
RESULTS: During the intervention, 951 (70\%) of the 1361 endocrinology reviews detected performance gaps and resulted in a message; primary care physicians reported using 49\% of messages in patient care. With a mean of 21 months' follow-up, the intervention, compared with control, did not significantly enhance metabolic outcomes or reduce estimated risk of coronary artery disease (adjusted mean difference, -1\%; 95\% confidence interval, -19\% to 17\%). The intervention group incurred lower costs (P=.02) but not in diabetes-related costs.
CONCLUSION: Specialty telemedicine did not significantly enhance the value of CCM in primary care.},

Rural communities additionally have increased disparities related to access barriers and a large minority population with poorer overall health. Research evidence supports telemedicine as an effective alternative to bring preventive diabetes care to remote areas. This article presents an overview of the leadership role of advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) with the implementation and evaluation of a pediatric diabetes telemedicine program at a rural pediatric outpatient specialty clinic in partnership with a tertiary center telemedicine network. The telemedicine program quality improvement (QI) project explored caregiver satisfaction with a convenience sample of caregivers (N = 14) using a nine-item Telemedicine Diabetes Caregiver Satisfaction Survey (TDCSS), with responses ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. Findings indicate caregivers were highly satisfied with communication/ privacy (M = 4.8), access to care (M = 4.1), and quality of services (M = 5.0). The multidisciplinary collaborative teamwork, continuous QI, and dependable technology were integral to the quality of the telemedicine clinical initiative. APRNs provided technology expertise, interdisciplinary collaboration leadership, care coordination, and advocacy for policy changes. Results demonstrate that telemedicine and APRN leadership can help implement innovative programs into rural communities to improve access to care, healthcare cost, and outcomes.},

	abstract = {Home telehealth can improve clinical outcomes for conditions that are common among patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, little is known about the costs and potential savings associated with its use. We developed clinical scenarios that describe common situations in treatment or prevention of pressure ulcers. We calculated the cost implications of using telehealth for each scenario and under a range of reasonable assumptions. Data were gathered primarily from US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative records. For each scenario and treatment method, we multiplied probabilities, frequencies, and costs to determine the expected cost over the entire treatment period. We generated low-, medium-, and high-cost estimates based on reasonable ranges of costs and probabilities. Telehealth care was less expensive than standard care when low-cost technology was used but often more expensive when high-cost, interactive devices were installed in the patient's home. Increased utilization of telehealth technology (particularly among rural veterans with SCI) could reduce the incidence of stage III and stage IV ulcers, thereby improving veterans' health and quality of care without increasing costs. Future prospective studies of our present scenarios using patients with various healthcare challenges are recommended.},

We assessed 3 low-cost telemedicine solutions capable of supporting remote US training to determine feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. We also explored the value of instructional videos immediately before telementoring.
METHODS: Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned to receive US mentoring in 1 of 3 telemedicine conditions: multiple fixed cameras, a smartphone, and traditional audio with a live US stream. Participants were then asked to perform a standardized US examination of the right upper quadrant under remote guidance. We measured observer's global ratings of performance along with the mentor's and student's rating of effort and satisfaction to determine which of the 3 approaches was most feasible, acceptable, and effective. During the second phase, students were randomized to watch an instructional video or not before receiving remote coaching on how to complete a subxiphoid cardiac examination. Effort, satisfaction, and performance from the independent observer's and student's perspective were surveyed.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the different telemedicine setups from the observer's perspective; however, the mentor rated the smartphone significantly worse (P = .028-.04) than other technologies. Platforms were rated equivalent from the student's perspective. No benefit was detected for watching an instructional video before the mentored task.
CONCLUSIONS: Remote US skills can be taught equally effectively by using a variety of telemedicine technologies. Smartphones represent a viable option for US training in resource-challenged settings.},

Integration of this technology into healthcare applications has begun to occur rapidly, making validation of the LMC׳s data output an important research goal. Here, we perform a detailed evaluation of the kinematic data output from the LMC, and validate this output against gold-standard, markered motion capture technology. We instructed subjects to perform three clinically-relevant wrist (flexion/extension, radial/ulnar deviation) and forearm (pronation/supination) movements. The movements were simultaneously tracked using both the LMC and a marker-based motion capture system from Motion Analysis Corporation (MAC). Adjusting for known inconsistencies in the LMC sampling frequency, we compared simultaneously acquired LMC and MAC data by performing Pearson׳s correlation (r) and root mean square error (RMSE). Wrist flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation showed good overall agreement (r=0.95; RMSE=11.6°, and r=0.92; RMSE=12.4°, respectively) with the MAC system. However, when tracking forearm pronation/supination, there were serious inconsistencies in reported joint angles (r=0.79; RMSE=38.4°). Hand posture significantly influenced the quality of wrist deviation (P{\textless}0.005) and forearm supination/pronation (P{\textless}0.001), but not wrist flexion/extension (P=0.29). We conclude that the LMC is capable of providing data that are clinically meaningful for wrist flexion/extension, and perhaps wrist deviation. It cannot yet return clinically meaningful data for measuring forearm pronation/supination. Future studies should continue to validate the LMC as updated versions of their software are developed.},

In the USA, fee-for-service model of healthcare delivery, services rendered are valued based upon time, intensity, and technical or practice expense costs. As a consequence of this perspective, and to contain spending, Medicare has grouped physician services into families. Spending within each family of services must, by law, remain budget neutral. Cardiac implantable electronic devices monitoring services, remote and in-person, are grouped into one family. As the volume of services within this family increases, the individual encounters are destined to be discounted into ever decreasing portions. However, if the value of remote monitoring is demonstrated to extend beyond the previous boundaries of in-person interrogations, a rational request can be made to reconsider the relative value of remote monitoring. Outcome data supporting the value-added benefits of remote monitoring are rapidly accumulating, including (i) patient convenience, with reduced use of office services, (ii) equal safety compared with in-person evaluation, (iii) shorter detection time to actionable events (arrhythmias, cardiovascular disease progression, and device malfunction), (iv) reduced length of stay for hospitalizations, (v) reduced inappropriate shocks, (vi) increased battery longevity, and (vii) a relative reduction in the risk of death. Fully automatic wireless technology, only recently widely implemented, will add considerable clinical efficiencies and further increase the value of remote monitoring. The U.S. challenge will be to appropriately define the relative value of CIEDs remote monitoring now that outcome data have demonstrated its value extends beyond in-person interrogation.},

	abstract = {The Affordable Care Act calls for using population-level incentive-based interventions, and cigarette smoking is one of the most significant health behaviors driving costs and adverse health in low-income populations. Telehealth offers an opportunity to facilitate delivery of evidence-based smoking cessation services as well as incentive-based interventions to low-income populations. However, research is needed on effective strategies for linking smokers to services, how to couple financial incentives with telehealth, and on how to scale this to population-level practice. The current paper evaluates primary implementation and follow-up results of two strategies for connecting low-income, predominantly female smokers to a telephone tobacco quitline (QL). The population-based program consisted of participant-initiated phone contact and two recruitment strategies: (1) direct mail (DM) and (2) opportunistic telephone referrals with connection (ORC). Both strategies offered financial incentives for being connected to the QL, and all QL connections were made by trained patient navigators through a central call center. QL connections occurred for 97\% of DM callers (N=870) and 33\% of ORC callers (N=4550). Self-reported continuous smoking abstinence (i.e., 30 smoke-free days at seven-month follow-up) was 20\% for the DM group and 16\% for ORC. These differences between intervention groups remained in ordered logistic regressions adjusting for smoking history and demographic characteristics. Each recruitment strategy had distinct advantages; both successfully connected low-income smokers to cessation services and encouraged quit attempts and continuous smoking abstinence. Future research and population-based programs can utilize financial incentives and both recruitment strategies, building on their relative strengths.},

Current evidence for these technologies gives some indication of what is required before health technologies can benefit patients. Rapidly changing health technologies make it difficult for community services to make fully informed decisions when implementing them. There are challenges in predicting the full financial and efficiency impacts, in making robust estimates of costs and workload implications and in anticipating the effects on patient care and staff experience. Despite these problems, there is mounting evidence of the benefits of technological innovations available to community nurses and their patients.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Skype is a peer to peer software application that has been historically used for voice and video calls, instant messaging, and file transfer over the Internet. Few studies are available using Skype specifically for telepathology.
AIMS: Our aim is to show that dynamic nonrobotic teleconsultation is possible and even effective via means of a standard microscope camera capable of live acquisition, Skype, an established broad band internet connection, and experienced pathologists.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Both the consulting "sending" pathologist and consultant "receiving" pathologist are reasonably experienced general surgical pathologists at junior attending level with several years of experience in sign out. Forty-five cases were chosen encompassing a broad range of surgical pathology specimens. The cases were prospectively evaluated with the consultant diagnosis used as a preliminary pathologic impression with the final diagnosis being confirmation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Versions of Skype 5.0 and above were used along with established broadband internet connections, usually between academic medical institutions.
RESULTS: Forty of forty-five cases (89\%) were essentially concordant. In four of forty-five cases (9\%), the consulting impression gave a differential, but favored an entity which did not match the final diagnosis. Only one case (2\%) did the consulting impression not match the final diagnosis; a discordant opinion.
CONCLUSIONS: The image quality via Skype screen sharing option is excellent. Essentially no lag time was seen. We have shown in our small pilot study that Skype is an effective cost-efficient means for teleconsultation, particularly in the setting of entity-related differential diagnoses in surgical pathology and when both the consulting and consultant pathologists are reasonably experienced.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The first satellite center to offer interventional radiology procedures at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center opened in October 2014. Two of the procedures offered, fine needle aspirations and core biopsies, required rapid on-site cytologic evaluation of smears and biopsy touch imprints for cellular content and adequacy. The volume and frequency of such evaluations did not justify hiring on-site cytotechnologists, and therefore, a dynamic robotic telecytology (TC) solution was created. In this technical article, we present a detailed description of our implementation of robotic TC.
METHODS: Pathology devised the remote robotic TC solution after acknowledging that it would not be cost effective to staff cytotechnologists on-site at the satellite location. Sakura VisionTek was selected as our robotic TC solution. In addition to configuration of the dynamic robotic TC solution, pathology realized integrating the technology solution into operations would require a multidisciplinary effort and reevaluation of existing staffing and workflows.
RESULTS: Extensively described are the architectural framework and multidisciplinary process re-design, created to navigate the constraints of our technical, cultural, and organizational environment. Also reviewed are the benefits and challenges associated with available desktop sharing solutions, particularly accounting for information security concerns.
CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic robotic TC is effective for immediate evaluations performed without on-site cytotechnology staff. Our goal is providing an extensive perspective of the implementation process, particularly technical, cultural, and operational constraints. Through this perspective, our template can serve as an extensible blueprint for other centers interested in implementing robotic TC without on-site cytotechnologists.},

Remote care of paediatric patients by offsite specialists using telemedicine technology is a highly potential solution for coping up with the shortage of specialists in Indian subcontinent. We at a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India assessed the application of telemedicine services for diagnosis and management of paediatric illnesses, through prospective analyses of electronic databases over 4 years. The age groups covered were from newborn up to children of 15 years of age. The outcomes assessed were: feasibility, diagnostic possibilities, management, outcomes, referral and mean costs per patient. The results were as follows: major consultations involved children {\textless}5 years age, with neonates contributing to 5.5\% of the total consultations. The major system-related problems were: gastrointestinal, respiratory, neurological, infectious and haematological. Referral was advised in 14.3\% of cases. Ten percent of children were critically ill and could not have been in a position to be transported safely. Videoconferencing was done in 21.4\% patients. There was a paucity of feedback and follow up of these consultations (12\% of the total). The total savings for all the consultations per child was ≈1000 Indian rupees (approximately US\$22) leaving behind the telemedicine consultation charges. To conclude, telepaediatrics in India is still in its fetal stage. The hurdles and medico-legal issues need to be addressed before the telepaediatrics service is widely accepted in India.},

We leverage this artificial society to simulate and analyze population dynamics using Korean population census data. The agents in this model derive their decisional behaviors from real data (microsimulation feature) and interact among themselves (agent-based modeling feature) to proceed in the simulation. The behaviors, interactions, and social scenarios of the agents are varied to perform an analysis of population dynamics. We also estimate the future cost of pension policies based on the future population structure of the artificial society. The proposed framework and model demonstrates how ALife techniques can be used by researchers in relation to social issues and policies.},

This is due to its simple and energy-efficient data reduction procedure, which makes it suitable for resource-constrained wireless body area network (WBAN)-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) telemonitoring applications. Both spatial and temporal correlations exist simultaneously in multi-channel ECG (MECG) signals. Exploitation of both types of correlations is very important in CS-based ECG telemonitoring systems for better performance. However, most of the existing CS-based works exploit either of the correlations, which results in a suboptimal performance. In this work, within a CS framework, the authors propose to exploit both types of correlations simultaneously using a sparse Bayesian learning-based approach. A spatiotemporal sparse model is employed for joint compression/reconstruction of MECG signals. Discrete wavelets transform domain block sparsity of MECG signals is exploited for simultaneous reconstruction of all the channels. Performance evaluations using Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt MECG diagnostic database show a significant gain in the diagnostic reconstruction quality of the MECG signals compared with the state-of-the art techniques at reduced number of measurements. Low measurement requirement may lead to significant savings in the energy-cost of the existing CS-based WBAN systems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Technology-based lifestyle behavioral interventions (i.e., telehealth, mHealth, eHealth, and/or digital health) are becoming an alternative standard of care and possess several advantages over traditional clinical settings such as convenience, cost, and the ability to tailor plans and feedback to a participant's individual needs. These technology-based interventions also present unique challenges to intervention fidelity due to extra elements involved in executing the intervention. Intervention fidelity monitoring is essential to ensure internal and external validity, yet the development and utilization of fidelity protocols is under-reported in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to describe the intervention fidelity protocol for the 24-START study, a behavior change intervention delivered through telephone and internet. This paper also discusses the results of a pilot audit conducted to determine the feasibility of monitoring adherence to the fidelity protocol.
METHODS: The 24-START fidelity protocol was developed in accordance with the five fidelity areas outlined by the NIH Behavior Change Consortium (NIH BCC) including: design of study, provider training, delivery of treatment, receipt of treatment, and enactment of treatment. The fidelity strategies provided by the NIH BCC in each area were tailored to fit the specific design of the 24-START study. Twenty-six total fidelity strategies were developed in accordance with the five areas and a corresponding fidelity monitoring plan was created. Because these strategies are only beneficial if implemented, the fidelity monitoring plan was developed to ensure the fidelity strategies are consistently implemented over the course of the intervention.
RESULTS: A pilot audit of nine participant files was conducted to test the feasibility of the fidelity protocol developed. Out of the nine participant files reviewed, 89\% of scheduled phone calls between a telehealth coach and participant were successfully completed. Of the completed calls, telehealth coaches delivered the intervention as intended 85.3\% of the time, and 74\% of planned secondary contacts made through the internet were delivered successfully. Additionally, between treatment group dosing was found to be equal. Several weak areas in the fidelity protocol were identified for improvement. The results were satisfactory and the audit was deemed feasible for ongoing use.
CONCLUSIONS: The NIH BCC provides a valuable framework for telehealth interventions to develop fidelity protocols ultimately contributing to improved internal and external validity, better translation of results, increased transparency, and increased opportunities for replication within the field. The 24-START pilot audit found the fidelity protocol efficacious and feasible while also identifying areas of weakness in need of revision. The refined protocol will continue to be utilized throughout the data collection phase. Future telehealth interventions should develop and disclose fidelity protocols to improve the overall quality and standard of telehealth interventions.},

This study explores real-life compliance and health services impacts of mood monitoring among patients with bipolar disorder in the UK.
METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder who were registered users of the True Colours monitoring system for at least 12months at study assessment were included in this retrospective cohort study (n=79). Compliance was measured as the proportion of valid depression and mania scale messages received in comparison to their expected numbers over the first 12months of monitoring. Mental health service use data were extracted from case notes, costed using national unit costs, and compared 12months before (pre-TC period) and 12months after (TC period) patients' engagement with monitoring. Associations with relevant patient factors were investigated in a multiple regression model.
RESULTS: Average compliance with monitoring was 82\%. Significant increases in the annual use and costs of psychiatrist contacts and total mental health services were shown for patients newly referred to the clinic during the pre-TC period but not for long-term patients of the clinic. Psychiatric medication costs increased significantly between the pre-TC and TC periods (£235, P=0.005) unrelated to patients' referral status.
CONCLUSIONS: Remote mood monitoring has good compliance among consenting patients with bipolar disorder. We found no associations between observed changes in mental health service costs and the introduction of monitoring except for the increase in psychiatric medication costs.},

Based on these advantages, some Brazilian Universities have used these actions in strategies of education, research and extension, aiming at the application of Tele-health in Brazil. In that way, the Bauru School of Dentistry - University of São Paulo (FOB-USP) has applied the use of information and communication technologies in health by means of a "Tele-Health League" (TL), in order to diagnose, prevent and treat diseases, in addition to educate the population and health services.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to introduce the characteristics of the Tele-Health League of FOB-USP, as well as the development of its projects.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Tele-Health League consisted as a Diffusion Course approved by the Provost of Culture and Academic Extension of the University of São Paulo. It is composed as a large group enclosing professoriate coordinator, academician principal, contributing professors and league members, those, diversified between undergraduates students, graduated, health employees, technology and information areas. The participant members are evaluated by the presence frequency (minimum of 85\%), and by the performance of tests and paperwork about the theoretical content provided.
RESULTS: In four years of activities, the TLFOB-USP obtained a high satisfaction index (90\%), an increased number of vacancies due to the interest to become a member, more commitment of the professors of the University and the accomplishment of association with other Brazilian leagues. It is emphasized that the approval percentage of the course results in approval from approximately half of its members. Also, it is important to identify and repair the causes related to the quitting of some members.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the TLFOB-USP members, adjoining to the professor's participants, develop projects in Tele-helth, in Tele-aid and Tele-education areas, thus resulting in the involvement of the University and the community.},

Telemonitoring systems for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) seem to be a promising tool for reducing workload and costs, and they have the potential of optimizing patient care. However, issues such as practical functionality of ICD telemonitoring in daily routine may affect its broad implementation. The objective of this study was to evaluate potential problems during the implementation of a telemonitoring system, Medtronic CareLink™ (CL™) with respect to the installation and data transmission process. A total of 159 patients with ICDs who were equipped with the CL™ system were evaluated and followed up for 16 months regarding the success rate of the first data transmission via the telemonitoring system. In this cohort, a high rate of nontransmission of 23.9 \% was observed after the 16-month follow-up. A detailed interview of these patients (no transmission) revealed that the main reasons for failed transmissions were due to the patients' loss of interest in the concept (approximately 50 \%) as well as technical problems (approximately 25 \%) with setting up the system. These results indicate that telemonitoring systems bear potential problems and that the evaluation of patient motivation and technical support options seems to play an important role in establishing the functionality of these systems.},

The aim of this study is to document the experience and opinion of the patient and clinician satisfaction with telehealth encounter for various pediatric surgical consultations and follow-up as a way to bridge the distance gap.
METHODS: We observe our experience with recent telehealth implementation from 2008 to 2009. Qualitative data were collected through questionnaires aimed at patients and clinicians.
RESULTS: There were 259 pediatric surgical telehealth encounters, of which 37\% were from outside the province. There were 42 antenatal multidisciplinary, 13 chronic pain, 103 general surgery, 2 orthopedic, 63 urology, 33 head and shape nurse practioner clinic, and 3 neurosurgery consults. 83 patient and 12 clinician questionnaires were completed. 97\% of patients and 73\% of clinicians reported satisfaction with having a telehealth session. 97\% of the patients reside more than 200 km from the city and 77\% live more than 400 km away. 48\% reported a cost saving {\textgreater}\$500-\$700.
CONCLUSION: Telehealth for pediatric surgical services is an alternative as an acceptable, effective, and appropriate way to consult and follow-up pediatric patients who live in significantly remote areas with great clinician and patient satisfaction.},

However, it is not clear whether second opinion seeking should be promoted or discouraged and how second opinion services and policies can be better formalized to maximize the benefits and minimize the disadvantages.
METHODS: A nationwide survey was conducted with a representative sample of 678 physicians involved in cancer care (75.5\% participation rate) recruited in 13 cancer centres.
RESULTS: Most physicians involved with cancer care perceived patients' second opinion seeking as a legitimate right (96.0\%) and they acknowledged the need for second opinion services under certain conditions (98.2\%). Many believed that second opinions can enhance patient satisfaction (77.3\%) and quality of care (74.3\%), but they also had concerns about increase in healthcare and societal costs (91.3\%) and concentration in a high-volume centre (90.7\%). While the majority agreed with the involvement of the first opinion physicians in the second opinion services (69.5\%), there were mixed opinions regarding the desirability of remote (teleconsultation) second opinion services (49.0\%) and coverage by national health insurance (51.9\%).
CONCLUSION: Physicians were generally positive to second opinion services and expected positive consequences in terms of patient satisfaction and quality of care. However, they had concerns about the consequences regarding cost and equity, and disagreements were observed regarding the way to improve second opinion services. The physicians' opinions revealed in our study will be helpful in developing clearer guidelines used to maximize the benefits of second opinion services.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We established a new system, taking advantage of two advanced technologies, the digital video transport system (DVTS) and the research and education network (REN), which enabled satisfactory telemedicine on a routine basis.
RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2013, we organized 360 programs connecting 221 hospitals or facilities in 34 countries in Asia and beyond. The two main areas were endoscopy and surgery, with 113 (31\%) and 106 (29\%) events, respectively. Teleconferences made up 76\% of the total events, with the remaining 24\% being live demonstrations. Multiple connections were more popular (63\%) than one-to-one connections (37\%). With continuous technological development, new high-definition H.323 and Vidyo(®) (Hackensack, NJ) systems were used in 47\% and 39\% of events in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The evaluation by questionnaires was favorable on image and sound quality as well as programs.

The purpose of using telehealth for overseas organ transplantation (OOT) was debated. This study aimed to explore the dilemma in applying telehealth for OOT patients from the perspectives of health professionals and e-health information and communication technologists (eh-ICTs) in Taiwan.
METHODS: An exploratory qualitative method was used, with a purposive sample of OT health professionals (OTHP) and eh-ICTs in Taiwan. Qualitative data were collected by face-to-face semistructured interviews, and were analyzed by content analysis.
RESULTS: Fifty subjects including 10 OT surgeons (OTS), 30 registered nurses (RNs), and 10 eh-ICTs participated in this study. Five dilemmas were identified: (1) medical law violation (80\%, n = 40 of 50; 100\% OTS [n = 10 of 10], 67\% RNs [n = 20 of 30], 100\% eh-ICTs [n = 10 of 10]); (2) integrating telecommunication and medical systems for OOT (74\%, n = 37 of 50; 90\% OTS [n = 9 of 10], 73\% RNs [n = 22 of 30], 60\% eh-ICTs [n = 6 of 10]); (3) the inconsistent caring protocols among medical parties (68\%, n = 34 of 50; 80\% OTS [n = 8 of 10], 70\% RNs [n = 21 of 30], 50\% eh-ICTs [n = 5 of 10]); (4) the uncertainty in quality of care in overseas medical institutes (62\%, n = 31 of 50; 80\% OTS [n = 8 of 10], 60\% RNs [n = 18 of 30], 50\% eh-ICTs [n = 5 of 10]); and (5) the uncertainty in cost-effectiveness (36\%, n = 18 of 50; 60\% OTS [n = 6 of 10], 17\% RNs [n = 5 of 30], 70\% eh-ICTs [n = 7 of 10]).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of telehealth for OOT is in its infancy. A systematic curriculum with advanced pilots targeted to develop telehealth for OOT will be needed for mutual communication between OTHPs and eh-ICTs in the near future.},

Traditionally, the government has subsidised the expenses of delivering affordable healthcare to underserved communities. Because of the many recent advances in telecommunications technology, telemedicine has gained increasing attention. Teleradiology, in particular, is by far the maturest of all telemedicine disciplines and, thus, it may serve as a pivotal indicator of whether telemedicine on a global scale is feasible or not.

The broad reach of mobile technologies and changing digital lifestyles provide unique opportunities for using remote monitoring and self-care tools to reinforce preventive oral hygiene behaviours. By leveraging big data analytics and insights gleaned from the use of sensor-enabled oral care devices, providers will be able to engage patients more effectively and deliver timely, personalized behavioural nudges to support optimal oral health. Dental insurers and payers will need to reinvent their business models to incentivize dental providers and patients who embrace the digital-dentistry paradigm. This could involve increasing reimbursements for mHealth-delivered preventive dental services and holding individuals accountable for behaviours that put them at higher risk for dental disease.

Methods: A retrospective review of TM visits of male prisoners from 2007 to 2014 was performed. Effectiveness of TM visits was assessed by 1) concordance of TM and in-person diagnoses, 2) compliance with radiologic and medication orders and 3) in-person visits saved with TM. Safety was assessed by analyzing the number of patients in which an ED visit was required after TM visit and missed or delayed cases of malignancy. Estimates were then made of the number of patients that could safely be managed with TM alone.
Results: The most common diagnosis was voiding dysfunction (24\%) followed by genitourinary pain (23\%). Diagnoses were concordant in 90\% of patients; compliance was high (radiology 91\%, medications 89\%); in-person visits were estimated to be saved in 80-94\%. No men required peri-TM ED visits and no cases of malignancy were missed in the population that returned for an in-person visit. We estimated that over 50\% of urologic complaints in this cohort could have been managed with TM alone.
Conclusions: TM was shown to be a safe and effective method to provide general urologic care that obviated the initial in-person visits in nearly 90\% of patients. It is likely that TM could safely replace in-person visits for many urologic conditions, especially in younger men and those in which access to specialized care may be limited.},

METHODS: Our sample included 107 hospitals located in NC. Our analytic dataset included variables from the American Hospital Association (AHA) annual survey, AHA Health IT supplement, Healthcare Cost Report Information System, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER online database. We supplemented our secondary sources with data on telestroke adoption and market-level variables developed for NC. We used the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and previous telehealth studies to guide selection of variables. We conducted a multivariate logistic regression to determine associations with telestroke adoption.
RESULTS: Proportion of discharges that are Medicare (odds ratio [OR] = 1.93, P {\textless} .04) and total operating margin (OR = 2.89, P = .00) were positively associated with telestroke adoption. Critical access hospital status was positively associated with telestroke adoption, although not at P {\textless} .05 (OR = 5.61, P = .07). Distance to the nearest hospital with a telestroke program (OR = .91, P = .01) and volume of emergency department visits (OR = .98, P {\textless} .05) were both negatively associated with telestroke adoption.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is novel in its focus on telestroke adoption and use of variables not included in previous telehealth analyses. Our findings suggest some hospitals have neither the financial resources nor the ability to pool resources for acquiring needed technology, and differences in adoption may result in geographic inequities in access to telestroke services.},

	abstract = {Introduction: There is increasing interest in technologies that may enable remote monitoring of respiratory disease. Traditional methods for assessing respiratory function such as spirometry can be expensive and require specialist training to perform and interpret. Remote, non-contact tracking of chest wall movement has been explored in the past using structured light, accelerometers and impedance pneumography, but these have often been costly and clinical utility remains to be defined. We present data from a 3-Dimensional time-of-flight camera (found in gaming consoles) used to estimate chest volume during routine spirometry maneuvres. Methods: Patients were recruited from a general respiratory physiology laboratory. Spirometry was performed according to international standards using an unmodified spirometer. A Microsoft Kinect V2 time-of-flight depth sensor was used to reconstruct 3-dimensional models of the subject's thorax to estimate volume-time and flow-time curves following the introduction of a scaling factor to transform measurements to volume estimates. The Bland-Altman method was used to assess agreement of model estimation with simultaneous recordings from the spirometer. Patient characteristics were used to assess predictors of error using regression analysis and to further explore the scaling factors. Results: The chest volume change estimated by the Kinect camera during spirometry tracked respiratory rate accurately and estimated forced vital capacity (FVC) and vital capacity to within ± {\textless}1\%. Forced expiratory volume estimation did not demonstrate acceptable limits of agreement, with 61.9\% of readings showing {\textgreater}150 ml difference. Linear regression including age, gender, height, weight, and pack years of smoking explained 37.0\% of the variance in the scaling factor for volume estimation. This technique had a positive predictive value of 0.833 to detect obstructive spirometry. Conclusion: These data illustrate the potential of 3D time-of-flight cameras to remotely monitor respiratory rate. This is not a replacement for conventional spirometry and needs further refinement. Further algorithms are being developed to allow its independence from spirometry. Benefits include simplicity of set-up, no specialist training, and cost. This technique warrants further refinement and validation in larger cohorts.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Telemedicine is a major effort to tackle the uneven availability of facilities for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke. We present a telestroke model introduced in a small hilly state of Himachal Pradesh in India.
AIMS: To provide acute ischemic stroke treatment with tissue plasminogen activator in all district hospitals of Himachal Pradesh with computerized axial tomographic scan facility through Telemedicine.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Smartphone-based hub and spoke telestroke model was used with two tertiary care hospitals (with neurologists) as hub and 17 district hospitals (without onsite neurologists) as spokes.
SUBJECT AND METHODS: The telestroke project was launched in the state of Himachal Pradesh in April 2014. Medical officers in district hospitals (Medicine graduates and Internal Medicine postgraduates) were trained in the treatment of stroke through workshops. Tissue plasminogen activator was made available at all these centers, free of cost through hospital pharmacies. Four neurologists at two tertiary care centers were made available for consultation on phone.
RESULTS: Between June 2014 and May 2015, a total of 26 patients received thrombolysis under the telestroke project at nine district hospitals without onsite presence of a neurologist. Eight patients were females and 18 males. The age of patients ranged from 26 to 80 years. Only 2 patients developed an intracranial bleed following thrombolysis, and both were nonfatal.
CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-based telestroke services may be a much cheaper alternative to video-conferencing-based telestroke services and are more portable with less technical glitches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first telestroke model being reported from India. It seems to be the way forward in providing timely treatment in acute ischemic stroke in underserved and resource poor settings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Text messaging (short message service, SMS) is a widely accessible and potentially cost-effective medium for encouraging behavior change. Few studies have examined text messaging interventions to influence child health behaviors or explored parental perceptions of mobile technologies to support behavior change among children.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine parental acceptability and preferences for text messaging to support pediatric obesity-related behavior change.
METHODS: We conducted focus groups and follow-up interviews with parents of overweight and obese children, aged 6-12 years, seen for "well-child" care in eastern Massachusetts. A professional moderator used a semistructured discussion guide and sample text messages to catalyze group discussions. Seven participants then received 3 weeks of text messages before a follow-up one-on-one telephone interview. All focus groups and interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Using a framework analysis approach, we systematically coded and analyzed group and interview data to identify salient and convergent themes.
RESULTS: We reached thematic saturation after five focus groups and seven follow-up interviews with a total of 31 parents of diverse race/ethnicity and education levels. Parents were generally enthusiastic about receiving text messages to support healthy behaviors for their children and preferred them to paper or email communication because they are brief and difficult to ignore. Participants anticipated high responsiveness to messaging endorsed by their child's doctor and indicated they would appreciate messages 2-3 times/week or more as long as content remains relevant. Suggestions for maintaining message relevance included providing specific strategies for implementation and personalizing information. Most felt the negative features of text messaging (eg, limited message size) could be overcome by providing links within messages to other media including email or websites.
CONCLUSIONS: Text messaging is a promising medium for supporting pediatric obesity-related behavior change. Parent perspectives could assist in the design of text-based interventions.

Methods A randomised controlled 12-month trial of 42 patients with severe COPD was conducted. Home TM of oximetry, temperature, pulse, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, spirometry, and weight with telephone support and home visits was tested against a control group receiving only identical telephone support and home visits. Results The results suggest that TM had a reduction in COPD-related admissions, emergency department presentations, and hospital bed days. TM also seemed to increase the interval between COPD-related exacerbations requiring a hospital visit and prolonged the time to the first admission. The interval between hospital visits was significantly different between the study arms, while the other findings did not reach significance and only suggest a trend. There was a reduction in hospital admission costs. TM was adopted well by most patients and eventually, also by the nursing staff, though it did not seem to change patients' psychological well-being. Discussion Ability to draw firm conclusions is limited due to the small sample size. However the trends of reducing hospital visits warrant a larger study of a similar design. When designing such a trial, one should consider the potential impact of the high quality of care already made available to this patient cohort.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Five billion people worldwide do not have timely access to surgical care. Cinterandes is one of the only mobile surgical units in low- and middle-income countries. This paper examines the methodology that Cinterandes uses to deliver mobile surgery.
METHODS: Founding and core staff were interviewed, four missions were participated in, and internal documents and records were analysed between 1 May and 1 July 2014.
RESULTS: Cinterandes performed 7641 operations over the last 20 years (60\% gastrointestinal/laparoscopic), travelling 300,000 km to remote areas of Ecuador. The mobile surgery programme was initiated by a local Ecuadorian surgeon in 1980. Funding was acquired from businesses, private hospitals, and individuals, to fund a low-cost surgical truck, simple equipment, and running costs. The mobile surgical unit is a 24-foot modified Isuzu truck containing a preparation room with general equipment storage and running water, together with an operating room including the operating table, anaesthetic and surgical equipment. Mission structure includes: patient identification by a network of local medical personnel in remote regions; pre-operative assessment at 1 week by core team via teleconsultations; four-day surgical missions; post-operative recovery in tents or a local clinic; post-operative follow-up care by local personnel and remote teleconsultations. The permanent core team includes seven members; lead surgeon, lead anaesthetist, operating-room technician, medical coordinator, driver, general coordinator, and receptionist. Additional support members include seven regular surgeons, residents, medical students, and volunteers.
CONCLUSION: Surgery is a very effective way to gain the trust of the community, due to immediate results. Trust opens doors to other programmes (e.g. family medicine). Surgery can be incorporated with all other aspects of health care, which can in turn be incorporated with all other aspects of human development, education, food production and nutrition, housing, work and productivity, communication, and recreation.},

Continuous respiratory monitoring could be a powerful tool in managing chronic diseases, however it is infrequently performed because of obtrusiveness and inconvenience of the existing methods.

This paper presents human testing results of a light-weight (30 g), wearable respiratory effort energy harvesting sensor. The harvester output voltage, power, and its metabolic burden, are measured on twenty subjects in two resting and exercise conditions each lasting 5 min. The system includes two off-the-shelf miniature electromagnetic generators harvesting and sensing thoracic and abdominal movements. Modules can be placed in series to increase the output voltage for rectification purposes. Electromagnetic respiratory effort harvester/sensor system can produce up to 1.4 V, 6.44 mW, and harvests 30.4 mJ during a 5-min exercise stage. A statistical paired t-test analysis of the calculated EE confirmed there is no significant change ( P {\textgreater} 0.05 ) in the metabolic rate of subjects wearing the electromagnetic harvester and biosensor.},

The CellScope iPhone Otoscope is a device that may be used for tele-otoscopy and it enables parents to record their children's ear examinations and send the films for remote physician diagnosis. This study aims to determine the ability to diagnose, and the reliability of the diagnosis when utilizing video exams obtained by a parent versus video exams obtained by an otolaryngologist.
METHODS: Parents of children ages 17 years or younger attempted recordings of the tympanic membrane of their children with the CellScope after a video tutorial; a physician subsequently used the device to record the same ear. Recordings occurred prior to standard pediatric otolaryngology office evaluation. Later, a remote pediatric otolaryngologist attempted diagnosis solely based on the videos, blinded to whether the examination was filmed by a parent or physician. Interrater reliability between video diagnosis and original diagnosis on pneumatic otoscopy was measured, and objective tympanic membrane landmarks visualized on the films were recorded.
RESULTS: Eighty ears were enrolled and recorded. There was low interrater agreement (k = 0.42) between diagnosis based on parent videos as compared with pneumatic otoscopy. There was high agreement (k = 0.71) between diagnosis based on physician videos and pneumatic otoscopy. Physician videos and parent videos had only slight agreement on objective landmarks identified (k = 0.087).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Each year, the United States spends over \$4 billion on emergency department visits for evaluation of dizziness. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common cause of dizziness that can easily be diagnosed by observing characteristic eye movements during the Dix-Hallpike test (DHT). The DHT is easily performed; however, interpretation requires more advanced training. This may be part of the reason it is not commonly performed in emergency departments, and instead, patients undergo costly imaging tests. We evaluated whether smartphone-based video recordings of DHT could be assessed telemedically for screening of nonacute dizziness.
STUDY DESIGN: Feasibility study.
METHODS: Dizzy patients underwent objective vestibular testing, but also had videos of their eye movements recorded via a smartphone during the DHT. The videos were remotely reviewed by two neuro-otologists for BPPV screening and were compared to objective and in-person exam findings.
RESULTS: Overall, 30 dizzy patients were evaluated with seven cases of BPPV. The sensitivity for diagnosing BPPV via a smartphone-recording of eye movements of the DHT was 92.86\%, with a specificity of 100\% and a negative predictive value of 97.87\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our initial proof-of-concept study shows that remote screening of BPPV is possible with high specificity. Because the DHT is easily taught, having a remote otolaryngologist interpret the resulting eye movements may increase usage of the test and may lead to cost savings.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Screening for cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMVR) is important in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and low CD4(+) counts. However, many human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients lack access to specialist ophthalmological care. Telemedicine screening is a cost-effective method for screening these patients. We aimed to report the use of composite nine-field digital fundus photography (DFP) images for CMVR screening. We report its sensitivity and specificity in detecting CMVR and the level of agreement with gold-standard binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An audit was performed on our national CMVR screening program that screened all HIV patients referred to the Ophthalmology Department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. All patients underwent retinal screening with DFP. Images were categorized as CMVR-positive, CMVR-negative, suspicious, or unreadable by blinded retinal specialists. Patients subsequently underwent dilated gold-standard indirect ophthalmoscopy by a different retinal specialist. Diagnoses were categorized as CMVR-positive, CMVR-negative, or unreadable. Sensitivity and specificity of retinal findings on DFP and kappa values for level of agreement between the two screening methods were calculated.
RESULTS: Three hundred seventy screenings on 188 patients were performed. Twenty-three eyes diagnosed with CMVR on indirect ophthalmoscopy were also identified on DFP (100\% sensitivity). A 99.9\% specificity was achieved. The fundus photograph of one eye without CMVR was read as CMVR-positive because of an artifact, accounting for a false-positive. Kappa values ranged from 0.739 to 0.987.
CONCLUSIONS: DFP is a sensitive and specific method of screening HIV patients for CMVR and has a high level of agreement with indirect ophthalmoscopy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Secondary prevention by risk factor modification improves patient outcomes, yet it is often not achieved in clinical practice. Reasons for failure stem from challenges of prioritizing risk factor reduction and engaging patients in changing their behaviors. We hypothesize that a novel telemedicine intervention with tailored patient education could improve cardiovascular risk factors.
METHODS: To evaluate this intervention, we propose enrolling 450 patients with a recent myocardial infarction and hypertension into a 3-arm randomized, controlled trial. The first arm (n=150) will receive home blood pressure (BP) monitors plus a nurse-delivered, telephone-based tailored patient education intervention and will be enrolled into HealthVault, a Microsoft electronic health record platform. The second arm (n=150) will also receive BP monitors plus a tailored patient education intervention and be enrolled in HeartVault. However, the patient education intervention will be delivered by a Web-based program and will cover topics identical to those in the nurse-delivered intervention. Both arms will be compared with a control group receiving standard care (n=150). All participants will have an in-person assessment at baseline and at completion of the study, including standardized measurements of BP, LDL cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin (in diabetic subjects). The study design will allow assessment of a telephone-based, nurse-administered disease management program versus standard care. The main outcome of interest is the reduction in systolic BP in each intervention group compared with the control group at 12 months. Secondary outcomes assessed will include reductions in LDL cholesterol, body weight, and glycosylated hemoglobin, as well as adherence to evidence-based therapies and improvement in health behaviors.
CONCLUSION: If successful in optimizing BP control, managing other coronary heart disease risk factors, and demonstrating a lower cost, the Web-based disease management tool has the potential to enhance coronary artery disease management, quality of care, and ultimately, patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Accessing health services in isolated populations where human resources and infrastructure are constrained by vast geographical landmasses poses challenges and opportunities for nurses, health care providers, patients and families.
DESIGN: A qualitative approach was adopted with a purposeful sample of 10 patients and four family members representative of nine communities.
METHOD: Selection criteria included patients receiving telehealth visits for a minimum of a year and willing to share their experiences. Data were collected during the winter of 2006 using semi-structured video taped interviews and analysed using a qualitative thematic content analysis.
RESULTS: Patients and families experiences of their telehealth visits centered on three key themes: lessening the burden (costs of travel, accommodations, lost wages, lost time and physical limitations), maximising supports (access to family, friends, familiar home environment, nurses and other care providers), tailoring specific e-health systems to enhance patient and family needs.
CONCLUSION: The benefits of telehealth extend not only to patients and families but are linked to benefits for providers as well as the health care system.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study indicates that video telehealth is an effective mechanism for delivering nursing and other health services to rural/remote communities and can impact positively on the quality of health care. The integration of telehealth practice can enhance the coordination, organisation and implementation of health care services.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: measuring cognitive function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) can be challenging given the obstacles faced when traveling to testing centers.
OBJECTIVE: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of remote cognitive assessment in patients with MS using the automated neuropsychological assessment metrics (ANAM-MS) and the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT).
METHODS: patients meeting the McDonald criteria for MS (n = 24) were randomized to complete the live-in-office condition or a remote-in-office condition first, with all patients completing both sessions. Patients (n = 20) then completed a final remote-in-home testing session. Both remote sessions were proctored by a psychologist using a secure telehealth connection.
RESULTS: scores on the live SDMT differed from scores in the two remote settings F(2, 38) = 4.46, p = 0.018. However, summary scores on the ANAM-MS were similar across the three settings, F(2, 36) = 2.21, p = 0.124. Satisfaction with telehealth testing was high on the part of the examiner and patients. Each telehealth testing session saved more than \$144.00 in travel costs and lost wages.
CONCLUSION: this study demonstrated that valid results can be obtained when evaluating patients remotely using ANAM-MS. Some differences were noted for the SDMT that suggest that either specific norms or a different implementation approach may be needed for telehealth.},

	volume = {14},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.1912},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous trials of heart failure telemonitoring systems have produced inconsistent findings, largely due to diverse interventions and study designs.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are (1) to provide in-depth insight into the effects of telemonitoring on self-care and clinical management, and (2) to determine the features that enable successful heart failure telemonitoring.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 heart failure patients attending a heart function clinic who had used a mobile phone-based telemonitoring system for 6 months. The telemonitoring system required the patients to take daily weight and blood pressure readings, weekly single-lead ECGs, and to answer daily symptom questions on a mobile phone. Instructions were sent to the patient's mobile phone based on their physiological values. Alerts were also sent to a cardiologist's mobile phone, as required. All clinicians involved in the study were also interviewed post-trial (N = 5). The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and then analyzed using a conventional content analysis approach.
RESULTS: The telemonitoring system improved patient self-care by instructing the patients in real-time how to appropriately modify their lifestyle behaviors. Patients felt more aware of their heart failure condition, less anxiety, and more empowered. Many were willing to partially fund the use of the system. The clinicians were able to manage their patients' heart failure conditions more effectively, because they had physiological data reported to them frequently to help in their decision-making (eg, for medication titration) and were alerted at the earliest sign of decompensation. Essential characteristics of the telemonitoring system that contributed to improved heart failure management included immediate self-care and clinical feedback (ie, teachable moments), how the system was easy and quick to use, and how the patients and clinicians perceived tangible benefits from telemonitoring. Some clinical concerns included ongoing costs of the telemonitoring system and increased clinical workload. A few patients did not want to be watched long-term while some were concerned they might become dependent on the system.
CONCLUSIONS: The success of a telemonitoring system is highly dependent on its features and design. The essential system characteristics identified in this study should be considered when developing telemonitoring solutions.},

Recent Findings: The Global Burden of Disease project has shown that skin diseases continue to be the 4th leading cause of nonfatal disease burden world-wide. However, research efforts and funding do not match with the relative disability of skin diseases. International and national efforts, such as the WHO List of Essential Medicines, are critical towards reducing the socioeconomic burden of skin diseases and increasing access to care. Recent innovations such as teledermatology, point-of-care diagnostic tools, and task-shifting help to provide dermatological care to underserved regions in a cost-effective manner.
Summary: Skin diseases cause significant non-fatal disability worldwide, especially in resource-poor regions. Greater impetus to study the burden of skin disease in low resource settings and policy efforts towards delivering high quality care are essential in improving the burden of skin diseases.},

The core of the platform is a dashboard, which is accessible through a browser window. Integrated with the dashboard are a blood pressure meter, a weight scale and a web-based patient questionnaire. The ePoint.telemed platform is a fully automatic internet based system meant for early warning in a CHF rehabilitation program. Unlike traditional remote medical technologies (RMT) building on dedicated medical equipment, we are applying easy-to-use personal health system (PHS) components geared towards the wellness and sports market. A Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) has been started using the platform. 50 patients will be involved in the study with the aim of finding out if the home telemonitoring of CHF is clinically effective in Northern Norway and if it is cost-effective.},

The data from the robotic arm were tracked for understanding the time efficiency of the human interactions at the master stations. Comparison of a beginner in ultrasound operation with a professional sonographer revealed that although proficiency in using ultrasound was not a prerequisite for operating the robotic arm, previous experience in using clinical ultrasound was associated with progressively lower probe maneuvering time and speed due to an enhanced ability of the veteran operator in adjusting the finer angular motions of the probe. These results suggest that long-distance telerobotic echocardiography over a local nondedicated Internet bandwidth is feasible and can be rapidly learned by sonographers for cost-effective resource utilization.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The advancements in telemedicine provide the possibility to send photos of hematuria cases to professionals for further evaluation. We aimed to evaluate the inter-rater reliability of WhatsApp use in the evaluation of hematuria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2014 and April 2016, 212 patients were evaluated prospectively for hematuria by 2 groups of urologists; Group A: in direct contact with patients for evaluation; Group B: "blind" urologist who had no access to the patients' data but received pictures via WhatsApp. Two photos of voided urine in a sterile container were taken and sent using WhatsApp. The opinions of Group A and B about the grade of hematuria were evaluated. Shapiro-Wilk test and Fleiss' kappa statistics were used for statistical analyses.
RESULTS: The median age of patients was 71 (min 22, max 96). The Group A urologists were in accordance in 96.22\% of cases. Group B urologists had common opinions in 99.5\% (n = 203) and there was almost perfect agreement between 2 groups (λ = 0.992). The number of common opinions among "blind" urologists is more than the number of common opinions among the consultants. When further classification is performed as serious and non-serious hematuria, the rate of misdiagnosing serious cases is approximately 6.5-7\%. However, using WhatsApp, the urologists can differentiate normal urine and any form of hematuria with 100\% accuracy.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to evaluate hematuria remotely and also reduce unnecessary costs of services for hematuria of mild clinical significance by using telemedicine. WhatsApp can provide valuable aid to tertiary hospitals where the urologist is not always present as well as in rural areas.},

Specifically, we introduce spectral demultiplexing approaches that aim to digitally narrow the spectral content of broadband illumination sources (such as wide-band light emitting diodes or even sunlight) to improve spatial resolution in holographic on-chip microscopy. We also demonstrate the application of such spectral demultiplexing approaches for wide-field imaging of multicolor fluorescent objects on a chip. These computational approaches can be used to replace e.g., thin-film interference filters, gratings or other optical components used for spectral multiplexing/demultiplexing, which can form a desirable solution for cost-effective and compact wide-field microscopy and sensing needs on a chip.},

This leads to a situation when patients are not supported by healthcare professionals in the interpretation of test results. Interpretation of test results is a resource-consuming task that will delay the results and increase costs of each test. However, this can be done by computer-based decision support systems that have proved to solve such tasks efficiently. So, the design and implementation of a decision support system that would generate reports for the patients who referred to a test center without a doctor's referral can increase motivation and support patients to make better informed decisions. The goal of this study is to implement a decision support system for patients. We developed a clinical decision support system for the patients that solves a classification problem by relating a vector of test results to a set of diagnoses and find a set of recommendations associated with every diagnosis from this set.},

The availability of rigorous and valid evidence-based cost studies emerged as a major challenge to the field. Existing cost studies provided evidence that telehomecare may be a promising application area for TR. Cost studies also indicated that telepsychiatry is a promising telepractice area.

METHODS: All institutionalised psychiatric patients at the Institute of Mental Health with follow-up appointments at the National Skin Centre were assessed for eligibility and invited to participate. Recruited patients were first seen by a dermatologist via videoconferencing, and then by another dermatologist in person, within 1 week. Clinical outcome measures were then assessed by a third independent dermatologist. The following outcome measures were assessed for each paired patient visit: inter-physician clinical assessment, diagnosis, management plan, adverse events and total patient turnaround time (PTAT) for each consultation.
RESULTS: There were a total of 13 patients (mean age, 64.6 years; range 44-80) with 27 patient visits. All were male patients with chronic schizophrenia. The predominant skin condition was chronic eczema and its variants (62\%), followed by cutaneous amyloidosis (23\%) and psoriasis (15\%). The level of complete and partial agreement between the teledermatology and face-to-face consultation was 100\% for history-taking and physical examination and 96\% for the investigations, diagnosis, management plan and the treatment prescribed. The PTAT for teledermatology was 23 min, compared to 240 min for face-to-face consultations. No adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSION: Teledermatology was as effective as face-to-face consultation and reduced the PTAT by 90\%, resulting in increased patient convenience, operational efficiency and reduced manpower need. Our study supports the safe and cost-effective use of teledermatology for the follow-up of chronic skin conditions in psychiatric patients.},

This study draws on central goals laid out in the ACA - to decrease costs, increase access, and improve patient outcomes. The use of the Patient-Centered Medical Homes (PCMHs) is a care model that has the potential to meet all three goals. How to identify the most effective way to develop PCMHs in the specific context of Hawai'i is the focus of this study. To provide recommendations for effective PCMH formation, a qualitative review of previously compiled data from the Hawai'i/Pacific Basin Area Health Education Center (AHEC) and phone interviews with six primary care providers throughout the islands were conducted. The results broadly suggest three paths towards the effective implementation of PCMHs in Hawai'i. The first recommendation is to create a PCMH template or business model for physicians in order to ease the complexities of implementing such an elaborate system of care. The second two recommendations actually veer away from PCMH towards general interventions to increase care in rural Hawai'i. Thus, the second recommendation is to create a specific track for becoming a rural practitioner at the John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) to increase the retention of physicians in underserved areas. And the final recommendation is to increase utilization of telemedicine techniques to overcome physician shortages and geographic challenges by allowing rural physicians to network with specialists on neighbor islands. These three strategies are all possible to accomplish with commitment and could be implemented to benefit the providers and rural population of Hawai'i.},

How do we know that these investments and the foregone opportunity costs are the correct ones? Absent, poor, or vague eHealth strategy is a significant barrier to effective investment in, and implementation of, sustainable eHealth solutions and establishment of an eHealth favorable policy environment. Strategy is the driving force, the first essential ingredient, that can place countries in charge of their own eHealth destiny and inform them of the policy necessary to achieve it. In the last 2 years, there has been renewed interest in eHealth strategy from the World Health Organization (WHO), International Telecommunications Union (ITU), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the African Union, and the Commonwealth; yet overall, the literature lacks clear guidance to inform countries why and how to develop their own complementary but locally specific eHealth strategy. To address this gap, this paper further develops an eHealth Strategy Development Framework, basing it upon a conceptual framework and relevant theories of strategy and complex system analysis available from the literature. We present here the rationale, theories, and final eHealth strategy development framework by which a systematic and methodical approach can be applied by institutions, subnational regions, and countries to create holistic, needs- and evidence-based, and defensible eHealth strategy and to ensure wise investment in eHealth.},

Since the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), there has been intense pressure on hospitals and health systems to reduce costs. Many hospitals are responding by merging and buying doctors' practices, while some are beginning to offer their own health plans for the first time and setting up accountable care organizations that would provide coordinated high quality health care for large groups of patients. With new hospital mergers being announced weekly and more practices being added to hospital systems daily, the need to collaborate through virtual health initiatives is gaining strength. The addition of inexpensive secure telemedicine to the availability of an intelligent patient record form based on best practice guidelines will enable greater collaboration across the hospital system. This type of technology will increase revenues, cut costs, improve outcomes and increase patient and provider satisfaction.},

Telehealth is becoming an accepted way to improve patient access to specialist healthcare. Over 200,000 Australian's have hepatitis C virus (HCV) and new treatments are very effective and well tolerated. We aim to demonstrate that HCV treatment utilising telehealth support for care delivery has cure rates similar to onsite care in clinical trials. We also report length of consultation and calculate reductions in travel and carbon output. Methods Patient demographic, clinical, and treatment outcome data were collected prospectively from hospital software and analysed retrospectively. This was an audit of all patients treated for HCV in one year from a single tertiary hospital that included telehealth in their care delivery. Results Sustained virological response was achieved in 51/52 (98\%) patients with completed treatment courses, and 51/58 (88\%) of those who had a planned telehealth consultation as part of their management. A median of 634 km of patient travel was saved per telehealth consultation. Discussion We found that a telehealth-supported outreach programme for patients in regional Australia with HCV produced similar outcomes to clinical trials. There was a considerable saving in time and cost for the patients and significant environmental benefit through the reduction in carbon footprint associated with travel to distant specialist health services. We conclude that telehealth facilitated outreach is a feasible and effective way to access HCV treatment and cure in regional Australia.},

One of the most important applications is the continuous remote monitoring of vital parameters. Long-term monitoring of biopotentials requires skin-electrodes. State-of-the-art electrodes such as Ag/AgCl wet electrodes lead, especially during long-term application, to complications, e.g., skin irritations. This paper presents a low-cost, on-demand electrode approach for future long-term applications. The fully printed module comprises a polymeric substrate with electrodes on a flexible membrane, which establishes skin contact only for short time in case of measurement. The membranes that produce airtight seals for pressure chambers can be pneumatically dilated and pressed onto the skin to ensure good contact, and subsequently retracted. The dilatation depends on the pressure and membrane thickness, which has been tested up to 150 kPa. The electrodes were fabricated in screen and inkjet printing technology, and compared during exemplary electrodermal activity measurement (EDA). The results show less amplitude compared to conventional EDA electrodes but similar behavior. Because of the manufacturing process the module enables high individuality for future applications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As a direct result of the population growing older the total number of chronic illnesses increases. The future expenditure for care of chronically ill patients is an ever-present challenge for the health care system. New solutions based on integrated care or the inclusion of telemedical systems in the treatment procedure can be essential for reducing the future financial burden. Therefore a detailed economic model was developed, which enables the comparison of health and cost outcomes for conventional medical care and different integrated care concepts in heart failure treatment.
METHODS: F0r modelling, the discrete event technique was used. The model takes outpatient care as well as inpatient care into account to estimate the total occurring costs. It enables the treatment of patients by a physician, a specialist or a clinical ambulance for the simulation of the outpatient care. For inpatient care the model considers the total-costs of the hospitalization and rate of re-admission and furthermore the costs which occur because of special medical treatments or necessary stay at intensive care units. To rate the severity of symptoms patients can be classified using NYHA groups. To outline some of the potential model results, two scenarios have been simulated to compare both methods of care regarding overall costs.
RESULTS: The developed simulation model allows comparing health and cost outcomes of different integrated care concepts for the treatment of heart failure patients. Additionally to the simulation of standard outpatient and inpatient care procedures in Austria the approach of a telemedical monitoring system for heart failure patients was implemented in this economic model. With the simulated scenarios it could be shown that under the given simulation parameters the telemedical system can lead to cost savings of up to 8\% within the first three years.
CONCLUSIONS: The developed model represents a comprehensive tool, which opens a wide field of possible simulation scenarios for the treatment of heart failure patients with special focus on overall cost estimations and reimbursement strategies. The simulated scenarios show that telemedical care has the potential of improved health outcomes and economic benefits.},

Adapting spatial interfaces to these new platforms can open up exciting application areas for VR. In this case, the application area was in-home VR therapy for patients suffering from persistent pain (for example, arthritis and cancer pain). For such therapy to be successful, a rich spatial interface and rich visual aesthetic are particularly important. So, an interdisciplinary team with expertise in technology, design, meditation, and the psychology of pain collaborated to iteratively develop and evaluate several prototype systems.

Here, we describe a technique allowing determination of renal function based on transcutaneously measured elimination kinetics of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-sinistrin, the FITC-labeled active pharmaceutical ingredient of a commercially available marker of GFR. A low cost device transcutaneously excites FITC-sinistrin at 480  nm and detects the emitted light through the skin at 520  nm. A radio-frequency transmission allows remote monitoring and real-time analysis of FITC-sinistrin excretion as a marker of renal function. Due to miniaturization, the whole device fits on the back of freely moving rats, and requires neither blood sampling nor laboratory assays. As proof of principle, comparative measurements of transcutaneous and plasma elimination kinetics of FITC-sinistrin were compared in freely moving healthy rats, rats showing reduced kidney function due to unilateral nephrectomy and PKD/Mhm rats with cystic kidney disease. Results show highly comparable elimination half-lives and GFR values in all animal groups. Bland-Altman analysis of enzymatically compared with transcutaneously measured GFR found a mean difference (bias) of 0.01 and a -0.30 to 0.33 ml/min per 100 g body weight with 95\% limit of agreement. Thus, with this device, renal function can be reliably measured in freely moving rats eliminating the need for and influence of anesthesia on renal function.},

A recently approved implantable wireless pulmonary artery pressure remote monitor, the CardioMEMS HF System, has been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalizations among New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III HF patients. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of this remote monitoring technology compared to standard of care treatment for HF. A Markov cohort model relying on the CHAMPION (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Class III Heart Failure Patients) clinical trial for mortality and hospitalization data, published sources for cost data, and a mix of CHAMPION data and published sources for utility data, was developed. The model compares outcomes over 5 years for implanted vs standard of care patients, allowing patients to accrue costs and utilities while they remain alive. Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty in input parameters. The CardioMEMS HF System was found to be cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \$44,832 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity analysis found the model was sensitive to the device cost and to whether mortality benefits were sustained, although there were no scenarios in which the cost/QALY exceeded \$100,000. Compared with standard of care, the CardioMEMS HF System was cost-effective when leveraging trial data to populate the model.},

We investigate whether text messaging by use of short message service (SMS) of EKGs from a small hospital to consultants at a large hospital is rapid and accurate.
METHODS: This study involved a one-month prospective evaluation of consecutive EKGs recorded in a small community ED. Investigators obtained de-identified photographs of each EKG via a mobile phone camera. Each EKG picture, along with a brief patient clinical history, was sent via SMS to on-call emergency physicians located at a large referral care site. All images were evaluated solely on a mobile phone. The primary outcome was the proportion of SMS that were received within two minutes of being sent. As a secondary outcome, the intra-rater evaluation of the initial EKG and the SMS EKG image were compared on 13 standardized features. The tertiary outcome was cost of text messaging.
RESULTS: A total of 298 patients (14.6\%) had 409 EKGs performed and a total of 926 SMS were sent. 921 SMS (99.5\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 98.7-99.8\%) arrived within two minutes with a median transmission time of nine seconds (interquartile range (IQR) 3-32 s). Between the gold standard original EKG, and the interpretation of the texted image, six out of 409 (1.5\%, 95\% CI 0.6-3.3\%) had any differences recorded, across all 13 categories. Overall, the study cost 4.1 cents per texted image.
CONCLUSIONS: Systematic text messaging of ED EKGs from a small community hospital to a referral center is a rapid, accurate, portable, and inexpensive method of data transfer. This may be a safe and effective strategy to communicate vital patient information.},

To develop the technical environment for easy data mining and data exchange in different countries in Europe.
METHODS: Existing clinical and IT-based projects for documentation of medical data in general medicine and ophthalmology were analyzed to create new data sets for medical documentation in glaucoma patients. Different types of data transfer methods were evaluated to find the best method of data exchange between ophthalmologists in different European countries.
RESULTS: Data sets from existing IT projects showed a wide variability in specifications, use of codes, terms and graphical data (perimetry, optic nerve analysis etc.) in glaucoma patients. New standardized digital datasets for glaucoma patients were defined, based on existing standards, which can be used by general ophthalmologists for follow-up examinations and for glaucoma specialists to perform teleconsultation, also across country borders. Datasets are available in different languages. Different types of data exchange methods using secure medical data transfer by internet, USB stick and smartcard were tested for different countries with regard to legal acceptance, practicability and technical realization (e.g. compatibility with EMR systems).
CONCLUSION: By creating new standardized glaucoma specific cross-national datasets, it is now possible to develop an electronic glaucoma patient record system for data storage and transfer based on internet, smartcard or USB stick. The digital data can be used for referrals and for teleconsultation of glaucoma specialists in order to optimize glaucoma treatment. This should lead to an increase of quality in glaucoma care, and prevent expenses in health care costs by unnecessary repeated examinations.},

One hundred and thirty-five general practitioners from Lombardy, Molise, and Valle d'Aosta were enrolled. An ad hoc questionnaire was used to evaluate the feasibility, approval, efficacy, and satisfaction of telemedicine among the general practitioners. Ninety-three general practitioners used the telemedicine consultation (responders) for a total of 1,396 calls (1,264 for cardiology, 65 for dermatology, 32 for diabetology, 22 for rheumatology, and 13 for pneumology). In cardiology, telemedicine was used to address all problems without further action in 733 cases (61\%). Ninety-eight percent of responders indicate satisfaction with telemedicine. The cost of telemedicine in our study was estimated to be 25.36 Euros/contact. In conclusion, the SUMMA Project demonstrated for the first time clinically the effectiveness of second-opinion consultation by general practitioners and therefore fulfilling the actual needs in areas usually managed by the National Health System.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a rural emergency telepsychiatry program, the Mental Health Emergency Care-Rural Access Program (MHEC-RAP), which aims to improve access to emergency mental health care for communities throughout western New South Wales (NSW).
METHODS: A descriptive analysis of service activity data from the introduction of the MHEC-RAP in 2008 to 2011 using Chi-squared tests and linear regression modelling to assess change and trends over time.
RESULT: There were 55959 calls to the MHEC-RAP, 9678 (17\%) of these calls initiated an MHEC-RAP service ({\textasciitilde}2500 each year). The use of video assessment increased over 18 months, then levelled off to an average of 65 each month. Health care provider use increased from 54\% to 75\% of all contacts, and 49\% of MHEC-RAP patients were triaged 'urgent'. Most (71\%) were referred from the MHEC-RAP for outpatient care with a local provider. The proportion of MHEC-RAP patients admitted to hospital initially increased by 12\%, then declined over the next 2 years by 7\% (by 28\% for admissions to a mental health inpatient unit (MHIPU)).
CONCLUSION: The MHEC-RAP is well established. It has achieved acceptable levels of service activity and continues to be as used as intended. Further research is required to confirm how the MHEC-RAP works in terms of process and capacity, how it has changed access to mental health care and to document its costs and benefits. WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE TOPIC? Rural and remote communities have poorer access to and use of mental health services. Telehealth care is a reliable and accepted means for providing non-urgent mental health care. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD? The MHEC-RAP is a practical and transferable solution to providing specialist emergency mental health care, and support for local providers, in rural and remote areas via telehealth. There is a possible impact upon the problem of recruiting and retaining a mental health workforce in rural and remote areas. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS? Providing reliable remote access to specialist mental health assessment and advice while supporting providers in rural communities can result in better outcomes for patients and services alike.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Outcomes for premature and critically ill neonates are improved with care provided by neonatologists in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). For smaller hospitals, maintaining the personnel and equipment necessary for the delivery and care of unexpectedly high-risk neonates is a significant challenge. To address this disparity in access, telemedicine has been increasingly used to support providers, patients, and their families in community newborn nurseries and NICUs. The purpose of this review is to present the current state of the use of telemedicine by regional NICUs to support community newborn nurseries, NICUs, and families.
METHODS: A literature review was conducted by two independent reviewers. Articles were selected for inclusion if they described the use of telemedicine with neonates or in the NICU. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the articles using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Study Quality Assessment Tools.
RESULTS: Fourteen articles were identified. After consensus discussion, eight of the articles were rated good and six were rated fair by the two reviewers. Many of the articles suggested improvements in quality of care, family satisfaction, and reductions in the cost of care. Unfortunately, a majority of the studies to date have had small sample sizes or were performed in a single institution and lacked robust evaluations of patient- and family-centered outcomes and provider decision making.
CONCLUSIONS: While these early studies are promising, more robust studies involving more patients and more institutions are needed to identify opportunities where telemedicine can impact health outcomes, patient-centeredness, or costs of care of neonates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The greatest burden from stroke-related disability is borne by Low-and-Middle Income countries (LMICs) where access to rehabilitation after stroke is severely challenged. Tele-rehabilitation could be a viable avenue to address unmet rehabilitation needs in LMICs.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the burden of post-stroke physical deficits, rates of utilization of physiotherapy services, and perceptions of tele-rehabilitation among recent Ghanaian stroke survivors.
METHODS: Using a consecutive sampling strategy, 100 stroke survivors attending an outpatient Neurology clinic in a Ghanaian tertiary medical center were enrolled into this cross-sectional study. After collecting basic demographic data, clinical history on stroke type, severity and level of disability, we administered the validated 20-item Functional Independence Measure questionnaire to evaluate functional status of study participants and an 8-item questionnaire to assess participants' attitudes towards telemedicine administered rehabilitation intervention.
RESULTS: Mean±SD age of study participants was 57.2±13.3years of which 51.0\% were males with a mean duration of stroke of 1.3±2.2years. 53\% had Modified Rankin scores of ≥3, 57\% were fully independent and only 27\% reported utilizing any physiotherapy services. Barriers to access to physiotherapy included financial constraints due to cost of physiotherapy services and transportation as well as premature discharge from physiotherapy to avoid overburdening of available physiotherapy services. These factors led to the limited provision of rehabilitative therapy. Participants held positive views of the potential for tele-rehabilitation interventions (80-93\%). However, while 85\% owned mobile phones, only 35\% had smart phones.
CONCLUSION: Despite, a high burden of residual disability, only about 1 out of 4 stroke patients in this Ghanaian cohort was exposed to post-stroke physiotherapy services, largely due to relatively high costs and limited health system resources. These Ghanaian stroke patients viewed the potential role of Tele-rehabilitation as positive, but this promising intervention needs to be formally tested for feasibility, efficacy and cost-effectiveness.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Increasing the energy expenditure above the elementary level of metabolism by undertaking regular physical activity causes body mass reduction and its maintenance at a healthy level.
AIM: To remote assessment of the level of physical activity in a group of overweight and obese individuals.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research was conducted in the Department of Rehabilitation at the Institute of Rural Health, Lublin, Poland, and included a group of 514 volunteers of both genders (38 ±12 years). The examined group was divided into three subgroups depending on the body mass index (BMI) level (I - normal, II - overweight, III - obese). The level of physical activity at home was assessed based of the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), conducted by means of a mobile application, and was compared with data registered by the accelerometer of a smartphone.
RESULTS: The IPAQ-assessed level of the physical activity expressed in MET-min/week amounted to the following values: group I: 5190.38 ±6629.84, group II: 5099.53 ±6380.97, group III: 3939.31 ±4000.73; and the caloric cost (cal × week-1) amounted to: group I: 5825.47 ±7512.99, group II: 7204.09 ±9187.96), and group III: 7002.10 ±7296.22. Registered levels of physical activity (MET-min/week) were lower than IPAQ-assessed: in group I (3741.24 ±3958.29), in group II (2447.72 ±2156.44) and in group III (1927.42 ±1790.85) (p {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The average values of energy expenditure showed a declining tendency, together with an increase in the BMI. On the other hand, the total weekly caloric cost showed the lowest average values in the group with normal body mass.},

As of 2011 after the United States, Italy together with Germany is the country with the largest number of active Robotic centers, 46, and da Vinci Robots installed, with at least 116 operators already trained. The number of interventions performed in Italy in 2011 exceeded 6,000 and in 2010 were 4,784, with prevalence for urology, general surgery and gynecology, however these interventions have also begun to be applied in other fields such as cervicofacial, cardiothoracic and pediatric surgery. In Italy Robotic centers are mostly located in Northern Italy, while in the South there are only a few centers, and four regions are lacking altogether. Of the 46 centers which were started in 1999, the vast majority is still operational and almost half handle over 200 cases a year. The quality of the work is also especially high with large diffusion of radical prostatectomy in urology and liver resection and colic in general surgery. The method is very well accepted among operators, over 80 \%, and among patients, over 95 \%. From the analysis of world literature and a survey carried out in Italy, Robotic surgery, which at the moment could be better defined as telesurgery, represents a significant advantage for operators and a consistent gain for the patient. However, it still has important limits such as high cost and non-structured training of operators.},

Thus, we developed an Internet-based telemedicine system to address the suboptimal control of hypertension and other modifiable risk factors. To minimize cost, the subjects used home monitors for blood pressure (BP) measurements and entered these values into the telemedicine system. We hypothesized that patients could accurately measure their BP and transmit these values via a telemedicine system. Inner city and rural subjects (N = 464; 42\% African-American or Hispanic) with 10\% or greater 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease and with treatable risk factors were randomized into two groups, control group (CG) and telemedicine group (TG). Each subject received a home sphygmomanometer with memory. The TG recorded and entered BP at least weekly. During office visits, the BP meters were downloaded and recorded BP compared to BP values transmitted via telemedicine. The telemedicine (T) BP values were similar to the meter recorded (R) values (T: systolic/diastolic BP 133.4 +/- 11.1/77.5 +/- 6.8 mm Hg, and R: systolic/diastolic BP 136.4 +/- 11.9.4/79.7 +/- 7.5 mm Hg). The percent error was {\textless}1\% for both systolic (-0.02 +/- 0.04\%) and diastolic (-0.03 +/- 0.04\%) BP. Lastly, the telemedicine BP values were similar to the office (O) BP values for systolic and diastolic BP (T: systolic/diastolic BP 133.4 +/- 11.1/77.5 +/- 6.8 mm Hg, and O: systolic/diastolic BP 136.3 +/- 20.5/78.1 +/- 10.5 mm Hg). In underserved populations, this inexpensive approach of patients using a home monitor and entering these values into a telemedicine system provided accurate BP data.},

	abstract = {ISSUES: There is a shortage of high-quality intervention-based evidence in the drug and alcohol misuse field. That is, evidence based on replicated effects using rigorous methodology, to establish a causal knowledge base around ethical, cost-effective methods relevant to clinical practice. The knowledge base in this field is limited participant recruitment challenges; difficulty generalizing results from single-centre studies; lack of research culture; issues in managing research teams; incentives for descriptive research; and limited expertise in research design and working in multidisciplinary teams.
APPROACH: An Australian national multicentre collaboration is proposed to overcome these barriers, and reduce the burden of drug and alcohol misuse by increasing the number of high-quality clinical trials in this field. It would involve: selecting a representative sample of centres nation-wide with expertise in specific drug and alcohol issues; creating an expert multidisciplinary team to facilitate clinical trials; simultaneous recruitment and implementation of clinical trials across centres; establishing a virtual infrastructure; forming an independent data-integrity and methodology review panel; and attracting and allocating funding for clinical trials.
IMPLICATIONS: The ability to allocate funding, the involvement of multidisciplinary experts in drug and alcohol research, and the establishment of infrastructure and procedures are likely to result in the national multicentre group's capacity to prescribe the type of research conducted under its auspices.
CONCLUSION: The proposed initiative is likely to increase the volume of high-quality clinical trials in the Australian drug and alcohol field, a key step towards reducing the burden of drug and alcohol misuse.},

The highest proportion of human and economic cost is associated with admissions for acute exacerbation of respiratory symptoms (AECOPD). Since prompt detection and treatment of exacerbations may improve outcomes, early detection of AECOPD is a critical issue. This pilot study was aimed to determine whether a mobile health system could enable early detection of AECOPD on a day-to-day basis. A novel electronic questionnaire for the early detection of COPD exacerbations was evaluated during a 6-months field trial in a group of 16 patients. Pattern recognition techniques were applied. A k-means clustering algorithm was trained and validated, and its accuracy in detecting AECOPD was assessed. Sensitivity and specificity were 74.6 and 89.7 \%, respectively, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.84. 31 out of 33 AECOPD were early identified with an average of 4.5 ± 2.1 days prior to the onset of the exacerbation that was considered the day of medical attendance. Based on the findings of this preliminary pilot study, the proposed electronic questionnaire and the applied methodology could help to early detect COPD exacerbations on a day-to-day basis and therefore could provide support to patients and physicians.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of digital pathology images has motivated the design of tools to foster multidisciplinary collaboration among researchers, pathologists, and computer scientists. Telepathology plays an important role in the development of collaborative tools, as it facilitates the transmission and access to pathology images by multiple users. However, the huge file size associated with pathology images usually prevents full exploitation of the collaborative telepathology system potential. Within this context, rate control (RC) is an important tool that allows meeting storage and bandwidth requirements by controlling the bit rate of the coded image. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based RC algorithm with lossless region of interest (RoI) coding for pathology images. The algorithm, which is designed for block-based predictive transform coding methods, compresses the non-RoI in a lossy manner according to a target bit rate and the RoI in a lossless manner. It employs a graph where each node represents a constituent block of the image to be coded. By incorporating information about the coding cost similarities of blocks into the graph, a graph kernel is used to distribute a target bit budget among the non-RoI blocks. In order to increase RC accuracy, the algorithm uses a rate-lambda (R- ) model to approximate the slope of the rate-distortion curve of the non-RoI, and a graph-based approach to guarantee that the target bit rate is accurately attained. The algorithm is implemented in the High-Efficiency Video Coding standard and tested over a wide range of pathology images with multiple RoIs. Evaluation results show that it outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods designed for single images by very accurately attaining the target bit rate of the non-RoI.},

We want to share some lessons learned in nearly two decades serving the poorest segments of the society, despite limited funding, through the use of communication and information technologies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data analyzed come from the accumulated experience in a remote rural center in southern Venezuela (La Milagrosa Health Center in Maniapure, Bolivar State) and further experience in over 20 similar rural clinics replicated from that case. The methodology has been a retrospective evaluation of results with a constantly maturing and dynamic practice at three levels of care: (1) remote (basic clinic), (2) a virtual triage center, and (3) a specialty level.
RESULTS: We analyzed qualitative results on access to specialty care of previously excluded communities (populations) and the significant cost reduction (social and financial) by avoiding unnecessary travel for the majority of consulting patients. In cases needing subspecialty care that require travel, the effectiveness of such activity is optimized in time and service.
CONCLUSIONS: Communication and information technologies can provide significant savings to society and improve healthcare with the use of common and relatively inexpensive consumer-level devices if used in a basic, coordinated system of services with adequate training and follow-up.},

Diabetiva offers telemedicine-based outpatient health care in combination with PDS generated by the Karlsburg Diabetes Management System, KADIS®. This retrospective analysis is based on data from the first year of running KADIS-based PDS in routine diabetes care. Participants were insured persons diagnosed with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. For final analysis, patients were grouped retrospectively as users or nonusers according to physician acceptance or not (based on questionnaires) of the KADIS-based PDS.
RESULTS: A total of 538 patients participated for more than one year in the Diabetiva program. Of these patients, 289 had complete data sets (two continuous glucose monitoring measurements, two or more hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values, and a signed questionnaire) and were included in the final data analysis. Of the physicians, 74\% accepted KADIS-based PDS, a rate that was clearly related to HbA1c at the beginning of the observation. If KADIS-based PDS was accepted, HbA1c decreased by 0.4\% (7.1\% to 6.7\%). In contrast, rejection of KADIS-based PDS resulted in an HbA1c increase of 0.5\% (6.8\% to 7.3\%). The insurance company revealed an annual cost reduction of about 900 € per participant in the Diabetiva program.
CONCLUSIONS: KADIS-based PDS in combination with telemedicine has high potential to improve the outcome of routine outpatient diabetes care.},

	abstract = {The authors have designed and developed a telemedicine-based service for the follow-up and monitoring of patients on oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) that consists of two phases; the first involving self-testing and the second involving guided self-management. To evaluate the first phase of the protocol, a project was conducted with 108 patients, with a mean age of 72.7 years and a mean treatment time at the start of the study of 55.2 months, divided into two groups: telemedicine and control (conventional procedure). The degree of anticoagulation control was similar in the two groups: individual in-range international normalized ratios (59.2\% vs 61.1\%; p = 0.55) and individual time within target range (65.7\% vs 66.4\%; p = 0.85) showed no significant differences. The incidence of adverse events--death (5.5\% vs 5.5\%; p = 1.0), major hemorrhagic complications (0\% vs 1.8\%; p = 1.0), minor hemorrhagic complications (7.4\% vs 3.7\%; p = 0.67), and thromboembolism (1.8\% vs 3.7\%; p = 1.0)--was also similar, with no significant differences. Acceptability of the change, measured in terms of quality of life (SF-12 and Sawicki questionnaires) and anxiety (state-trait anxiety inventory questionnaire) at the beginning and end of the study period was higher in the telemedicine group, with statistically significant improvements in mental component summary (3.6 vs -6.2; p = 0.02), dissatisfaction (-0.8 vs 0.2; p = 0.001), stress (-0.3 vs 0.05; p = 0.03), limitations (-0.2 vs 0.3; p = 0.005), social problems (-0.1 vs 0.3; p = 0.03), and state anxiety (-2.5 vs 2.3; p = 0.04). Parameters related to costs, such as the mean number per patient of office visits due to OAT (1.7 vs 13.8; p {\textless} 0.001) and other office visits (10.1 vs 11.5; p = 0.028), were also more favorable in the telemedicine group, as were additional parameters that enabled an exhaustive evaluation of the service.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a conceptual model for effective use of telehealth in the management of chronic health conditions, and to use this to develop and evaluate an intervention for people with two exemplar conditions: raised cardiovascular disease risk and depression.
DESIGN: The model was based on several strands of evidence: a metareview and realist synthesis of quantitative and qualitative evidence on telehealth for chronic conditions; a qualitative study of patients' and health professionals' experience of telehealth; a quantitative survey of patients' interest in using telehealth; and review of existing models of chronic condition management and evidence-based treatment guidelines. Based on these evidence strands, a model was developed and then refined at a stakeholder workshop. Then a telehealth intervention ('Healthlines') was designed by incorporating strategies to address each of the model components. The model also provided a framework for evaluation of this intervention within parallel randomised controlled trials in the two exemplar conditions, and the accompanying process evaluations and economic evaluations.
SETTING: Primary care.
RESULTS: The TElehealth in CHronic Disease (TECH) model proposes that attention to four components will offer interventions the best chance of success: (1) engagement of patients and health professionals, (2) effective chronic disease management (including subcomponents of self-management, optimisation of treatment, care coordination), (3) partnership between providers and (4) patient, social and health system context. Key intended outcomes are improved health, access to care, patient experience and cost-effective care.
CONCLUSIONS: A conceptual model has been developed based on multiple sources of evidence which articulates how telehealth may best provide benefits for patients with chronic health conditions. It can be used to structure the design and evaluation of telehealth programmes which aim to be acceptable to patients and providers, and cost-effective.},

	abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of acute stoke. Despite established efficacy, less than 3\% of stroke patients receive treatment, and that number is even smaller for patients living in remote locations. This is in part due to a lack of neurologists and stroke specialists in these rural communities. The traditional model of "ship and drip" wastes crucial time, resulting in delays or loss of treatment. In this review, we discuss strategies to overcome geographic disparities in stroke care and improve acute treatment in remote locations. Helicopter transport from field to stroke center is one option to rapidly deliver patients to stroke centers. However, geography, weather, and unnecessary transport are potential drawbacks. Alternatively, "telestroke" facilitates remote evaluation of acute stroke patients via an audiovisual link and transmission of computerized tomography images. Despite the physical separation, stroke specialists are able to examine patients, review brain imaging and make correct treatment decisions; transfer to a stroke center can then be performed as appropriate. A cost-benefit analysis of telestroke is needed, although the recent proliferation of telestroke networks suggests an economic asset to some hospital systems.},

	issn = {1872-7565},
	doi = {10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.12.029},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Data curation is a tedious task but of paramount relevance for data analytics and more specially in the health context where data-driven decisions must be extremely accurate. The ambition of TAQIH is to support non-technical users on 1) the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process of tabular health data, and 2) the assessment and improvement of its quality.
METHODS: A web-based tool has been implemented with a simple yet powerful visual interface. First, it provides interfaces to understand the dataset, to gain the understanding of the content, structure and distribution. Then, it provides data visualization and improvement utilities for the data quality dimensions of completeness, accuracy, redundancy and readability.
RESULTS: It has been applied in two different scenarios. (1) The Northern Ireland General Practitioners (GPs) Prescription Data, an open data set containing drug prescriptions. (2) A glucose monitoring tele health system dataset. Findings on (1) include: Features that had significant amount of missing values (e.g. AMP\_NM variable 53.39\%); instances that have high percentage of variable values missing (e.g. 0.21\% of the instances with {\textgreater} 75\% of missing values); highly correlated variables (e.g. Gross and Actual cost almost completely correlated (∼ + 1.0)). Findings on (2) include: Features that had significant amount of missing values (e.g. patient height, weight and body mass index (BMI) ({\textgreater} 70\%), date of diagnosis 13\%)); highly correlated variables (e.g. height, weight and BMI). Full detail of the testing and insights related to findings are reported.
CONCLUSIONS: TAQIH enables and supports users to carry out EDA on tabular health data and to assess and improve its quality. Having the layout of the application menu arranged sequentially as the conventional EDA pipeline helps following a consistent analysis process. The general description of the dataset and features section is very useful for the first overview of the dataset. The missing value heatmap is also very helpful in visually identifying correlations among missing values. The correlations section has proved to be supportive as a preliminary step before further data analysis pipelines, as well as the outliers section. Finally, the data quality section provides a quantitative value to the dataset improvements.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the health-related outcomes of short-term implementation of telemedicine (telemed) for MS patients.
METHODS: A prospective study of 40 MS patients divided into a control group and a telemed group was conducted, in two stages: A. Six months' follow-up for measurement of baseline health-related variables; B. Implementation stage, adding home telecare to the telemed group. A Health Value Compass was applied to assess the outcomes of home telecare implementation. Clinical status, cost data, patients' self-assessment of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and satisfaction with telecare were studied.
RESULTS: Patients in the telemed group demonstrated improved clinical outcome measured by symptoms severity. There was a decrease of at least 35\% in the medical costs for 67\% of the telemed group patients. Satisfaction with telecare was high and most patients would recommend this service to others.
CONCLUSIONS: The present pilot study, applying Health Value Compass-based analysis, suggests that telecare is a powerful tool for monitoring MS patients at home, carries the potential to improve health care while reducing costs, and should be considered for implementation as part of the management of chronic neurological diseases.},

Few tuberculosis laboratories have this item and the capital cost of \$5,000 for a high-end microscope could be a significant obstacle to MODS roll-out.
METHODOLOGY: We hypothesized that the precise definition provided by costly high-specification inverted light microscopes might not be necessary for pattern recognition.
SIGNIFICANCE: In this work we describe the development of a low-cost artesenal inverted microscope that can operate in both a standard or digital mode to effectively replace the expensive commercial inverted light microscope, and an integrated system that could permit a local and remote diagnosis of tuberculosis.},

The interview explored women's experience with telegenetics, satisfaction, perceived advantages and disadvantages and quality of the interaction with their genetic professionals. Overall women were highly satisfied with telegenetics. Telegenetics offered them convenience and reduced travel and associated costs. The majority of women described feeling a high degree of social presence, or rapport, with the off-site genetic clinician. One woman with a recent cancer diagnosis, reported that telemedicine was unable to meet her needs for psychosocial support. This finding highlights the need to be mindful of the psychosocial support needs of women with a recent diagnosis being seen via telegenetics.

METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with genetic practitioners (n=15) delivering telegenetics services in New South Wales, Australia. Interviews explored experiences, perceived aims of the service, satisfaction, and the advantages and disadvantages of the technology. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and thematically analyzed.
RESULTS: All practitioners were highly satisfied with telegenetics. They perceived the advantages of videoconferencing as primarily increased efficiency and convenience for genetic clinicians, minimized travel for the patient, reduced costs, and increased access to rural areas. Disadvantages included the inhibition of rapport building between genetic clinician and patient and the difficulty in detecting nonverbal cues. Telegenetics was seen as a structured interaction that allowed less time for emotional exploration than a traditional face-to-face consultation. Technical disadvantages involved visual resolution, connection speed, and interruptions to voice transmission.
CONCLUSION: Practitioners were satisfied with telegenetics and perceived the advantages as outweighing the disadvantages.},

Cost-effective translation of these technologies to remote and resource-limited environments could create new opportunities especially for telemedicine applications. Toward this direction, here we demonstrate the integration of imaging cytometry and fluorescent microscopy on a cell phone using a compact, lightweight, and cost-effective optofluidic attachment. In this cell-phone-based optofluidic imaging cytometry platform, fluorescently labeled particles or cells of interest are continuously delivered to our imaging volume through a disposable microfluidic channel that is positioned above the existing camera unit of the cell phone. The same microfluidic device also acts as a multilayered optofluidic waveguide and efficiently guides our excitation light, which is butt-coupled from the side facets of our microfluidic channel using inexpensive light-emitting diodes. Since the excitation of the sample volume occurs through guided waves that propagate perpendicular to the detection path, our cell-phone camera can record fluorescent movies of the specimens as they are flowing through the microchannel. The digital frames of these fluorescent movies are then rapidly processed to quantify the count and the density of the labeled particles/cells within the target solution of interest. We tested the performance of our cell-phone-based imaging cytometer by measuring the density of white blood cells in human blood samples, which provided a decent match to a commercially available hematology analyzer. We further characterized the imaging quality of the same platform to demonstrate a spatial resolution of {\textasciitilde}2 μm. This cell-phone-enabled optofluidic imaging flow cytometer could especially be useful for rapid and sensitive imaging of bodily fluids for conducting various cell counts (e.g., toward monitoring of HIV+ patients) or rare cell analysis as well as for screening of water quality in remote and resource-poor settings.},

Flow cytometry and optical microscopy are widely used techniques to perform blood analysis and therefore cost-effective translation of these technologies to resource limited settings is critical for various global health as well as telemedicine applications. In this chapter, we review our recent progress on the integration of imaging flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy on a cell phone using compact, light-weight and cost-effective opto-fluidic attachments integrated onto the camera module of a smartphone. In our cell-phone based opto-fluidic imaging cytometry design, fluorescently labeled cells are delivered into the imaging area using a disposable micro-fluidic chip that is positioned above the existing camera unit of the cell phone. Battery powered light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are butt-coupled to the sides of this micro-fluidic chip without any lenses, which effectively acts as a multimode slab waveguide, where the excitation light is guided to excite the fluorescent targets within the micro-fluidic chip. Since the excitation light propagates perpendicular to the detection path, an inexpensive plastic absorption filter is able to reject most of the scattered light and create a decent dark-field background for fluorescent imaging. With this excitation geometry, the cell-phone camera can record fluorescent movies of the particles/cells as they are flowing through the microchannel. The digital frames of these fluorescent movies are then rapidly processed to quantify the count and the density of the labeled particles/cells within the solution under test. With a similar opto-fluidic design, we have recently demonstrated imaging and automated counting of stationary blood cells (e.g., labeled white blood cells or unlabeled red blood cells) loaded within a disposable cell counting chamber. We tested the performance of this cell-phone based imaging cytometry and blood analysis platform by measuring the density of red and white blood cells as well as hemoglobin concentration in human blood samples, which showed a good match to our measurement results obtained using a commercially available hematology analyzer.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the safety, efficacy, and caregiver satisfaction of a remote monitoring system for home-based non-invasive positive pressure ventilation of children and infants with upper airway obstruction.
METHODS: Fourteen pediatric patients (age 50 days to 12 years) treated in our ENT unit from March 2009 to July 2011 and requiring home-based non-invasive positive pressure ventilation were enrolled in this feasibility study; one patient underwent CPAP and the other 13 patients underwent Bi-PAP. User satisfaction with the monitoring system was assessed by questionnaires given at regular intervals to parents and attending physicians. Compliance was determined by the number of days that parents uploaded data to the central server. In addition, the feasibility of the system was analyzed by comparing costs and time expenditures with traditional clinic visits.
RESULTS: The patients' parents (primary caregivers) uploaded data via the system on 93.3\% of trial days, indicating good compliance. No system or device failures occurred. Both parents and physicians considered the system convenient and ease to use according to {\textgreater}80\% of the returned questionnaires, indicating high user satisfaction. The mean distance between the patients' homes and the hospital was 113 ± 71 km, and parents required 371 ± 182 min to reach the hospital for a follow-up visit. In contrast, it took only 5.7 ± 3.1 min per day to transmit data (P{\textless}0.05 compared to hospital travel time). As of August 2011, average cost per patient was 632 Chinese yuan (¥), which was ¥924 (59.4\%) lower than the cost of clinic visits (¥1556).
CONCLUSIONS: The remote monitoring system was safe, reliable, easy to use, cost effective, and widely acceptable to both parents and physicians. This system may allow for safe and effective home-based non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for children with upper airway obstructions in developing countries with limited health care budgets or for patients from remote regions.},

Our method further achieves robust elimination of false positives via applying ratio-variation probability distributions filtering approaches. Moreover, it enables a much needed low-cost means for preventing sudden infant death syndrome in new born infants and detecting stroke and heart attack in elderly population in home environments.

The platform consists of an electrochemical microfluidic paper-based immunosensor array (E-μPIA) and a handheld multi-channel potentiostat, and is capable of performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays simultaneously on eight samples within 20 min (using a prepared E-μPIA). The multiplexing feature of the platform allows it to produce multiple measurement data for HIV and HCV markers from a single run, and its wireless communication module can transmit the results to a remote site for telemedicine.

	abstract = {Telemonitoring of electroencephalogram (EEG) through wireless body-area networks is an evolving direction in personalized medicine. Among various constraints in designing such a system, three important constraints are energy consumption, data compression, and device cost. Conventional data compression methodologies, although effective in data compression, consumes significant energy and cannot reduce device cost. Compressed sensing (CS), as an emerging data compression methodology, is promising in catering to these constraints. However, EEG is nonsparse in the time domain and also nonsparse in transformed domains (such as the wavelet domain). Therefore, it is extremely difficult for current CS algorithms to recover EEG with the quality that satisfies the requirements of clinical diagnosis and engineering applications. Recently, block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) was proposed as a new method to the CS problem. This study introduces the technique to the telemonitoring of EEG. Experimental results show that its recovery quality is better than state-of-the-art CS algorithms, and sufficient for practical use. These results suggest that BSBL is very promising for telemonitoring of EEG and other nonsparse physiological signals.},

	abstract = {Lens-free holographic microscopy can achieve wide-field imaging in a cost-effective and field-portable setup, making it a promising technique for point-of-care and telepathology applications. However, due to relatively narrow-band sources used in holographic microscopy, conventional colorization methods that use images reconstructed at discrete wavelengths, corresponding to e.g., red (R), green (G) and blue (B) channels, are subject to color artifacts. Furthermore, these existing RGB colorization methods do not match the chromatic perception of human vision. Here we present a high-color-fidelity and high-resolution imaging method, termed "digital color fusion microscopy" (DCFM), which fuses a holographic image acquired at a single wavelength with a color-calibrated image taken by a low-magnification lens-based microscope using a wavelet transform-based colorization method. We demonstrate accurate color reproduction of DCFM by imaging stained tissue sections. In particular we show that a lens-free holographic microscope in combination with a cost-effective mobile-phone-based microscope can generate color images of specimens, performing very close to a high numerical-aperture (NA) benchtop microscope that is corrected for color distortions and chromatic aberrations, also matching the chromatic response of human vision. This method can be useful for wide-field imaging needs in telepathology applications and in resource-limited settings, where whole-slide scanning microscopy systems are not available.},

	abstract = {A compact and low-power consuming fiber-optic anemometer based on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) coated tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) is presented. TFBG as a near infrared in-fiber sensing element is able to excite a number of cladding modes and radiation modes in the fiber and effectively couple light in the core to interact with the fiber surrounding mediums. It is an ideal in-fiber device used in a fiber hot-wire anemometer (HWA) as both coupling and sensing elements to simplify the sensing head structure. The fabricated TFBG was immobilized with an SWCNT film on the fiber surface. SWCNTs, a kind of innovative nanomaterial, were utilized as light-heat conversion medium instead of traditional metallic materials, due to its excellent infrared light absorption ability and competitive thermal conductivity. When the SWCNT film strongly absorbs the light in the fiber, the sensor head can be heated and form a "hot wire". As the sensor is put into wind field, the wind will take away the heat on the sensor resulting in a temperature variation that is then accurately measured by the TFBG. Benefited from the high coupling and absorption efficiency, the heating and sensing light source was shared with only one broadband light source (BBS) without any extra pumping laser complicating the system. This not only significantly reduces power consumption, but also simplifies the whole sensing system with lower cost. In experiments, the key parameters of the sensor, such as the film thickness and the inherent angle of the TFBG, were fully investigated. It was demonstrated that, under a very low BBS input power of 9.87 mW, a 0.100 nm wavelength response can still be detected as the wind speed changed from 0 to 2 m/s. In addition, the sensitivity was found to be -0.0346 nm/(m/s) under the wind speed of 1 m/s. The proposed simple and low-power-consumption wind speed sensing system exhibits promising potential for future long-term remote monitoring and on-chip sensing in practical applications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing cost in terms of money and healthcare resources is driving healthcare providers to provide home-based telecare instead of institutionalized healthcare. Falling is one of the most common and dangerous accidents for elderly individuals and a significant factor affecting the living quality of the elderly. Many efforts have been put toward providing a robust method to detect falls accurately and in a timely manner. This study facilitated a reliable, safe, and real-time home-based healthcare environment, which we have termed the Home Healthcare Sentinel System (HONEY), to detect falls for elderly people in the home telecare environment. The basic idea of HONEY is a three-step detection scheme that consists of multimodality signal sources, including an accelerometer sensor, audio, images, and video clips via speech recognition and on-demand video techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The magnitude of acceleration, corresponding to a user's movements, triggers fall detection combining speech recognition and on-demand video. If a fall occurs, an alarm e-mail is delivered to medical staff or caregivers at once, containing the fall information, so that caregivers could make a primary diagnosis based on it. This article also describes the implementation of the prototype of HONEY.
RESULTS: A comprehensive evaluation with 10 volunteers shows that HONEY has high accuracy of 94\% for fall detection, 18\% higher than the Advanced Magnitude Algorithm (AMA), which is a wearable sensor-based method, and the false-positive and false-negative rates are 3\% and 10\%, respectively, 19\% and 16\% lower than AMA, respectively. The average response time for a detected fall is 46.2 s, which is also short enough for first aid.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, HONEY provides a highly reliable and convenient fall detection solution for the home-based environment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The growing cost of health care and lack of specialised staff have set e-Health high on the European political agenda. In a prospective study we evaluated the effect of providing images for remote consultation through an iPad on the number of in-hospital orthopaedic consultations for children with bone fractures.
METHODS: Children from 0 to 18 years diagnosed with a bone fracture by the radiologist during the hours when an orthopaedic service is provided only on-call were eligible for enrollment. Cases were enrolled prospectively during September and October 2013. A standard approach (verbal information only, no X-Ray provided remotely) was compared to an experimental approach (standard approach plus the provision of X-ray for remote consultation through an iPad). The primary outcome was the number of orthopaedic in-hospital consultations that occurred. Other outcomes included: immediate activation of other services; time needed for decision-making; technical difficulties; quality of images and diagnostic confidence (on a likert scale of 1 to 10).
RESULTS: Forty-two children were enrolled in the study. Number of in-hospital consultancies dropped from 32/42 (76.1\%) when no X-ray was provided to 16/42 (38\%) when the X-rays was provided (p {\textless} 0.001). With remote X-ray consultation in 14/42 (33.3\%) cases services such as surgery and plaster room could be immediately activated, compared to no service activated without teleradiology (p {\textless} 0.001). Average time for decision making was 23.4 ± 21.8 minutes with remote X-ray consultation, compared to 56.2 ± 16.1 when the X-ray was not provided (p {\textless} 0.001). The comparison between images on the iPad and on the standard system for X- Ray visualisation resulted in a non statistically significant difference in the quality of images (average score 9.89 ± 0.37 vs 9.91 ± 0.30; p = 0.79), and in non statistically significant difference in diagnostic confidence (average score 9.91 ± 0.32 vs 9.92 ± 0.31; p = 0.88).
CONCLUSIONS: Remote X-ray consultation through Aycan OsiriX PRO and iPad should be considered as a means for reducing the need of in-hospital orthopaedic consultation during on-call times, and potentially decrease the cost of care for the health system. In the future, alternative systems less expensive than Aycan OsiriX PRO should be further developed and tested.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of point-of-care ultrasonography (POC US) in paediatrics is increasing. This study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of POC US in children accessing the emergency department (ED) when performed by paediatricians under the remote guidance of radiologists (TELE POC).
METHODS: Children aged 0 to 18 years accessing the ED of a third level research hospital with eight possible clinical scenarios and without emergency/severity signs at the triage underwent three subsequent US tests: by a paediatrician guided remotely by a radiologist (TELE POC); by the same radiologist (UNBLIND RAD); by an independent blinded radiologist (BLIND RAD). Tele-radiology was implemented using low cost "commercial off-the-shelf" (COTS) equipment and open-source software. Data were prospectively collected on predefined templates.
RESULTS: Fifty-two children were enrolled, for a total of 170 ultrasound findings. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of TELE POC were: 93.8, 99.7, 96.8, 99.4 when compared to UNBLIND RAD and 88.2, 99.7, 96.8, 98.7 when compared to BLIND RAD. The inter-observers agreement between the paediatricians and either the unblind or blind radiologist was excellent (k = 0.93). The mean duration of TELE POC was 6.3 minutes (95\% CI 4.1 to 8.5). Technical difficulties occurred in two (3.8\%) cases. Quality of the transmission was rated as fair, good, very good and excellent in 7.7\%, 15.4\%, 42.3\% and 34.6\% of cases respectively, while in no case was it rated as poor.
CONCLUSIONS: POC US performed by paediatricians in ED guided via tele-radiology by an expert radiologist (TELE POC) produced reliable and timely diagnoses. Findings of this study, especially for the rarer conditions under evaluation, need further confirmation. Future research should investigate the overall benefits and the cost savings of using tele-ultrasound to perform US "at children's bedsides", under remote guidance of expert radiologists.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The prevalence of skin diseases among prisoners is higher than in the general population. Diagnosing and treating these lesions require a dermatologic advice. A tele-expertise network in dermatology for prisoners including 8 health facilities in prison and 2 hospital dermatological departments was developed to improve access to dermatologists' expertise in correctional facilities. Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and costs of tele-expertise in dermatology for prisoners.
METHODS: We carried out a retrospective cohort study on data collected by the information system of the tele-expertise network. We used the MAST (Model for ASsessment of Telemedicine) model to perform a multidimensional assessment including the proportion of patients with a completed treatment plan for the skin lesions, the proportion of technical problems, the quality of the pictures, the investment and operating costs and the satisfaction of the professionals.
RESULTS: Mean patient age was 34.2 years with 90\% men. 511 requests for 450 patients were initiated. The delay from the connection to the tele-expertise software to the validation of the request was inferior to 7 min for 50\% of the requests and inferior to 30 min for 85\% of the requests. Overall, with tele-expertise, 82\% of the patients had a completed treatment plan for the skin lesions, with 2.9\% of all patients requiring a later face-to-face appointment or hospitalization, to be compared to a proportion of 35\% of patients with a completed treatment plan when tele-expertise was not available. The most frequent lesions were acnea (22\%) and atopic dermatitis (18\%). The mean cost for one completed treatment plan was €184 by tele-expertise and €315 without tele-expertise. Tele-expertise was well accepted among physicians with all responders (n = 9) willing to continue using it.
CONCLUSION: Tele-expertise is a dominant intervention in comparison to a face-to face consultation taking into account the cost of transportation and the proportion of canceled appointments and is acceptable for physicians.

Trauma patients in rural areas face more struggles than their urban counterparts because of the absence of specialized trauma care, delay in providing immediate care to trauma victims, and longer transport times to reach a trauma center. Telemedicine is a promising tool for facilitating rural trauma care. This stellar tool creates a real-time link between a remotely located specialist and the local healthcare provider, especially during the initial management of the trauma patient, involving resuscitation and even intubation. However, the high cost of purchasing, setting up, and maintaining all the needed equipment has made telemedicine an expensive proposition for rural hospitals, which frequently have limited budgets. But recently, new improvements in communication technology have made smartphones an indispensable part of daily life, even in rural areas. These devices have great potential to improve patient care and enhance medical education because of their wide adoption and ease of use.

A software infrastructure was deployed on the network to implement the collaboration platform among different healthcare facilities.
RESULTS: We obtained an integrated platform with modest investment in hardware and operating systems and no costs for application software. Messaging, content management, information sharing, and videoconferencing are among the available services of the infrastructure. Furthermore, open source software is managed and continuously updated by active communities, making it possible to obtain systems similar to commercial ones in terms of quality and reliability.
CONCLUSIONS: As the use of free software in public administration is being widely promoted across the European Union, our experience may provide an example to implement similar infrastructures in the field of healthcare and welfare.},

The proportion of transferred patients was 12.04\% (280/2324); lower than what was previously reported. The overall rate of IV tPA administration was 11.98\%. Transferred patients had a significantly higher NIHSS mean (10.93 vs. 6.73; P{\textless}0.001), and were more likely to have received IV-tPA at onset (25.57 vs. 9.67; P{\textless}0.001). The age, gender proportion, stroke mimic proportion, and the mean of OTS did not differ between the two-groups (0.49 vs. 0.31; P=0.38). A logistic regression showed that NIHSS (OR=1.06, P{\textless}0.001) and tPA administration at onset (OR=2.78, P{\textless}0.001) predict the transfer. Of the transferred patients, 4.5\% received endovascular intervention. The mortality rate of transferred patients was 12.9\%. Other outcomes were the following: 52\% discharge to rehabilitation facilities, 29\% discharge to home, and 8\% discharge to long-term nursing facilities.
CONCLUSION: Telestroke network is increasing the frequency of tPA usage in acute ischemic stroke and may decrease the need for transfer. Our aim was to optimize the stroke therapy to shorten the hospital stay and to increase the discharge home. This allows a better functional outcome and an additional benefit of cost-saving for the hospitals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nowadays, new organisational strategies should be identified to improve primary care and its link with secondary care in terms of efficacy and timeliness of interventions thus preventing unnecessary hospital accesses and costs saving for the health system. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of the use of teleconsultation by general practitioners in rural areas.
METHODS: General practitioners were provided with a teleconsultation service from 2006 to 2008 to obtain a second opinion for cardiac, dermatological and diabetic problems. Access, acceptance, organisational impact, effectiveness and economics data were collected. Clinical and access data were systematically entered in a database while acceptance and organisational data were evaluated through ad hoc questionnaires.
RESULTS: There were 957 teleconsultation contacts which resulted in access to health care services for 812 symptomatic patients living in 30 rural communities. Through the teleconsultation service, 48 general practitioners improved the appropriateness of primary care and the integration with secondary care. In fact, the level of concordance between intentions and consultations for cardiac problems was equal to 9\%, in 86\% of the cases the service entailed a saving of resources and in 5\% of the cases, it improved the timeliness. 95\% of the GPs considered the overall quality positively. For a future routine use of this service, trust in specialists, duration and workload of teleconsultations and reimbursement should be taken into account.
CONCLUSIONS: Managerial and policy implications emerged mainly related to the support to GPs in the provision of high quality primary care and decision-making processes in promoting similar services.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Today there is much debate about why telemedicine has stalled. Teleradiology is the only widespread telemedicine application. Other telemedicine applications appear to be promising candidates for widespread use, but they remain in the early adoption stage. The objective of this debate paper is to achieve a better understanding of the adoption of telemedicine, to assist those trying to move applications from pilot stage to routine delivery.
DISCUSSION: We have investigated the reasons why telemedicine has stalled by focusing on two, high-level topics: 1) the process of adoption of telemedicine in comparison with other technologies; and 2) the factors involved in the widespread adoption of telemedicine. For each topic, we have formulated hypotheses. First, the advantages for users are the crucial determinant of the speed of adoption of technology in healthcare. Second, the adoption of telemedicine is similar to that of other health technologies and follows an S-shaped logistic growth curve. Third, evidence of cost-effectiveness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the widespread adoption of telemedicine. Fourth, personal incentives for the health professionals involved in service provision are needed before the widespread adoption of telemedicine will occur.
SUMMARY: The widespread adoption of telemedicine is a major -- and still underdeveloped -- challenge that needs to be strengthened through new research directions. We have formulated four hypotheses, which are all susceptible to experimental verification. In particular, we believe that data about the adoption of telemedicine should be collected from applications implemented on a large-scale, to test the assumption that the adoption of telemedicine follows an S-shaped growth curve. This will lead to a better understanding of the process, which will in turn accelerate the adoption of new telemedicine applications in future. Research is also required to identify suitable financial and professional incentives for potential telemedicine users and understand their importance for widespread adoption.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators place a significant burden on health care systems. Remote monitoring allows assessment of device function and heart failure parameters, and may represent a safe, effective, and cost-saving method compared to conventional in-office follow-up.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that remote device monitoring represents a cost-effective approach. This paper summarizes the economic evaluation of the Evolution of Management Strategies of Heart Failure Patients With Implantable Defibrillators (EVOLVO) study, a multicenter clinical trial aimed at measuring the benefits of remote monitoring for heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators.
METHODS: Two hundred patients implanted with a wireless transmission-enabled implantable defibrillator were randomized to receive either remote monitoring or the conventional method of in-person evaluations. Patients were followed for 16 months with a protocol of scheduled in-office and remote follow-ups. The economic evaluation of the intervention was conducted from the perspectives of the health care system and the patient. A cost-utility analysis was performed to measure whether the intervention was cost-effective in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Overall, remote monitoring did not show significant annual cost savings for the health care system (€1962.78 versus €2130.01; P=.80). There was a significant reduction of the annual cost for the patients in the remote arm in comparison to the standard arm (€291.36 versus €381.34; P=.01). Cost-utility analysis was performed for 180 patients for whom QALYs were available. The patients in the remote arm gained 0.065 QALYs more than those in the standard arm over 16 months, with a cost savings of €888.10 per patient. Results from the cost-utility analysis of the EVOLVO study show that remote monitoring is a cost-effective and dominant solution.
CONCLUSIONS: Remote management of heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators appears to be cost-effective compared to the conventional method of in-person evaluations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an effective intervention for the management of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, available resources are often limited, and many patients bear with poor availability of programmes. Sustaining PR benefits and regular exercise over the long term is difficult without any exercise maintenance strategy. In contrast to traditional centre-based PR programmes, telerehabilitation may promote more effective integration of exercise routines into daily life over the longer term and broaden its applicability and availability. A few studies showed promising results for telerehabilitation, but mostly with short-term interventions. The aim of this study is to compare long-term telerehabilitation with unsupervised exercise training at home and with standard care.
METHODS/DESIGN: An international multicentre randomised controlled trial conducted across sites in three countries will recruit 120 patients with COPD. Participants will be randomly assigned to telerehabilitation, treadmill and control, and followed up for 2 years. The telerehabilitation intervention consists of individualised exercise training at home on a treadmill, telemonitoring by a physiotherapist via videoconferencing using a tablet computer, and self-management via a customised website. Patients in the treadmill arm are provided with a treadmill only to perform unsupervised exercise training at home. Patients in the control arm are offered standard care. The primary outcome is the combined number of hospitalisations and emergency department presentations. Secondary outcomes include changes in health status, quality of life, anxiety and depression, self-efficacy, subjective impression of change, physical performance, level of physical activity, and personal experiences in telerehabilitation.
DISCUSSION: This trial will provide evidence on whether long-term telerehabilitation represents a cost-effective strategy for the follow-up of patients with COPD. The delivery of telerehabilitation services will also broaden the availability of PR and maintenance strategies, especially to those living in remote areas and with no access to centre-based exercise programmes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intensive remote monitoring programs for congestive heart failure have been successful in reducing costly readmissions, but may not be appropriate for all patients. There is an opportunity to leverage the increasing accessibility of mobile technologies and consumer-facing digital devices to empower patients in monitoring their own health outside of the hospital setting. The iGetBetter system, a secure Web- and telephone-based heart failure remote monitoring program, which leverages mobile technology and portable digital devices, offers a creative solution at lower cost.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of using the iGetBetter system for disease self-management in patients with heart failure.
METHODS: This was a single-arm prospective study in which 21 ambulatory, adult heart failure patients used the intervention for heart failure self-management over a 90-day study period. Patients were instructed to take their weight, blood pressure, and heart rate measurements each morning using a WS-30 bluetooth weight scale, a self-inflating blood pressure cuff (Withings LLC, Issy les Moulineaux, France), and an iPad Mini tablet computer (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA, USA) equipped with cellular Internet connectivity to view their measurements on the Internet. Outcomes assessed included usability and satisfaction, engagement with the intervention, hospital resource utilization, and heart failure-related quality of life. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data, and matched controls identified from the electronic medical record were used as comparison for evaluating hospitalizations.
RESULTS: There were 20 participants (mean age 53 years) that completed the study. Almost all participants (19/20, 95\%) reported feeling more connected to their health care team and more confident in performing care plan activities, and 18/20 (90\%) felt better prepared to start discussions about their health with their doctor. Although heart failure-related quality of life improved from baseline, it was not statistically significant (P=.55). Over half of the participants had greater than 80\% (72/90 days) weekly and overall engagement with the program, and 15\% (3/20) used the interactive voice response telephone system exclusively for managing their care plan. Hospital utilization did not differ in the intervention group compared to the control group (planned hospitalizations P=.23, and unplanned hospitalizations P=.99). Intervention participants recorded shorter average length of hospital stay, but no significant differences were observed between intervention and control groups (P=.30).
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a low-intensive remote monitoring program leveraging commonly used mobile and portable consumer devices in augmenting care for a fairly young population of ambulatory patients with heart failure. Further prospective studies with a larger sample size and within more diverse patient populations is necessary to determine the effect of mobile-based remote monitoring programs such as the iGetBetter system on clinical outcomes in heart failure.},

The reduction of the number of in-office visits and the time to decision is proven, but the true clinical benefit is still unknown. Cost and cost-effectiveness of RM remain leading issues for its dissemination. The MONITOR-ICD study has been designed to assess costs, cost-effectiveness, and clinical benefits of RM versus standard-care follow-up in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients indicated for single- or dual-chamber ICD are eligible for the study and are implanted an RM-capable Biotronik ICD (Lumax VR-T or Lumax DR-T; Biotronik SE \& Co KG, Berlin, Germany). Implantable cardioverter defibrillator programming and alert-based clinical responses in the RM group are highly standardized by protocol. As of December 2011, recruitment has been completed, and 416 patients have been enrolled. Subjects are followed-up for a minimum of 12months and a maximum of 24months, ending in January 2013. Disease-specific costs from a societal perspective have been defined as primary end point and will be compared between RM and standard-care groups. Secondary end points include ICD shocks (including appropriate and inappropriate shocks), cardiovascular hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality, and additional health economic end points.
CONCLUSIONS: The MONITOR-ICD study will be an important randomized RM study to report data on a primary economic end point in 2014. Its results on ICD shocks will add to the currently available evidence on clinical benefit of RM.},

METHOD: A total of 52 veterans with combat-related PTSD were randomized to receive 8-12 weeks of PE through either home-based telehealth or standard in-person office-based care.
RESULTS: Participants evinced significant reductions in symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety from pre- to posttreatment across both conditions. Analyses conducted within a noninferiority framework suggested nonsignificant treatment outcome differences in clinician-reported PTSD and self-reported anxiety between the conditions. Results were inconclusive for self-reported PTSD and depression symptoms. Patient satisfaction ratings did not significantly differ between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that PE can be delivered via home-based telehealth with outcomes and satisfaction ratings comparable to in-person practices for certain symptoms, however additional research is needed. This modality has the potential to address stigma- and geographic-related barriers to treatment, such as travel time and cost.},

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost of ROP screening at a large centralized tertiary neonatal service for infants from regional/rural hospitals.
DESIGN: This is a retrospective study to establish the cost of transferring regional/rural infants to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital for ROP screening over a 28-month period.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 131 infants were included in this study.
METHODS: Individual infant costs were calculated from analysis of clinical and administrative records.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Economic cost of ROP screening for all transfers from regional/rural hospitals to Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.
RESULTS: The average economic cost of ROP screening for this cohort was AUD\$5110 per infant screened and the total cost was AUD\$669 413. The average cost per infant screened was highest for infants from a regional centre with a population of 75 000 (AUD\$14 856 per child), which was also geographically furthest from Brisbane. No infant in this cohort transferred from a regional nursery reached criteria for intervention for ROP by standard guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Health system costs for ROP screening of remote infants at a centralized hospital are high. Alternative strategies using telemedicine can now be compared with centralized screening.},

During phase one, 24 CHWs performed community-based hearing screening as part of their regular home visits over 12 weeks in an underserved community, using automated test protocols employed by the hearScreen™ smartphone application, operating on low-cost smartphones with calibrated headphones. During phase two, CHWs completed a questionnaire regarding their perceptions and experiences of the community-based screening programme.
RESULTS: Data analysis was conducted on the results of 108 children (2-15 years) and 598 adults (16-85 years). Referral rates for children and adults were 12\% and 6.5\% respectively. Noise exceeding permissible levels had a significant effect on screen results at 25 dB at 1 kHz (p{\textless}0.05). Age significantly affected adult referral rates (p {\textless} 0.05), demonstrating a lower rate (4.3\%) in younger as opposed to older adults (13.2\%). CHWs were positive regarding the hearScreen™ solution in terms of usability, need for services, value to community members and time efficiency.
CONCLUSION: Smartphone-based hearing screening allows CHWs to bring hearing health care to underserved communities at a primary care level. Active noise monitoring and data management features allow for quality control and remote monitoring for surveillance and follow-up.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hearing loss is one of the most common developmental disorders identifiable at birth with its prevalence increasing throughout school years. However, early detection programs are mostly unavailable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where more than 80\% of children with hearing loss reside.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the feasibility of a smartphone-based hearing screening program for preschool children operated by community healthcare workers (CHWs) in community-based early childhood development (ECD) centers.
METHOD: Five CHWs were trained to map ECD centers and conduct smartphone-based hearing screenings within a poor community in South Africa over a 12-month period. The hearScreenTM smartphone application employed automated test protocols operating on low-cost smartphones. A cloud-based data management and referral function allowed for remote monitoring for surveillance and follow up.
RESULTS: 6424 children (3-6 years) were screened for hearing loss with an overall referral rate of 24.9\%. Only 39.4\% of these children attended their follow-up appointment at a local clinic, of whom 40.5\% referred on their second screening. Logistic regression analysis indicated that age, gender and environmental noise levels (1 kHz) had a significant effect on referral rates (p {\textless} 0.05). The quality index reflecting test operator test quality increased during the first few months of testing.
CONCLUSION: Smartphone-based hearing screening can be used by CHWs to detect unidentified children affected by hearing loss within ECD centers. Active noise monitoring, quality indices of test operators and cloud-based data management and referral features of the hearScreenTM application allows for the asynchronous management of hearing screenings and follow-ups.},

Objective: To assess whether augmenting usual primary care with team-based intensive management lowers utilization and costs for high-risk patients.
Design: Randomized quality improvement trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03100526).
Setting: 5 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers.
Patients: Primary care patients at high risk for hospitalization who had a recent acute care episode.
Intervention: Locally tailored intensive management programs providing care coordination, goals assessment, health coaching, medication reconciliation, and home visits through an interdisciplinary team, including a physician or nurse practitioner, a nurse, and psychosocial experts.
Measurements: Utilization and costs (including intensive management program expenses) 12 months before and after randomization.
Results: 2210 patients were randomly assigned, 1105 to intensive management and 1105 to usual care. Patients had a mean age of 63 years and an average of 7 chronic conditions; 90\% were men. Of the patients assigned to intensive management, 487 (44\%) received intensive outpatient care (that is, ≥3 encounters in person or by telephone) and 204 (18\%) received limited intervention. From the pre- to postrandomization periods, mean inpatient costs decreased more for the intensive management than the usual care group (-\$2164 [95\% CI, -\$7916 to \$3587]). Outpatient costs increased more for the intensive management than the usual care group (\$2636 [CI, \$524 to \$4748]), driven by greater use of primary care, home care, telephone care, and telehealth. Mean total costs were similar in the 2 groups before and after randomization.
Limitations: Sites took up to several months to contact eligible patients, limiting the time between treatment and outcome assessment. Only VA costs were assessed.
Conclusion: High-risk patients with access to an intensive management program received more outpatient care with no increase in total costs.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite telemedicine's potential to improve patients' health outcomes and reduce costs in the ICU, hospitals have been slow to introduce telemedicine in the ICU due to high up-front costs and mixed evidence on effectiveness. This study's first aim was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of telemedicine in the ICU, compared with ICU without telemedicine, from the healthcare system perspective. The second aim was to examine potential cost saving of telemedicine in the ICU through probabilistic analyses and break-even analyses.
DESIGN: Simulation analyses performed by standard decision models.
SETTING: Hypothetical ICU defined by the U.S. literature.
PATIENTS: Hypothetical adult patients in ICU defined by the U.S. literature.
INTERVENTIONS: The intervention was the introduction of telemedicine in the ICU, which was assumed to affect per-patient per-hospital-stay ICU cost and hospital mortality. Telemedicine in the ICU operation costs included the telemedicine equipment-installation (start-up) costs with 5-year depreciation, maintenance costs, and clinician staffing costs. Telemedicine in the ICU effectiveness was measured by cumulative quality-adjusted life years for 5 years after ICU discharge.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The base case cost-effectiveness analysis estimated telemedicine in the ICU to extend 0.011 quality-adjusted life years with an incremental cost of \$516 per patient compared with ICU without telemedicine, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \$45,320 per additional quality-adjusted life year (= \$516/0.011). The probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \$50,265 with a wide 95\% CI from a negative value (suggesting cost savings) to \$375,870. These probabilistic analyses projected that cost saving is achieved 37\% of 1,000 iterations. Cost saving is also feasible if the per-patient per-hospital-stay operational cost and physician cost were less than \$422 and less than \$155, respectively, based on break-even analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest that telemedicine in the ICU is cost-effective in most cases and cost saving in some cases. The thresholds of cost and effectiveness, estimated by break-even analyses, help hospitals determine the impact of telemedicine in the ICU and potential cost saving.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemedicine in the intensive care unit (tele-ICU) is expected to address geographic health disparities through more efficient resource allocation. Our previous economic evaluation demonstrated tele-ICU to be cost-effective in most cases and cost saving in some cases, compared to conventional intensive care unit (ICU) care without adequate intensivist coverage.
INTRODUCTION: This study's objective is to examine how to optimize the cost-effectiveness of tele-ICU use by selecting highest risk (i.e., both highest mortality and highest cost) subpopulations. We also explore potential cost savings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted simulation analyses among a hypothetical adult ICU patient cohort defined by the literature, distinguishing four types of hospitals: urban tertiary (primary analysis), urban community, rural tertiary, and rural community. The selected tele-ICU use was assumed to affect per-patient ICU cost and hospital mortality among highest risk subpopulations (10-100\% of all ICU patients), defined by an established illness-severity measure.
RESULTS: We found a U-shaped relationship between the economic efficiency and selected tele-ICU use among all 4 hospital types. Optimal cost-effectiveness was achieved when tele-ICU was applied to the 30-40\% highest risk patients among all ICU patients (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = \$25,392 [2014 U.S. dollars] per extending a quality-adjusted life year) in urban tertiary hospitals (primary analysis). Our break-even analyses indicated that cost saving seems more feasible when reducing ICU medical care cost, rather than lowering the cost to operate telemedicine alone.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: A selected use of tele-ICU based on severity of illness is likely to improve tele-ICU cost-effectiveness. To achieve cost saving, tele-ICU must reduce more than just telemedicine-related cost.},

	doi = {10.2500/ajra.2017.31.4452},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies describe the financial burden of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) from the perspective of third-party payers, but, to our knowledge, none analyze the costs borne by patients (i.e., out-of-pocket expenses [OOPE]). Furthermore, this burden has not been previously investigated in the context of a publicly funded health care system.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the financial impact of CRS on patients, specifically by evaluating its associated OOPEs and the perceived financial burden. The secondary aim was to determine the factors predictive of OOPEs and perceived burden.
METHODS: Patients with CRS at a tertiary care sinus center completed a self-administered questionnaire that assessed their socioeconomic characteristics, disease-specific quality of life (22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test [SNOT-22]), workdays missed due to CRS, perceived financial burden, and direct medical and nonmedical OOPEs over a 12-month period. Total OOPEs were calculated from the sum of direct medical and nonmedical OOPEs. Regression analyses determined factors predictive of OOPEs and the perceived burden.
RESULTS: A total of 84 patients completed the questionnaires. After accounting for health insurance coverage and the median direct medical, direct nonmedical, and total OOPEs per patient over a 12-month period were Canadian dollars (CAD) \$336.00 (2011) [U.S. \$339.85], CAD \$129.87 [U.S. \$131.86], and CAD \$607.10 [U.S. \$614.06], respectively. CRS resulted in an average of 20.6 workdays missed over a 12-month period. Factors predictive of a higher financial burden included younger age, a greater number of previous sinus surgeries, {\textless}80\% health insurance coverage, residing out of town, and higher SNOT-22 scores.
CONCLUSION: Total OOPEs incurred from the treatment of CRS may amount to CAD \$607.10 [U.S. \$614.06] per patient per year, within the context of a single-payer health care system. Managing clinicians should be aware of patient groups with a greater perceived financial burden and consider counseling them on strategies to offset expenses, including obtaining travel grants, using telemedicine for follow-up assessments, providing drug samples, and streamlining diagnostic testing with medical visits.},

	abstract = {Introduction In this paper the economic costs associated with a growing, multi-state telepsychiatry intervention serving rural American Indian/Alaska Native populations were compared to costs of travelling to provide/receive in-person treatment. Methods Telepsychiatry costs were calculated using administrative, information-technology, equipment and technology components, and were compared to travel cost models. Both a patient travel and a psychiatrist travel model were estimated utilising ArcGIS software and unit costs gathered from literature and government sources. Cost structure and sensitivity analysis was also calculated by varying modeling parameters and assumptions. Results and Discussion It is estimated that per-session costs were \$93.90, \$183.34, and \$268.23 for telemedicine, provider-travel, and patient-travel, respectively. Restricting the analysis to satellite locations with a larger number of visits reduced telemedicine per-patient encounter costs (50 or more visits: \$83.52; 100 or more visits: \$80.41; and 150 or more visits: \$76.25). The estimated cost efficiencies of telemedicine were more evident for highly rural communities. Finally, we found that a multi-state centre was cheaper than each state operating independently. Conclusions Consistent with previous research, this study provides additional evidence of the economic efficiency associated with telemedicine interventions for rural American Indian/Alaska Native populations. Our results suggest that there are economies of scale in providing behavioural telemedicine and that bigger, multi-state telemedicine centres have lower overall costs compared to smaller, state-level centres. Additionally, results suggest that telemedicine structures with a higher number of per-satellite patient encounters have lower costs, and telemedicine centres delivering care to highly rural populations produce greater economic benefits.},

	abstract = {Oil pollution in the marine environment is an unavoidable problem due to chronic input from local sources, particularly in urban areas and oil spills. Oil pollution not only causes immediate physical damages to surrounding wildlife but also some components, including higher molecular weight PAHs, can persist in the environment for many years and pose insidious threats to the ecosystem. Long-term and nontargeted monitoring of oil pollution is important. This paper examines the ability of International Pellet Watch (IPW) for initial identification and monitoring of oil pollution by analysing PAHs and hopanes in plastic pellet samples collected globally by volunteers. PAH concentrations with the sum of 28 parent and methyl PAHs vary geographically, ranging from 0.035 to 24.4 µg/g-pellet, in line with the presence or absence of local oil pollution sources, such as oil refineries or oil spill sites. This suggests that PAHs can be used to monitor petroleum pollution in IPW. A colour-coded categorization for PAH concentrations within IPW monitoring also is established to facilitate data presentation and understanding. PAH concentrations are generally higher in Western Europe, especially around the North Sea shorelines, moderate in East Asia and North America, and lower in South East Asia, Oceania, South America, and Africa. Hopane concentrations, with a smaller spatial variation (1.7-101 µg/g-pellet), showed no spatial pattern. This result and the poor correlation between hopanes and PAHs suggest that hopane concentrations alone are unsuited to identify petroleum pollution. However, hopane compositions can be used for fingerprinting sources of oil pollution. Thus, both PAHs and hopanes in IPW allow for low cost, remote monitoring of global oil pollution.},

The environmental impact of healthcare practices in the country has been largely disregarded due to ambivalence, ignorance, and fears of additional costs and regulations. The current practices continue to pollute the environment by requiring large amounts of travel and paperwork by both the patient and the clinician. Telemedicine and health information technology help save time, energy, raw materials (such as paper and plastic), and fuel, thereby lowering the carbon footprint of the health industry. By implementing green practices, for instance, by engaging in carbon credit programs, the health industry could benefit financially as well as reduce its negative impact on the health of our planet. Companies that reduce their carbon emissions by implementing energy-saving practices can sell their carbon credits to companies that emit more carbon than permissible by their legally binding commitment. These carbon profits can then be used for healthcare research or to provide healthcare to the underserved. Alternatively, the savings could be used for green purchasing and to implement other carbon-reducing activities. This report reviews the numerous possible options for the American health industry to become greener and lower its carbon footprint while at the same time becoming more time- and cost efficient.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In recent years, a variety of clinical decision-support systems (CDSS) have been developed to monitor the health of patients with chronic disease from far away. These systems are effective in overcoming human resource limitation and analyzing information generated by Tele-monitoring systems. These systems, however, are limited to monitoring a particular disease, which allows them to be used only in one specific disease. In reuses of these systems to monitor other diseases, we need to re-establish a new system with a new knowledge base. However, this type of healthcare system faces many challenges, including low scalability for change, so that, if we want to modify a health monitoring system designed for a specific disease to be used for another disease, these changes will be very substantial, meaning that, most components of that system should be changed. The lack of scalability in these systems has led to the creation of multiple health monitoring systems, while many of these systems share a common structure.
Aim: In this paper, to solve the scalability problem, architecture has been presented that allows a set of CDSSs to be placed on a common platform for Tele-monitoring.
Material and methods: In order to provide the proposed architecture in this study, we extracted the related concepts from the literature. The anatomical concepts used in these studies are as follow: users, transmitted data, patient data storage databases, data transfer network, and medical setting and the work is done in this setting. Finally, to design the proposed architecture, UML has been used.
Results: The innovation of this research is to provide a scalable and flexible architecture, which as a platform, is able to monitor multiple diseases with a common infrastructure. In this architecture, all components are commonly used simultaneously without the interference of several CDSSs.
Conclusion: Utilizing the proposed model in this paper, while reducing the setup costs and speeding up the launch of various remote monitoring systems, many rework in the implementation of these systems is also reduced.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Although self-measurement of home blood pressure (HBP) is common in Japan and HBP telemonitoring via the Internet is possible, whether telemonitoring improves HBP control better than conventional practice remains unclear. Furthermore, hypertension care with online communication using telemonitored HBP is feasible, whereas the efficacy and safety of such telemedicine have not been established. We aim to compare traditional care, care with office visits using HBP telemonitoring, and antihypertensive telemedicine based on HBP telemonitoring.
METHODS AND DESIGN: In total, 444 patients with uncontrolled hypertension will be recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: (1) control: usual care with office visits and HBP self-report, (2) telemonitoring: weekly assessment of transmitted HBP by physicians and treatment adjustment upon office visits, or (3) telemedicine: online communication instead of office visits to adjust medication using telemonitored HBP. Primary outcome is the time to control of HBP, and secondary outcomes include achieved HBP levels, adherence, treatment intensity, adverse events, patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness.
DISCUSSION: Hypertension care with telemonitoring and telemedicine are expected to require shorter time to achieve HBP control compared to usual care. Combining HBP telemonitoring with telemedicine may lower the hurdles for starting and persisting to hypertension treatment and eventually reduce cardiovascular events.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Store-and-forward (SAF) teledermatology (TD) has the potential to increase access to timely, high-quality care for underserved populations. However, the cost-effectiveness of TD for underserved populations is uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the potential cost savings associated with an SAF TD program implemented for an underserved population in the city health clinics of urban Philadelphia.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of SAF TD consultations for 700 outpatients managed in 12 Philadelphia primary care clinics. Primary care providers were asked to specify a treatment plan, as well as the type of care for the patient, in the absence of the TD service. Analysis compared the cost of each patient case with use of the TD consult model versus with conventional care.
RESULTS: In all, 27\% of in-person dermatology clinic visits (189 of 700) and 3.29\% of emergency room visits (23 of 700) were avoided by using TD. Compared with conventional care, TD had a mean expected cost savings of \$10.00 to \$52.65 per TD consult. In sensitivity analyses, these estimated savings remained positive across a range of parameters.
LIMITATIONS: The cost analysis relies on several assumptions regarding the cost of care, and indirect costs were not included.
CONCLUSION: TD can be a cost-saving model while increasing access to dermatologic care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comprehensive economic evaluations have not been conducted on telemedicine consultations to children in rural emergency departments (EDs).
OBJECTIVE: We conducted an economic evaluation to estimate the cost, effectiveness, and return on investment (ROI) of telemedicine consultations provided to health care providers of acutely ill and injured children in rural EDs compared with telephone consultations from a health care payer prospective.
METHODS: We built a decision model with parameters from primary programmatic data, national data, and the literature. We performed a base-case cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), a probabilistic CEA with Monte Carlo simulation, and ROI estimation when CEA suggested cost-saving. The CEA was based on program effectiveness, derived from transfer decisions following telemedicine and telephone consultations.
RESULTS: The average cost for a telemedicine consultation was \$3641 per child/ED/year in 2013 US dollars. Telemedicine consultations resulted in 31\% fewer patient transfers compared with telephone consultations and a cost reduction of \$4662 per child/ED/year. Our probabilistic CEA demonstrated telemedicine consultations were less costly than telephone consultations in 57\% of simulation iterations. The ROI was calculated to be 1.28 (\$4662/\$3641) from the base-case analysis and estimated to be 1.96 from the probabilistic analysis, suggesting a \$1.96 return for each dollar invested in telemedicine. Treating 10 acutely ill and injured children at each rural ED with telemedicine resulted in an annual cost-savings of \$46,620 per ED.
LIMITATIONS: Telephone and telemedicine consultations were not randomly assigned, potentially resulting in biased results.
CONCLUSIONS: From a health care payer perspective, telemedicine consultations to health care providers of acutely ill and injured children presenting to rural EDs are cost-saving (base-case and more than half of Monte Carlo simulation iterations) or cost-effective compared with telephone consultations.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The implementation of a pharmacy-directed antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) program involving the use of telemedicine technology is described.
SUMMARY: Pursuant to a gap analysis of AMS services at a rural hospital where physician specialists in infectious diseases (ID) or pharmacists with advanced ID training were not available, a multidisciplinary team was formed to implement a stewardship program targeting six antimicrobials with a high potential for misuse. A key part of the program was the participation of a remotely located ID physician specialist in weekly case review teleconferences. An evaluation of the first 13 months of the initiative (May 2010-June 2011) indicated that pharmacist-initiated AMS interventions increased dramatically after program implementation, from a baseline average of 2.1 interventions per week to an average of 6.8 per week; the rate of antimicrobial streamlining increased from 44\% to an average of 96\%. Due to inconsistent documentation, an increase in the rate of physician-pharmacist agreement could not be demonstrated; however, anecdotal evidence suggested an increase in physician requests for case reviews by the AMS team and enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration. An analysis of 2010 purchasing data demonstrated a decrease in annual antibiotic costs of about 28\% from 2009 levels (and a further decrease of about 51\% in the first two quarters of 2011). The rate of nosocomial Clostridium difficile infection decreased from an average of 5.5 cases per 10,000 patient-days to an average of 1.6 cases per 10,000 patient-days.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of an AMS program at a rural hospital led to increases in pharmacist-recommended interventions and streamlining of antimicrobial therapy, as well as decreases in health care-associated C. difficile infections and antimicrobial purchasing costs.},

We assessed patient use of and satisfaction with these interventions. A return on investment (ROI) analysis was conducted to determine the cost savings generated by EpxWound and EpxDecol.
RESULTS: The proportions of patients who responded daily to EpxDecol and EpxWound were 91.9\% and 77.7\%, respectively, over the lengths of each intervention. The percent of daily responders declined {\textless}5\% during each intervention. Ultimately, 88.4\% of EpxDecol patients and 67.8\% of EpxWound patients responded to ≥80\% of all messages. Median patient survey responses (n = 1,246) were 9/9 (best possible) for care, 8/9 for improved communication, and 5/9 (perfect number) for number of messages received. ROI analysis for this 88-week period showed that using EpxDecol and EpxWound to engage patients (instead of nurses calling patients) saved the equivalent of 2.275 full-time nursing equivalents per week. We calculated net savings of \$260,348 with an ROI of 14.85x for 1,753 patients over 88 weeks. One-year cost savings from these interventions were \$153,800 with an ROI of 14.79x.
CONCLUSIONS: EpxDecol and EpxWound may serve important roles in the perioperative process for orthopedic joint reconstruction surgery given high patient usage of and satisfaction with these interventions. Implementing EpxDecol and EpxWound for a large patient population could yield substantial cost savings and ROI.},

	doi = {10.1177/1357633X15577531},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Telemedicine offers rural hospitals the ability to treat acute ischemic stroke on site with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Most patients are subsequently transferred to a hub hospital with a primary stroke center for post t-PA care. There is little evidence that such transfer is beneficial. The purpose of our study is to determine whether the transfer of patients to hub hospitals is beneficial.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from our prospectively collected cohort in the AR SAVES (Stroke Assistance through Virtual Emergency Support) telestroke network from November 2008 till January 2012. We compared the outcome of patients who were transferred to a "hub" with those who remained at the "spoke" hospital where thrombolysis took place. We stratified patients according to stroke severity using admission NIHSS scores into two groups: patients with mild stroke (NIHSS {\textless}8) and those with moderate to severe stroke (NIHSS ≥8). We defined good outcome as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤2. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test, two-tailed, and significance was considered at p {\textless} 0.05.
RESULTS: Out of 894 telestroke consultations, 206 patients received thrombolytic therapy; 134 patients had moderate to severe strokes and 160 patients (78\%) were transferred to the hub after thrombolytic therapy. The percentage of patients with good outcome at 3 months was similar between patients transferred to hub and those who stayed at the spoke (61\% vs. 55\%, p = NS). However, when only patients with moderate to severe strokes were analyzed, patients transferred to the hub were more likely to have good outcomes at three months post t-PA (50\% versus 24\%, p = 0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with moderate to severe ischemic strokes who were treated with t-PA in a telestroke network may potentially benefit from expert care at a primary stroke center.},

Telemedicine is a promising solution to help increase access to needed health care. We evaluated telemedicine's effectiveness in delivering endocrinology care from Atlanta-based endocrinologists.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who were enrolled in the Atlanta VAMC Endocrinology Telehealth Clinic from June 2014 to October 2016. Outcomes of interest were hemoglobin A1c levels, changes in glycemic control, time savings for patients, cost savings for the US Veterans Health Administration, appointment adherence rates, and patient satisfaction with telehealth.
RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with type 1 diabetes received telehealth care and in general received the recommended processes of diabetes care. Patients trended toward a decrease in mean hemoglobin A1c and glucose variability and a nonsignificant increase in hypoglycemic episodes. Patients saved 78 minutes of travel time (one way), and the VA saved \$72.94 in travel reimbursements per patient visit. Patients adhered to 88\% of scheduled telehealth appointments on average, and 100\% of surveyed patients stated they would recommend telehealth to other veterans.
CONCLUSIONS: Specialty diabetes care delivered via telemedicine was safe and was associated with time savings, cost savings, high appointment adherence rates, and high patient satisfaction. Our findings support growing evidence that telemedicine is an effective alternative method of health care delivery.},

	abstract = {High-gain photodetectors with near-infrared (NIR) sensitivity are critical for biomedical applications such as photoplethysmography and optical coherence tomography where detected optical signals are relatively weak. Current photodetection technologies rely on avalanche photodiodes and photomultipliers to achieve high sensitivity. These devices, however, require a high operation voltage and are not compatible with CMOS based read-out circuits (ROCs). In this work we demonstrate a solution-proceeded NIR phototransistor structure based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) of a narrow bandgap polymer, poly(N-alkyl diketopyrrolo-pyrrole dithienylthieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (DPP-DTT), and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methylester (PCBM). The device exhibits ultrahigh responsivity (∼5 × 10(5) A W(-1)) as well as wide tunability ({\textgreater}1 × 10(4)) of photoconductive gain. Using the current-voltage and transient photocurrent measurements we show that the high responsivity is due to the combined effects of fast transport of holes in the polymer matrix and slow detrapping of electrons from the isolated PCBM domains. The wide gain tunability and the efficient suppression of noise current are achieved through the use of the optically tunable gate terminal. We demonstrate that our phototransistor can be used as the detection unit in a photoplethysmography sensor for non-invasive, continuous finger pulse wave monitoring. The high-sensitivity of the phototransistor allows the use of a low-power light source, thus reducing the overall power consumption of the sensor. This, together with the solution processibility and the simple device configuration (which is compatible with conventional ROCs), make the phototransistor a very promising component for the next generation low-cost, mobile biomedical devices for health monitoring and remote diagnostics.},

The objective of this study was to identify the least-cost approach to providing ENT services for paediatric outpatients.
METHODS: A cost-minimisation analysis was conducted comparing the annual costs of the two modes of service provided by the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) in Brisbane. Activity records were reviewed to analyse volume of activity during a 12 month period in 2005, i.e. number of clinics, duration of clinics, number of consultations via telemedicine and in outpatient clinics, diagnoses, and travel related information. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using factors where there was some uncertainty or potential future variation.
RESULTS: During the study period, 88 ENT consultations were conducted via videoconference for 70 patients at Bundaberg Base Hospital. 177 ENT consultations were conducted at the RCH for 117 patients who had travelled from the Bundaberg region to Brisbane. The variable cost of providing the tele-ENT service was A\$108 per consultation, compared with A\$155 per consultation for the conventional outpatient service. Telemedicine was cheaper when the workload exceeded 100 consultations per year. If all 265 consultations were conducted as tele-ENT consultations, the cost-savings would be \$7,621.
CONCLUSION: The cost-minimisation analysis demonstrated that under the circumstances described in this paper, the tele-ENT service was a more economical method for the health department of providing specialist ENT services.},

To create an intelligent ECG monitoring system, an efficient and quick detection algorithm for the characteristic waveforms is needed. This paper aims to give a quick and effective method for detecting QRS-complexes and R-waves in ECGs. The real ECG signal from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database is used for the performance evaluation. The method proposed combined a wavelet transform and the K-means clustering algorithm. A wavelet transform is adopted in the data analysis and preprocessing. Then, based on the slope information of the filtered data, a segmented K-means clustering method is adopted to detect the QRS region. Detection of the R-peak is based on comparing the local amplitudes in each QRS region, which is different from other approaches, and the time cost of R-wave detection is reduced. Of the tested 8 records (total 18201 beats) from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, an average R-peak detection sensitivity of 99.72 and a positive predictive value of 99.80\% are gained; the average time consumed detecting a 30-min original signal is 5.78s, which is competitive with other methods.},

A secure authentication scheme will thus be needed to safeguard data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Many schemes based on cryptography have been proposed for the goals. However, much of the schemes are vulnerable to various attacks, and are neither efficient, nor user friendly.

Therefore, we propose a novel authentication scheme that is added the pre-computing idea within the communication process to avoid the time-consuming exponential computations. Finally, it is shown to be more secure and practical for telecare medicine environments.},

	abstract = {Teleophthalmology (TeleOph) is an electronic counterpart of today's face-to-face, patient-to-specialist ophthalmology system. It enables one or more ophthalmologists to remotely examine a patient's condition via a confidential and authentic communication channel. Specifically, TeleOph allows a trained nonspecialist in a primary clinic to screen the patients with digital instruments (e.g., camera, ophthalmoscope). The acquired medical data are delivered to the hospital where an ophthalmologist will review the data collected and, if required, provide further consultation for the patient through a real-time secure channel established over a public Internet network. If necessary, the ophthalmologist is able to further sample the images/video of the patient's eyes remotely. In order to increase the productivity of the ophthalmologist in terms of number of patients reviewed, and to increase the efficiency of network resource, we manage the network bandwidth based on a Poisson model to estimate patient arrival at the clinics, and the rate of ophthalmologist consultation service for better overall system efficiency. The main objective of TeleOph is therefore to provide the remote patients with a cost-effective access to specialist's eye checkups at primary healthcare clinics, and at the same time, minimize unnecessary face-to-face consultation at the hospital specialist's center.},

In this study, based on the joint sparsity of data, we proposed an advanced hybrid technique of distributed compressed sensing (DCS) and joint sparse representation classification (JSRC) for multi-sensor gait classification. Firstly, the DCS technique is utilized to simultaneously compress multi-sensor gait data for capturing spatio-temporal correlation information about gait while the energy efficiency of the sensors is available. Then, the jointly compressed gait data are directly used to develop a novel neighboring sample-based JSRC model by defining the sparse representation coefficients-inducing criterion (SRCC), in order to yield the best classification performance as well as a lower computational time cost. The multi-sensor gait data were selected from an open wearable action recognition database (WARD) to validate the feasibility of our proposed method. The results showed that when the comparison ratio and the number of neighboring samples are selected as 70\% and 40\%, respectively, the best accuracy (95\%) can be reached while the lowest computational time spends only 60 ms. Moreover, the best accuracy and the computational time can increase by 5\% and decrease by 40 ms, respectively, when compared with the traditional JSRC techniques. Our proposed hybrid technique can take advantage of the joint sparsity of data for jointly processing multi-sensor gait data, which greatly contributes to the best gait-classification performance. This has great potential for energy-efficient telemonitoring of multi-sensor gait.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an important health problem in Western countries and also in Asia. It is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women in Taiwan. According to the well-known adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence, the majority of CRC develops from colorectal adenomatous polyps. This concept provides the rationale for screening and prevention of CRC. Removal of colorectal adenoma could reduce the mortality and incidence of CRC. Mobile phones are now playing an ever more crucial role in people's daily lives. The latest generation of smartphones is increasingly viewed as hand-held computers rather than as phones, because of their powerful on-board computing capability, capacious memories, large screens, and open operating systems that encourage development of applications (apps).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: If we can detect the potential CRC patients early and offer them appropriate treatments and services, this would not only promote the quality of life, but also reduce the possible serious complications and medical costs. In this study, an intelligent CRC screening app on Android™ (Google™, Mountain View, CA) smartphones has been developed based on a data mining approach using decision tree algorithms. For comparison, the stepwise backward multivariate logistic regression model and the fecal occult blood test were also used.
RESULTS: Compared with the stepwise backward multivariate logistic regression model and the fecal occult blood test, the proposed app system not only provides an easy and efficient way to quickly detect high-risk groups of potential CRC patients, but also brings more information about CRC to customer-oriented services.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and implemented an app system on Android platforms for ubiquitous healthcare services for CRC screening. It can assist people in achieving early screening, diagnosis, and treatment purposes, prevent the occurrence of complications, and thus reach the goal of preventive medicine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The traditional otorhinoendoscope is widely used in the diagnosis of a variety of ear and nose diseases, but only one doctor can use it at a time. It is also very difficult to share observations from one doctor with another doctor. With advances in electronic health technology, the extended potential application of smartphones to support medical practice or mobile health has grown steadily.
OBJECTIVE: The first phase of the study discussed how smartphones may be used for otorhinoscopic imaging and image management via an innovative adaptor. The second phase of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic capability of the smartphone-based otorhinoendoscope, as compared to the traditional otorhinoendoscope, and its application in mobile health and teleotolaryngology.
METHODS: We designed a unique adaptor to connect the otorhinoendoscope and smartphone in order to perform smartphone-based otorhinoendoscopy. The main aim was to transform the smartphone into an otorhinoendoscope. We devised a method that would allow us to use the smartphone's camera to capture otorhinoscopic images. Using a freely available Web-based real-time communication application platform and the 3G (or WIFI) network, the smartphone-based otorhinoendoscope could synchronize the smartphone-based otorhinoscopic image with smartphones, tablet PCs, computer notebooks, or personal computers.
RESULTS: We investigated the feasibility of telemedicine using a smartphone, tablet PC, and computer notebook. Six types of clinical otorhinoscopic images were acquired via the smartphone-based otorhinoendoscope from six patients, which were examined in this study. Three teleconsultants (doctors A, B, and C) reviewed the six types of clinical otorhinoscopic images and made a telediagnosis. When compared to the face-to-face diagnosis, which was made in-person via a traditional otorhinoendoscope, the three teleconsultants obtained scores of a correct primary telediagnosis 83\% (5/6), 100\% (6/6), and 100\% (6/6) of the time, respectively. When the clinical data were provided, the three teleconsultants obtained a correct secondary telediagnosis score of 100\% (6/6), 100\% (6/6), and 100\% (6/6) of the time, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of previously available technologies in the absence of any additional expensive devices could significantly increase the quality of diagnostics while lowering extraneous costs. Furthermore, this could also increase the connectivity between most isolated family doctors and remote referral centers.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Few studies have addressed the effects of caregiver interventions on the costs of care for the care recipient. This study evaluated the effects of a caregiver education and support group delivered via the telephone on care recipient health care utilization and cost.
DESIGN AND METHODS: The Telehealth Education Program (TEP) is a manualized program of education and support designed for caregivers of veterans with moderate-to-severe dementia. One hundred fifty-eight spousal caregivers were randomly assigned to either the ten 1-hr sessions of TEP or the usual care (UC). Health care utilization and cost data were extracted from veterans Information System Technology Architecture databases and included outpatient, inpatient, and nursing home data within the VA.
RESULTS: Total health care cost data showed a significant (p = .039) average cost savings of \$2,768 per patient at 6 months for TEP as compared with UC, but these were not maintained at 1 year. All costs included in the total costs measure contributed to this difference. Inpatient, outpatient, and nursing home costs were all assessed separately, but only nursing home costs reached significance (p = .009), with a savings of \$1,057 per patient at 6 months.
IMPLICATIONS: The TEP caregiver intervention resulted in short-term cost savings for veteran care recipients. Future studies of caregiver interventions should examine their effects on costs of care for the care recipients in addition to their effects on caregiver outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of technology such as computers, tablets, and smartphones to improve access to and the delivery of mental health care (eMental Health care) is growing worldwide. However, despite the rapidly expanding evidence base demonstrating the efficacy of eMental Health care, its implementation in clinical practice and health care systems remains fragmented. To date, no peer-reviewed, key-informant studies have reported on the perspectives of decision-makers concerned with whether and how to implement eMental Health care.
METHODS: From September to November 2015, we conducted 31 interviews with key informants responsible for leadership, policy, research, and/ or information technology in organizations influential in the adoption of technology for eMental Health care. Deductive and inductive thematic analyses of transcripts were conducted using the Behavior Change Wheel as an organizing framework. Frequency and intensity effect sizes were calculated for emerging themes to further explore patterns within the data.
RESULTS: Key informant responses (n = 31) representing 6 developed countries and multiple organizations showed consensus on common factors impacting implementation: individual and organizational capacities (e.g., computer literacy skills [patients and providers], knowledge gaps about cyber security, limited knowledge of available services); motivational drivers of technology-based care (e.g., extending care, data analytics); and opportunities for health systems to advance eMental Health care implementation (e.g., intersectoral research, rapid testing cycles, sustainable funding). Frequency effect sizes showed strong associations between implementation and credibility, knowledge, workflow, patient empowerment, electronic medical record (EMR) integration, sustained funding and intersectoral networks. Intensity effect sizes showed the highest concentration of statements ({\textgreater}10\% of all comments) related to funding, credibility, knowledge gaps, and patient empowerment.
CONCLUSION: This study provides previously unavailable information about key informant perspectives on eMental Health care implementation. The themes that emerged, namely the need to intensify intersectoral research, measure/monitor readiness to implement, define cost-utility benchmarks, raise awareness about available technologies, and test assumptions that 'proven' technologies will be easily integrated can inform the design and evaluation of eMental Health care implementation models.},

Telemedicine was considered to have assisted with the diagnosis in all cases (median score 5 on a five-point scale from 1 = not helpful at all to 5 = very good/excellent). The advice to the referring doctor for further action was considered helpful in all except one case (median score 5 on the same scale). The outcome for the patient was considered to be good in 15 of the cases (median score 4 on the same scale).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemedicine has been used for many years to support doctors in the developing world. Several networks provide services in different settings and in different ways. However, to draw conclusions about which telemedicine networks are successful requires a method of evaluating them. No general consensus or validated framework exists for this purpose.
OBJECTIVE: To define a basic method of performance measurement that can be used to improve and compare teleconsultation networks; to employ the proposed framework in an evaluation of three existing networks; to make recommendations about the future implementation and follow-up of such networks.
METHODS: Analysis based on the experience of three telemedicine networks (in operation for 7-10 years) that provide services to doctors in low-resource settings and which employ the same basic design.
FINDINGS: Although there are many possible indicators and metrics that might be relevant, five measures for each of the three user groups appear to be sufficient for the proposed framework. In addition, from the societal perspective, information about clinical- and cost-effectiveness is also required. The proposed performance measurement framework was applied to three mature telemedicine networks. Despite their differences in terms of activity, size and objectives, their performance in certain respects is very similar. For example, the time to first reply from an expert is about 24 hours for each network. Although all three networks had systems in place to collect data from the user perspective, none of them collected information about the coordinator's time required or about ease of system usage. They had only limited information about quality and cost.
CONCLUSION: Measuring the performance of a telemedicine network is essential in understanding whether the network is working as intended and what effect it is having. Based on long-term field experience, the suggested framework is a practical tool that will permit organisations to assess the performance of their own networks and to improve them by comparison with others. All telemedicine systems should provide information about setup and running costs because cost-effectiveness is crucial for sustainability.},

OBJECTIVE: To propose a mechanism for implementing the clearing house concept for sharing expertise, and to confirm its feasibility in terms of acceptability to the relevant networks.
DESIGN: We conducted a needs analysis among eight telemedicine networks delivering humanitarian services. A small proportion of consultations (5-10\%) suggested that networks may experience difficulties in finding the right specialists from within their own resources. With the assistance of key stakeholders, many of whom were network coordinators, various methods of implementing a clearing house were considered. One simple solution is to establish a central database holding information about consultants who have agreed to provide help to other networks; this database could be made available to network coordinators who need a specialist when none was available in their own network.
RESULTS: The proposed solution was examined in a desktop simulation exercise, which confirmed its feasibility and probable value.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis informs full-scale implementation of a clearing house, and an associated examination of its costs and benefits.},

There were clear differences in the patterns of activity, with some networks managing an increasing caseload, and others managing a slowly reducing caseload. The seven networks had published a total of 44 papers listed in Medline which summarized the evidence resulting from the delivery of services by telemedicine. There was a dearth of information about clinical and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, the services were widely appreciated by referring doctors, considered to be clinically useful, and there were indications that clinical outcomes for telemedicine patients were often improved. Despite a lack of formal evidence, the present study suggests that telemedicine can provide clinically useful services in developing countries.},

The CT organization provides a no-cost template to allow groups to start a network without delay, together with a peer-support environment for those operating the networks. A new group needs only to supply a Guarantor (who accepts responsibility for the work of the network) and a Coordinator (who operates the telemedicine network, allocating cases and ensuring that they are responded to). Communication takes place via secure messaging, which has several advantages over plain email, e.g. all the data are stored centrally, which means that they can be read from a hand-held device such as a smart phone, but do not need to be stored on that device. Users can access the system with a standard web browser. In the first three months, seven networks were established on the CT system by university groups in the US, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, and by a large, multinational humanitarian organisation. In the most active network, there were 86 telemedicine cases in the first three months, i.e. an average submission rate of 7 cases/week. The CT system appears to fulfil its aim of assisting doctors who wish to help colleagues in other countries by improving their access to specialist opinions, while allowing them to maintain control over the new network's use and development. The long term aim of the CT organization is to provide a means of improving the quality of health care at the point of delivery in low resource settings.},

	abstract = {Despite the increasing use of telemedicine around the world, little has been done to incorporate quality assurance (QA) into these operations. The purpose of the present study was to examine the feasibility of QA in store-and-forward teleconsulting using a previously published framework. During a 2-year study period, we examined the feasibility of using QA tools in two mature telemedicine networks [Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and New Zealand Teledermatology (NZT)]. The tools included performance reporting to assess trends, automated follow-up of patients to obtain outcomes data, automated surveying of referrers to obtain user feedback, and retrospective assessment of randomly selected cases to assess quality. In addition, the senior case coordinators in each network were responsible for identifying potential adverse events from email reports received from users. During the study period, there were 149 responses to the patient follow-up questions relating to the 1241 MSF cases (i.e., 12\% of cases), and there were 271 responses to the follow-up questions relating to the 639 NZT cases (i.e., 42\% of cases). The collection of user feedback reports was combined with the collection of patient follow-up data, thus producing the same response rates. The outcomes data suggested that the telemedicine advice proved useful for the referring doctor in the majority of cases and was likely to benefit the patient. The user feedback was overwhelmingly positive, over 90\% of referrers in the two networks finding the advice received to be of educational benefit. The feedback also suggested that the teleconsultation had provided cost savings in about 20\% of cases, either to the patient/family, or to the hospital/clinic treating the patient. Various problems were detected by regular monitoring, and certain adverse events were identified from email reports by the users. A single aberrant quality reading was detected by using a process control chart. The present study demonstrates that a QA program is feasible in store-and-forward telemedicine, and shows that it was useful in two different networks, because certain problems were detected (and then solved) that would not have been identified until much later. It seems likely that QA could be used much more widely in telemedicine generally to benefit patient care.},

	abstract = {Introduction In cystic fibrosis, exacerbations impair lung function and health-related quality of life, increase healthcare costs and reduce survival. Delayed reporting of worsening symptoms can result in more severe exacerbations and worse clinical outcomes; therefore there is a need for a novel approach to facilitate the early identification and treatment of exacerbations in this population. This study investigated the usability of a smartphone application to report symptoms in adults with cystic fibrosis, and the observer agreement in clinical decision-making between senior clinicians interpreting smartphone application responses. Methods Adults with cystic fibrosis used the smartphone application weekly for four weeks. The application comprised 10 yes/no questions regarding respiratory symptoms and two regarding emotional well-being. Usability was measured with the System Usability Scale; Observer agreement was tested by providing a cystic fibrosis physician and a nurse practitioner with 45 clinical scenarios. For each scenario the clinicians, who were blinded to each other's responses, were asked to indicate whether or not they would: (i) initiate telephone contact, and/or (ii) request a clinic visit for the individual. Results Ten participants (five female), aged mean (SD) 33 (11) years, FEV1 49 (27)\% predicted completed the study. The mean (SD) System Usability Scale score was 94 (6). There was perfect agreement between clinicians for initiating contact with the participant ( κ = 1.0, p {\textless} 0.001), and near-perfect for requesting a clinic visit ( κ = 0.86, p {\textless} 0.001). Discussion The use of a smartphone application for reporting symptoms in adults with cystic fibrosis has excellent usability and near-perfect agreement between senior clinicians when interpreting the application responses.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the perceived utility and demand for the application of telemedicine for improved patient care between nonsurgical dental practitioners (GPs) and oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two distinct questionnaires were made, one for GPs and one for OMSs. The GP questionnaire was sent to practicing Virginia Dental Association members on an e-mail list (approximately 2,200). The OMS questionnaire was sent by the Virginia Society of Oral Maxillofacial Surgery to members on an e-mail list (approximately 213). Questionnaires included questions about access to care, benefits of telemedicine consultations, reliability of telemedicine consultations, and perceived barriers against and opportunities for the implementation of telemedicine. The questionnaire was completed by 226 GP and 41 OMS respondents.
RESULTS: There was a significant difference among responses of GPs based on practice location: rural patients had a longer average time from referral to OMS consultation (P = .003), rural patients traveled longer distances (P {\textless} .0001), rural practitioners referred more patients (P = .0038), and rural GPs referred more single-tooth implant cases (P = .0039). GP respondents moderately agreed to statements about the benefits of telemedicine, whereas OMS respondents were more neutral. GPs responded they would refer more patients (4.4) if consultations could be performed by telemedicine. OMSs agreed that more referrals would influence their decision to provide telemedicine consultations (51\%). Practitioners had neutral perceptions about the reliability of telemedicine. OMS respondents agreed they would implement telemedicine in their practice if it provided equally good consultations as in-office visits.
CONCLUSION: According to the present findings, telemedicine could be an important step in the right direction for overcoming current issues with patient access to care and increasing health care costs. The benefits of telemedicine technology have been documented and will continue to be seen with wider application of its use in other areas of health care such as oral and maxillofacial surgery.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 335 patients over a 6-year period was performed to evaluate success rates of telemedicine consultations in adequately assessing patients for surgical treatment under anesthesia. Success or failure of the telemedicine consultation was measured by the ability to triage patients appropriately for the hospital operating room versus the clinic, to provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan, and to provide a sufficient medical and physical assessment for planned anesthesia. Data gathered from the average distance traveled and data from a previous telemedicine study performed by the National Institute of Justice were used to estimate the cost savings of using telemedicine consultations over the 6-year period.
RESULTS: Practitioners performing the consultation were successful 92.2\% of the time in using the data collected to make a diagnosis and treatment plan. Patients were triaged correctly 99.6\% of the time for the clinic or hospital operating room. Most patients (98.0\%) were given sufficient medical and physical assessment and were able to undergo surgery with anesthesia as planned at the clinic appointment immediately after telemedicine consultation. Most patients (95.9\%) were given an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. The estimated amount saved by providing consultation by telemedicine and eliminating in-office consultation was substantial at \$134,640.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms the findings from previous studies that telemedicine consultations are as reliable as those performed by traditional methods.},

	abstract = {Background Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective tool to prevent HIV infection for at-risk individuals, but access requires medical providers to be aware of and comfortable with prescribing PrEP. Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) was started to support hepatitis C virus treatment in rural New Mexico, but has since expanded to train health practitioners to treat other medical conditions in other locations.
METHODS: In 2012, a Project ECHO telehealth program was launched to mentor community HIV practitioners in our region. In July 2015, quarterly PrEP didactics and monthly PrEP case discussions were incorporated into this program. The result was a pilot PrEP telementoring intervention. An initial nine-question survey assessed baseline community practitioner knowledge and attitudes towards PrEP, and a follow-up 16-item survey 2 years later assessed the effect of Project ECHO on PrEP knowledge, concerns and prescribing practices.
RESULTS: Twenty-four and 45 medical providers completed the baseline and follow-up surveys respectively. In follow-up, providers reported that Project ECHO participation helped them stay current on PrEP guidelines, improved knowledge, increased likelihood to prescribe PrEP and addressed most concerns about prescribing PrEP. One exception was continued concerns about cost and insurance access, which were addressed by adjusting the didactic curriculum. Many participants reported that the Project ECHO pilot PrEP telementoring intervention assisted them in disseminating PrEP knowledge to other medical providers in their region.
CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to incorporate PrEP training into Project ECHO distance telementoring programs as a tool to educate community practitioners and support PrEP prescribing.},

	abstract = {Medical physics is a relatively small professional community, usually with a scarcity of expertise that could greatly benefit students entering the field. However, the reach of the profession can span great geographical distances, making the training of students a difficult task. In addition to the requirement of training new students, the evolving field of medical physics, with its many emerging advanced techniques and technologies, could benefit greatly from ongoing continuing education as well as consultation with experts.Many continuing education courses and workshops are constantly being offered, including many web-based study courses and virtual libraries. However, one mode of education and communication that has not been widely used is the real-time interactive process. Video-based conferencing systems do exist, but these usually require a substantial amount of effort and cost to set up.The authors have been working on promoting the ever-expanding capability of the Internet to facilitate the education of medical physics to students entering the field. A pilot project has been carried out for six years and reported previously. The project is a collaboration between the Department of Medical Physics at the Toronto Odette Cancer Centre in Canada and the Department of Biomedical Imaging at the University of Malaya in Malaysia. Since 2001, medical physics graduate students at the University of Malaya have been taught by lecturers from Toronto every year, using the Internet as the main tool of communication.The pilot study explored the different methods that can be used to provide real-time interactive remote education, and delivered traditional classroom lectures as well as hands-on workshops.Another similar project was started in 2007 to offer real-time teaching to a class of medical physics students at Wuhan University in Hubei, China. There are new challenges as well as new opportunities associated with this project. By building an inventory of tools and experiences, the intent is to broaden the real-time teleteaching method to serve a wide community so that future students entering the field can have efficient access to high-quality education that will benefit the profession in the long term.},

	abstract = {Telehealth is a way to provide health-care services to a patient from a provider who is at another location. The most common methods include a live interactive visit with the patient, interpretation of imaging, and monitoring of patient progress. Principally, telehealth is a way of providing a service rather than a type of service. It is about patient care, not data care.Examples of orthopaedic applications include conducting patient examinations, interpreting imaging studies, and providing postoperative care. Teleconsultation has been shown to be cost-effective. Other examples in orthopaedic research include the application of telemedicine when measuring patient-reported outcomes. Especially in cases when the patient lives far away from the provider, telehealth reduces time, produces good patient satisfaction, and costs less than hands-on care. As in everyday life, consumers have learned to demand convenience, ease of use, choice, control, and direct access. The ubiquity of telecommunications, combined with consumer technology savviness, drives the demand for telehealth. Unfortunately, the nation's largest payer for health services is one of the most restrictive for telehealth coverage. Medicare's restrictions are mostly the work of the U.S. Congress under Part B law. Video visits are very narrowly covered. Another major policy barrier is that interstate telehealth requires multiple state licenses for the physician, who must be licensed in the jurisdiction of each patient as well as the provider's physical locations. As Medicare shifts toward capitated payment and other value-based methods, there are opportunities to remove such restrictions.Despite these challenges, some states have been proactive in implementing telehealth systems. Arkansas is one of these states, and being a rural state with 2 main population centers, specialty care is relatively sparse. Implemented in 2014, the hand trauma program has been a partnership between the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and the Arkansas Trauma Communications Center (ATCC). This program has been very successful in decreasing the rate of hand trauma transfer, allowing patients to be treated closer to home while having coordinated access to fellowship-trained hand surgeons when necessary.More widespread innovation of orthopaedic applications for telehealth requires physician buy-in and health-systems partnerships. The regulatory environment will need streamlining. Ultimately, consumer demand will drive the implementation of technology to make care more accessible, convenient, and cost-effective.},

	abstract = {Background: Medicare recently approved coverage of home telemonitoring for early detection of incident choroidal neovascularization (CNV) among patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but no economic evaluation has yet assessed its cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact.
Objectives: To evaluate a home-based daily visual-field monitoring system using simulation methods and to apply the findings of the Home Monitoring of the Eye study to the US population at high risk for wet-form AMD.
Design, Setting, and Participants: In this economic analysis, an evaluation of the potential cost, cost-effectiveness, and government budgetary impact of adoption of a home-based daily visual-field monitoring system among eligible Medicare patients was performed. Effectiveness and visual outcomes data from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 Home Monitoring of the Eye study, treatment data from the Wills Eye Hospital Treat \& Extend study, and AMD progression data from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 1 were used to simulate the long-term effects of telemonitoring patients with CNV in one eye or large drusen and/or pigment abnormalities in both eyes. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis and an alternative scenario using the Treat \& Extend study control group outcomes were used to examine uncertainty in these data and assumptions.
Interventions: Home telemonitoring of patients with AMD for early detection of CNV vs usual care.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, net present value of lifetime societal costs, and 10-year nominal government expenditures.
Result: Telemonitoring of patients with existing unilateral CNV or multiple bilateral risk factors for CNV (large drusen and retinal pigment abnormalities) incurs \$907 (95\% CI, -\$6302 to \$2809) in net lifetime societal costs, costs \$1312 (95\% CI, \$222-\$2848) per patient during 10 years from the federal government's perspective, and results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \$35 663 (95\% CI, cost savings to \$235 613) per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
Conclusions and Relevance: Home telemonitoring of patients with AMD who are at risk for CNV was cost-effective compared with scheduled examinations alone. Monitoring patients with existing CNV in one eye is cost saving, but monitoring is generally not cost-effective among patients with low risk of CNV, including those with no or few risk factors. With Medicare coverage, monitoring incurs budgetary expenditures for the government but is cost-saving for patients at high risk of AMD. Monitoring could be cost saving to society if monitoring reduced the frequency of scheduled examinations or led to a reduction of one or more injections of ranibizumab.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Results from the Danish cluster-randomized trial of telehealthcare to 1,225 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the Danish Telecare North Trial, concluded that the telehealthcare solution was unlikely to be cost-effective, by applying international willingness-to-pay threshold values. The purpose of this article was to assess potential sources of variation across subgroups, which could explain overall cost-effectiveness results or be utilized in future economic studies in telehealthcare research.
METHODS: First, the cost-structures and cost-effectiveness across COPD severities were analyzed. Second, five additional subgroup analyses were conducted, focusing on differences in cost-effectiveness across a set of comorbidities, age-groups, genders, resource patterns (resource use in the social care sector prior to randomization), and delivery sites. All subgroups were investigated post hoc. In analyzing cost-effectiveness, two separate linear mixed-effects models with treatment-by-covariate interactions were applied: one for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain and one for total healthcare and social sector costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used for each subgroup result in order to quantify the uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness results.
RESULTS: The study concludes that, across the COPD severities, patients with severe COPD (GOLD 3 classification) are likely to be the most cost-effective group. This is primarily due to lower hospital-admission and primary-care costs. Telehealthcare for patients younger than 60 years is also more likely to be cost-effective than for older COPD patients. Overall, results indicate that existing resource patterns of patients and variations in delivery-site practices might have a strong influence on cost-effectiveness, possibly stronger than the included health or sociodemographic sources of heterogeneity.
CONCLUSION: Future research should focus more on sources of heterogeneity found in the implementation context and the way telehealthcare is adopted (eg, by integrating formative evaluation into cost-effectiveness analyses).

DESIGN: A 12-month cost-utility analysis conducted alongside a cluster-randomised trial.
SETTING: Community-based setting in the geographical area of North Denmark Region in Denmark.
PARTICIPANTS: 26 municipality districts define randomisation clusters with 13 districts in each arm. 1225 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were enrolled, of which 578 patients were randomised to telehealthcare and 647 to usual care.
INTERVENTIONS: In addition to usual care, patients in the intervention group received a set of telehealthcare equipment and were monitored by a municipality-based healthcare team. Patients in the control group received usual care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-years gained from baseline up to 12 months follow-up.
RESULTS: From a healthcare and social sector perspective, the adjusted mean difference in total costs between telehealthcare and usual care was €728 (95\% CI -754 to 2211) and the adjusted mean difference in quality-adjusted life-years gained was 0.0132 (95\% CI -0.0083 to 0.0346). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was €55 327 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Decision-makers should be willing to pay more than €55 000 to achieve a probability of cost-effectiveness {\textgreater}50\%. This conclusion is robust to changes in the definition of hospital contacts and reduced intervention costs. Only in the most optimistic scenario combining the effects of all sensitivity analyses, does the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio fall below the UK thresholds values (€21 068 per quality-adjusted life-year).
CONCLUSIONS: Telehealthcare is unlikely to be a cost-effective addition to usual care, if it is offered to all patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and if the willingness-to-pay threshold values from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence are applied.

However, CBT is associated with significant patient dropout and lacks the means to provide objective data regarding a patient's experience and symptoms between sessions. Emerging wearables and mobile health (mHealth) applications represent an approach that may provide objective data to the patient and provider between CBT sessions. Here, we describe the development of a classifier of real-time physiological stress in a healthy population (n = 35) and apply it in a controlled clinical evaluation for armed forces veterans undergoing CBT for stress and anger management (n = 16). Using cardiovascular and electrodermal inputs from a wearable device, the classifier was able to detect physiological stress in a non-clinical sample with accuracy greater than 90\%. In a small clinical sample, patients who used the classifier and an associated mHealth application were less likely to discontinue therapy (p = 0.016, d = 1.34) and significantly improved on measures of stress (p = 0.032, d = 1.61), anxiety (p = 0.050, d = 1.26), and anger (p = 0.046, d = 1.41) compared to controls undergoing CBT alone. Given the large number of individuals that experience mental health disorders and the unmet need for treatment, especially in developing nations, such mHealth approaches have the potential to provide or augment treatment at low cost in the absence of in-person care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental health condition with substantial costs to individuals and society. Among military veterans, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD has been estimated to be as high as 20\%. Numerous research studies have demonstrated that short-term cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), lead to substantial and sustained improvements in PTSD symptoms. Despite known benefits, only a minority of clinicians provide these therapies. Transferring this research knowledge into clinical settings remains one of the largest hurdles to improving the health of veterans with PTSD. Attending a workshop alone is insufficient to promote adequate knowledge transfer and sustained skill; however, relatively little research has been conducted to identify effective post-training support strategies.
METHODS: The current study investigates whether clinicians receiving post-workshop support (six-month duration) will deliver CPT with greater fidelity (i.e., psychotherapy adherence and competence) and have improved patient outcomes compared with clinicians receiving no formal post-workshop support. The study conditions are: technology-enhanced group tele-consultation; standard group tele-consultation; and fidelity assessment with no consultation. The primary outcome is independent assessment (via audio-recordings) of the clinicians' adherence and competence in delivering CPT. The secondary outcome is observed changes in patient symptoms during and following treatment as a function of clinician fidelity. Post-consultation interviews with clinicians will help identify facilitators and barriers to psychotherapy skill acquisition. The study results will inform how best to implement and transfer evidence-based psychotherapy (e.g., CPT) to clinical settings to attain comparable outcomes to those observed in research settings.
DISCUSSION: Findings will deepen our understanding of how much and what type of support is needed following a workshop to help clinicians become proficient in delivering a new protocol. Several influences on clinician learning and patient outcomes will be discussed. An evidence-based model of clinical consultation will be developed, with the ultimate goal of informing policy and influencing best practice in clinical consultation.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Smoking is the most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in U.S. veterans. Rural veterans in particular have elevated risk for smoking and smoking-related illness. However, these veterans underutilize smoking cessation treatment, which suggests that interventions for rural veterans should optimize efficacy and reach.
OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention that combines evidenced based treatment for smoking cessation with smart-phone based, portable contingency management on smoking rates compared to a contact control intervention in a randomized controlled trial among rural Veteran smokers. Specifically, Veterans will be randomized to receive Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy (ART) which combines evidenced based cognitive-behavioral telephone counseling (TC), a tele-medicine clinic for access to nicotine replacement (NRT), and mobile contingency management (mCM) or a control condition (i.e., TC and NRT alone) that will provide controls for therapist, medication, time and attention effects.
METHODS: Smokers were identified using VHA electronic medical records and recruited proactively via telephone. Participants (N=310) are randomized to either ART or a best practice control consisting of telephone counseling and telemedicine. Participating patients will be surveyed at 3-months, 6-months and 12-months post-randomization. The primary outcome measure is self-reported and biochemically validated prolonged abstinence at 6-month follow-up.
DISCUSSION: This trial is designed to test the relative effectiveness of ART compared to a telehealth-only comparison group. Dissemination of this mHealth intervention for veterans in a variety of settings would be warranted if ART improves smoking outcomes for rural veterans and is cost-effective.},

METHODS: Telehealth-related mental health service claims were identified with private claims data from 2009 to 2013. These data-provided by the Health Care Cost Institute-included claims from Aetna, Humana, and UnitedHealth for more than 50 million individuals per year.
RESULTS: In 2009-2013, there were 13,480 MH/SA telehealth provider claims out of 3,986,159 claims, with the majority of telehealth claims submitted by psychiatrists. For telehealth services, there was a decreasing trend for average reimbursements (\$54.61 in 2009 to \$43.28 in 2013). Average reimbursements for telehealth claims were half those for nontelehealth claims. Reimbursements for nine of the top 10 telehealth services were lower in 2015 dollars than for the same services provided during face-to-face treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Widespread adoption and use of costly telehealth technologies for mental health services may be limited by low reimbursements for telehealth services.},

However, little is known about how private payer reimbursements vary between telehealth and non-telehealth services. We use the largest private claims database in the United States provided by the Health Care Cost Institute to identify telehealth claims and compare average reimbursements to non-telehealth claims. We find average reimbursements for telehealth services are significantly lower than those for non-telehealth for seven of the ten most common services. For example, telehealth reimbursements for office visits for evaluation and management of established patients with low complexity were 30\% lower than the corresponding non-telehealth service. Reimbursements by clinical diagnosis code also tended to be lower for telehealth than non-telehealth claims. Widespread adoption of telehealth may be hampered by lower reimbursements for telehealth services relative to face-to-face services. This may result in lower incentives for providers to invest in telehealth technologies that do not result in significant cost savings to their practice, even if telehealth improves patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that benefits from specialty care. Telehealth is an innovative resource that can enhance access to this care within a patient-centered framework. Research suggests that telehealth can lead to increased patient satisfaction, equal or better clinical outcomes, and cost savings, but these outcomes have not been well-studied in PD.
METHODS: We conducted a dual active-arm 12-month randomized controlled trial to assess patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, travel burden, and health care utilization in PD using video telehealth for follow-up care with specialty providers. Telehealth visits took place either at a facility nearer to the patient (satellite clinic arm) or in the patient's home (home arm). Each control group received usual in-person care. Patient satisfaction, assessed by quantitative questionnaires, was the primary outcome.
RESULTS: Eighty-six men were enrolled (home arm: 18 active, 18 control; satellite clinic arm: 26 active, 24 control) with a mean age of 73 years (range 42-87). There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the active group and the controls in each arm (p {\textgreater} 0.05). A significant difference in overall patient satisfaction was not found; however, high levels of patient satisfaction were found in all groups. Greater satisfaction for the telehealth modality was found in assessments of convenience and accessibility/distance. Clinical outcomes were similar between groups, travel burden was reduced using telehealth, and health care utilization was largely similar in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: As the need for PD subspecialty care increases, innovative patient-centered solutions to overcoming barriers to access, such as video telehealth, will be invaluable to patients and may provide high patient satisfaction.},

A retrospective review was conducted on referrals from August 2016 to July 2017 at three regional Burn Centers that utilize the same mobile phone app. Centers studied are located in the Western, Northeastern, and Southern regions of the United States. Data on numbers of admissions, consults, referral facilities, type of wounds, disposition, and distance from the Burn Centers were recorded. A total of 2011 consults were placed using the mobile phone app from 294 different referring facilities spanning seven states. Utilization of the mobile phone app ranged from 20.4\% to 84\% among centers. All three centers demonstrated a similar range of consult distances (0-289 miles). Overall, the top three referral diagnoses were scald, contact, and flame burns. Regional differences included a higher percentage of frostbite in the Western region (P {\textless} 0.001) and a higher percentage of scald burns in the Northeastern and Southern regions (P {\textless} 0.001). The majority of patients at all centers were referred to outpatient clinics for ongoing burn care.

Telemedicine that incorporates a visual component can provide immediate expertise in the treatment and management of these injuries. The authors sought to evaluate the addition of video telemedicine to our current telephone burn transfer program. During a 2-year period, 282 patients, 59.4\% of all burn patients transferred from outside hospitals, were enrolled in the study. In addition to the scripted call with the charge nurse (ChargeRN) and the accepting physician, nine hospitals also transmitted video images of the wounds before transfer as part of a store and forward telemedicine transfer program (77, 27.6\%). The accuracy of burn size estimations (BSA burned) and management changes (fluid requirements, transfer mode, and final disposition) were analyzed between the telephones-only sites (T only) and the video-enhanced sites. Referringstaff participating in video-enhanced telemedicine were sent a Google survey assessing their experience the following day. The referring staff (Referringstaff) was correct in their burn assessment 20\% of the time. Video assessment improved the ChargeRN BSA burned and resulted in more accurate fluid resuscitation (P = .030), changes in both transportation mode (P = .042), and disposition decisions (P = .20). The majority of the Referringstaff found that video-enhanced telemedicine helped them communicate with the burn staff more effectively (3.4 ± 0.37, scale 1-4). This study reports the successful implementation of video-enhanced telemedicine pilot project in a rural state. Video-enhanced telemedicine using a store and forward process improved burn size estimation and facilitated management changes. Although not quantitatively assessed, the low cost of the system coupled with the changes in transportation and disposition strongly suggests a decrease in healthcare costs associated with the addition of video to a telephone-only transfer program.},

METHODS: A pilot project began in August 2011 with the Indianapolis VA Medical Center (VAMC) and the Health Resource Center (HRC) in Topeka, Kansas. The Indianapolis VAMC used a first-call resolution business model consisting of pharmacy technicians receiving tier 1 phone calls that could be escalated to a tier 2 line that consisted of lead technicians and pharmacists, while the HRC utilized general telephone agents that would transfer unresolved calls to the primary facility. Pre- and post-VISN 11 Pharmacy Call Center performance metrics were compared for each of the 7 facilities in the network with the goals being monthly average abandoned call rate less than 5\% and average speed to answer less than 30 seconds. Cost per call was also compared.
RESULTS: The average abandoned call rate for the network during the year prior to VISN 11 Pharmacy Call Center implementation (August 2010-July 2011) was 15.66\% and decreased to 3\% in July 2014. The average abandoned call rate decreased for each individual facility. In fiscal year 2014, the VISN 11 Pharmacy Call Center was operating at a cost of \$4.35 per call while providing more services than the HRC, resulting in less workload being transferred back to the individual facilities.
CONCLUSION: A centralized VISN pharmacy call center is a reasonable alternative to individual facility call centers or the HRC.},

ACCESS also has an education component in which hospitals receive training from stroke specialists on the triage and treatment of patients. This study assessed the clinical and economic outcomes of the ACCESS program in providing services to rural New Mexico from a healthcare payer perspective.
METHODS: A decision tree model was constructed using findings from the ACCESS program and existing literature, the likelihood that a patient will receive a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), cost of care, and resulting quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Data from the ACCESS program includes emergency room patients in rural New Mexico from May 2015 to August 2016. Outcomes and costs have been estimated for patients who were taken to a hospital providing neurological telecare and patients who were not.
RESULTS: The use of ACCESS decreased neuro-emergent stroke patient transfers from rural hospitals to urban settings from 85\% to 5\% (no tPA) and 90\% to 23\% (tPA), while stroke specialist reading of patient CT/MRI imaging within 3 h of onset of stroke symptoms increased from 2\% to 22\%. Results indicate that use of ACCESS has the potential to save \$4,241 (\$3,952-\$4,438) per patient and increase QALYs by 0.20 (0.14-0.22). This increase in QALYs equates to ∼73 more days of life at full health. The cost savings and QALYs are expected to increase when moving from a 90-day model to a lifetime model.
CONCLUSION: The analysis demonstrates potential savings and improved quality-of-life associated with the use of ACCESS for patients presenting to rural hospitals with acute ischemic stroke (AIS).},

In recent years, e-mental health interventions using clinical video teleconferencing, Internet-based interventions, social networking sites, and telephones have emerged as viable, cost-effective methods to augment traditional service delivery. Whereas some research evaluates attitudes about e-mental health, few studies have assessed interest in using these approaches in a contemporary sample of U.S. Veterans. This study sought to understand willingness to use e-mental health in a diverse group of Veterans residing in Hawaii. Mailed surveys were completed by 600 Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom Veterans and National Guard members. Results suggest that overall willingness to use e-mental health ranged from 32.2\% to 56.7\% depending on modality type. Importantly, Veterans who screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were significantly less likely to report willingness to use each e-mental health modality than their peers without PTSD, despite their greater desire for mental health services. These results suggest that despite solutions to logistical barriers afforded via e-mental health services, certain barriers to mental health care may persist, especially among Veterans who screen positive for PTSD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Dutch government, hospitals, and health insurance companies have agreed on concentrating all specialist care in a few expert centers. This should lead to lower healthcare costs, but might also cause less accessible healthcare for patients living at a considerable distance from expert centers. A way to overcome less accessible healthcare, while maintaining reduced costs of medical care, is by using telemedicine between physician and patient.
METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, follow-up consultation between the patient and physician via a secured real-time video connection 6 weeks after plastic surgery of the face was compared to traditional in-person consultation after the same time interval. After the consultation, patients received an invite to fill in an online survey, which consisted of questionnaires assessing patient satisfaction (PSQ-18, TSQ) and communication experiences (PEQ), as well as questions about the time spent on different aspects of the consultations.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients participated. Overall satisfaction was equal for both groups, but a significant difference in the dimensions 'general satisfaction' (online consultation group more satisfied) and 'accessibility and convenience' (online consultation group less satisfied) was found. Patients reported significantly lower satisfaction in patient-physician communication in online consultation than in traditional in-person consultations. Patients were satisfied with the online consultation, and were willing to use the system again. Patients in the online consultation group experienced significantly less waiting time, and spent less time in total for the appointment.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall patients are equally satisfied with traditional consultation or real-time video consultation in plastic surgery. Online consultation is found to be a time-saving alternative to traditional consultation. However, online consultation is perceived by some patients as a negative influence on communication with the physician. Dedicated training for physicians in the use of online consultation is recommended to improve their online communicative skills.

	abstract = {Telemedicine and telehealth programs are inherently complex compared with their traditional on-site health care delivery counterparts. Relatively few organizations have developed sustainable, multi-specialty telemedicine programs, although single service programs, such as teleradiology and telepsychiatry programs, are common. A number of factors are barriers to the development of sustainable telemedicine and telehealth programs. First, starting programs is often challenging since relatively few organizations have, in house, a critical mass of individuals with the skill sets required to organize and manage a telemedicine program. Therefore, it is necessary to "boot strap" many of the start-up activities using available personnel. Another challenge is to assemble a management team that has time to champion telemedicine and telehealth while dealing with the broad range of issues that often confront telemedicine programs. Telemedicine programs housed within a single health care delivery system have advantages over programs that serve as umbrella telehealth organizations for multiple health care systems. Planning a telemedicine program can involve developing a shared vision among the participants, including the parent organizations, management, customers and the public. Developing shared visions can be a time-consuming, iterative process. Part of planning includes having the partnering organizations and their management teams reach a consensus on the initial program goals, priorities, strategies, and implementation plans. Staffing requirements of telemedicine and telehealth programs may be met by sharing existent resources, hiring additional personnel, or outsourcing activities. Business models, such as the Application Service Provider (ASP) model used by the Arizona Telemedicine Program, are designed to provide staffing flexibility by offering a combination of in-house and out-sourced services, depending on the needs of the individual participating health care organizations. Telemedicine programs should perform ongoing assessments of activities, ranging from service usage to quality of service assessments, to ongoing analyses of financial performance. The financial assessments should include evaluations of costs and benefits, coding issues, reimbursement, account receivables, bad debt and network utilization. Long-range strategic planning for a telemedicine and telehealth program should be carried out on an on-going basis and should include the program's governing board. This planning process should include goal setting and the periodic updating of the program's vision and mission statements. There can be additional special issues for multi-organization telemedicine and telehealth programs. For example, authority management can require the use of innovative approaches tailored to the realities of the organizational structures of the participating members. Inter-institutional relations may introduce additional issues when competing health care organizations are utilizing shared resources. Branding issues are preferably addressed during the initial planning of a multi-organizational telemedicine and telehealth program. Ideally, public policy regarding telemedicine and telehealth within a service region will complement the objectives of telemedicine and telehealth programs within that service area.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The role of physicians often extends beyond provision of direct patient care and includes appearance in courts as professional or expert witnesses to give their testimony in various legal cases. This often consumes precious time and resources of the doctors and the hospitals. This study was taken up to evaluate the present system of the physical appearance of the doctors to various courts and compare it with the videoconferencing mode of giving testimony (tele-evidence).
Materials and Methods: Available records of summons and vehicles used were analyzed to calculate the cost involved and man-hours consumed in honoring the court summons. Telemedicine facility, available in our institute, was used for conducting tele-evidence with selected courts of the two states as a pilot, which was later expanded. A survey was also done to assess the experience of the physicians with physical appearance and videoconferencing using structured questionnaire after approval from the Institute's Ethics Committee. Likert scale of 0-10 points was used to measure satisfaction.
Results: There was 43\% drop in the monthly mileage of vehicles, 49\% reduction in the fuel cost per month, and 28\% savings in terms of time consumed for court duties. Satisfaction score for parameters of time consumed, physical strain, mental strain, communication with Honorable Judges, and overall experience was 87\% through tele-evidence as compared to 31\% with physical appearance.
Conclusion: Tele-evidence is an acceptable and implementable mode of testifying and has led to tremendous resource savings in our tertiary care setting. The model needs to be replicated for deliverance of justice and is in consonance with Government's push toward Digital India.},

METHODS: A cohort of 16 patients with Parkinson's disease residing at one of 2 locations of a multi-facility continuous care retirement organization were seen virtually in follow-up over a 3-year period by Telehealth Services at a large, academic, tertiary care hospital in southeastern Pennsylvania. The data collected during that period, studied retrospectively, included demographic information, number of telehealth visits, and UPDRS scores obtained at each visit. Satisfaction and potential cost savings were also reviewed.
RESULTS: UPDRS scores declined over the period of observation, from a range of 18-60 at study start to 28-72 at study end. Actual cost savings are difficult to define; however, the cost per telehealth visit at \$117.30 was often lower than the facility's average cost for transporting patients to a visit in the neurologist's office. Patients, families, subspecialists, and the nursing staff expressed uniformly high satisfaction with telehealth.
CONCLUSION: This model for providing care proved to be sustainable and efficient, and promoted collaboration among the providers at the long-term care facility and those at the remote site. These benefits may be applicable to patients with degenerative disorders in similar settings.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although teledermatology offers promise as a tool to increase access to care, adoption has been limited. Understanding the perspectives and experiences of key stakeholders, such as primary care providers (PCPs) and patients, is important to identify opportunities to reduce barriers to adoption and to improve teledermatology programs. Although many studies have examined patients' experiences and satisfaction with teledermatology, few have examined referring PCPs' perspectives.
OBJECTIVE: To identify PCPs' perceptions on the strengths and limitations of teledermatology in order to identify opportunities to improve teledermatology programs.
METHODS: We distributed an anonymous, web-based survey to 30 PCPs involved in a two-year study evaluating a mobile app-based teledermatology platform.
RESULTS: 100\% (18/18) agreed or strongly agreed that teledermatology increases access to dermatologic care, improves patient care, and is acceptable to patients. 100\% (18/18) agreed or strongly agreed that teledermatology provides educational benefit to the PCP. Only 6\% (1/18) agreed that teledermatology increases medical liability and 11\% (2/18) agreed that it increases risk of a breach in privacy or confidentiality.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that PCPs are highly satisfied with mobile app-based, store-and-forward teledermatology and that they believe teledermatology offers synergistic educational benefit. We hope these results will help guide the development of teledermatology programs to increase access to timely, cost-effective care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Telestroke systems are tools, used to provide an advanced stroke care in regions without sufficient neurologic services. We performed this meta-analysis to assess the effects of telemedicine on treatment times and clinical outcomes of acute stroke care.
METHODS: A literature search of PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane CENTRAL was conducted for original studies investigating telemedicine applications in acute stroke care. Dichotomous data on treatment outcomes were pooled as odds ratios (ORs), while continuous data on thrombolysis times were pooled as mean differences (MDs) with 95\% confidence interval (CI), using RevMan software (version 5.3).
RESULTS: Pooling data from 26 studies (6605 thrombolysed patients) showed no significant differences between the telestroke and control groups in terms of in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.21, 95\% CI [0.98, 1.49]), 90-day mortality (OR = 1.08, 95\% CI [0.85, 1.37]), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) (OR = 1.10, 95\% CI [0.79, 1.53]), and favorable clinical outcome at discharge (OR = 1.03, 95\% CI [0.69, 1.53]) and 90 days later (OR = 0.99, 95\% CI [0.82, 1.18]). The onset-to-door (OTD) duration (MD = -10.4 minutes, 95\% CI [-14.79, -.01]) and length of hospital stay (MD = -0.55 days, 95\% CI [-1.02, -0.07]) were significantly shorter in the telestroke group, compared to the control group. Although the overall effect estimate (under the fixed-effect model) showed a significant decrease in the onset-to-treatment (OTT) duration in the telestroke group (MD = -5.83 minutes, 95\% CI [-8.57, -3.09]), employing the random-effects model for between-study heterogeneity abolished this significance (MD = -5.90 minutes, 95\% CI [-13.23, 1.42]).
CONCLUSION: Telestroke significantly reduced OTD and hospital stay durations in stroke patients without increasing the risk of mortality or sICH. Therefore, telemedicine can improve stroke care in regional areas with minor experience in thrombolysis. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the benefits of telestroke systems, especially in terms of cost-effectiveness and quality of life outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The demand for care is increasing, whereas in the near future the number of people working in professional care will not match with the demand for care. eHealth technology can help to meet the growing demand for care. Despite the apparent positive effects of eHealth technology, there are still barriers to technology adoption related to the absence of a composite set of knowledge and skills among health care professionals regarding the use of eHealth technology.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to discuss the competencies required by health care professionals working in home care, with eHealth technologies such as remote telecare and ambient assisted living (AAL), mobile health, and fall detection systems.
METHODS: A two-day collaborative workshop was undertaken with academics across multiple disciplines with experience in working on funded research regarding the application and development of technologies to support older people.
RESULTS: The findings revealed that health care professionals working in home care require a subset of composite skills as well as technology-specific competencies to develop the necessary aptitude in eHealth care. This paper argues that eHealth care technology skills must be instilled in health care professionals to ensure that technologies become integral components of future care delivery, especially to support older adults to age in place. Educating health care professionals with the necessary skill training in eHealth care will improve service delivery and optimise the eHealth care potential to reduce costs by improving efficiency. Moreover, embedding eHealth care competencies within training and education for health care professionals ensures that the benefits of new technologies are realized by casting them in the context of the larger system of care. These care improvements will potentially support the independent living of older persons at home.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper describes the health care professionals' competencies and requirements needed for the use of eHealth technologies to support elderly adults to age in place. In addition, this paper underscores the need for further discussion of the changing role of health care professionals working in home care within the context of emerging eHealth care technologies. The findings are of value to local and central government, health care professionals, service delivery organizations, and commissioners of care to use this paper as a framework to conduct and develop competencies for health care professionals working with eHealth technologies.},

The team also conducted interviews with the nodal officers, data entry operator and other relevant people at these centres. Of the six specialist nodes, four were functional and two were non-functional. Of 10 patient nodes, two nodes were functional, four were semi-functional and four were non-functional. Most of the centres were not working due to a problem with their satellite modem. The overall condition of ISRO run telemedicine centres in Madhya Pradesh was found to be poor. Most of these centres failed to provide telemedicine consultations. We recommend replacing this system with another cost effective system available in the state wide area network (SWAN). We suggest the concept of the virtual out-patient department.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: eHealth interventions appear and change so quickly that they challenge the way we conduct research. By the time a randomized trial of a new intervention is published, technological improvements and clinical discoveries may make the intervention dated and unappealing. This and the spate of health-related apps and websites may lead consumers, patients, and caregivers to use interventions that lack evidence of efficacy.
OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to offer strategies for increasing the speed and usefulness of eHealth research.
METHODS: The paper describes two types of strategies based on the authors' own research and the research literature: those that improve the efficiency of eHealth research, and those that improve its quality.
RESULTS: Efficiency strategies include: (1) think small: conduct small studies that can target discrete but significant questions and thereby speed knowledge acquisition; (2) use efficient designs: use such methods as fractional-factorial and quasi-experimental designs and surrogate endpoints, and experimentally modify and evaluate interventions and delivery systems already in use; (3) study universals: focus on timeless behavioral, psychological, and cognitive principles and systems; (4) anticipate the next big thing: listen to voices outside normal practice and connect different perspectives for new insights; (5) improve information delivery systems: researchers should apply their communications expertise to enhance inter-researcher communication, which could synergistically accelerate progress and capitalize upon the availability of "big data"; and (6) develop models, including mediators and moderators: valid models are remarkably generative, and tests of moderation and mediation should elucidate boundary conditions of effects and treatment mechanisms. Quality strategies include: (1) continuous quality improvement: researchers need to borrow engineering practices such as the continuous enhancement of interventions to incorporate clinical and technological progress; (2) help consumers identify quality: consumers, clinicians, and others all need to easily identify quality, suggesting the need to efficiently and publicly index intervention quality; (3) reduce the costs of care: concern with health care costs can drive intervention adoption and use and lead to novel intervention effects (eg, reduced falls in the elderly); and (4) deeply understand users: a rigorous evaluation of the consumer's needs is a key starting point for intervention development.
CONCLUSIONS: The challenges of distinguishing and distributing scientifically validated interventions are formidable. The strategies described are meant to spur discussion and further thinking, which are important, given the potential of eHealth interventions to help patients and families.},

DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study.
SETTING: Northwest United States.
PARTICIPANTS: High-cost Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries (N = 1,767) enrolled in two Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services demonstration participating clinics and a propensity-score matched control group.
INTERVENTION: The Health Buddy Program, which integrates a content-driven telehealth system with care management.
MEASUREMENTS: Mortality, inpatient admissions, hospital days, and emergency department (ED) visits during the 2-year study period were measured. Cox-proportional hazard models and negative binomial regression models were used to assess the relationship between the intervention and survival and utilization, controlling for demographic and health characteristics that were statistically different between groups after matching.
RESULTS: At 2 years, participants offered the Health Buddy Program had 15\% lower risk-adjusted all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.85, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.74-0.98; P = .03) and had reductions in the number of quarterly inpatient admissions from baseline to the study period that were 18\% greater than those of matched controls during this same time period (-0.035 vs -0.003; difference-in-differences = -0.032, 95\% CI = -0.054 to -0.010, P = .005). No relationship was found between the Health Buddy Program and ED use or number of hospital days for participants who were hospitalized. The Health Buddy Program was most strongly associated with fewer admissions for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mortality for those with congestive heart failure.
CONCLUSION: Care management coupled with content-driven telehealth technology has potential to improve health outcomes in high-cost Medicare beneficiaries.},

	abstract = {Health monitoring systems have rapidly evolved during the past two decades and have the potential to change the way healthcare is currently delivered. Smart monitoring systems automate patient monitoring tasks and thereby improve patient workflow management. Moreover, expert systems have the potential to assist clinicians and improve their performance by accurately executing repetitive tasks, to which humans are ill-suited. Clinicians working in hospital wards are responsible for conducting a multitude of tasks which require constant vigilance, and thus the need for a smart decision support system has arisen. In particular, wireless patient monitoring systems are emerging as a low cost, reliable and accurate means of healthcare delivery. Vital signs monitoring systems are rapidly becoming part of today's healthcare delivery. The paradigm has shifted from traditional and manual recording to computer-based electronic records and, further, to handheld devices as versatile and innovative healthcare monitoring systems. The current study focuses on interpreting multiple physical signs and early warning for hospitalized older adults so that severe consequences can be minimized. Data from a total of 30 patients have been collated in New Zealand hospitals under local and national ethics approvals. The system records blood pressure, heart rate (pulse), oxygen saturation (SpO2), ear temperature and blood glucose levels from hospitalized patients and transfers this information to a web-based software application for remote monitoring and further interpretation. Ultimately, this system is aimed to achieve a high level of agreement with clinicians' interpretation when assessing specific physical signs such as bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, hypoxaemia, fever and hypothermia to generate early warnings. The performance of the vital signs interpretation system was validated through off-line as well as real-time tests with a high level of agreement between the system and physician.},

METHODS: We constructed a randomized parallel group study of suitable patients attending our Epilepsy Clinic and compared telephonic review with conventional clinic visit based management. Primary outcomes were the percentage of patients with breakthrough seizures and total number of breakthrough seizures. We also compared cost, patient satisfaction and numbers defaulting.
RESULTS: A total of 465 patients were randomized and 429 were included in the final analysis. There was no significant difference in breakthrough seizures between the two groups. Mean time spent in the consultation was 10min in the telephone group (FT) and 22h in the face-to-face group (FC) and cost was INR 865 more expensive on an average in the FC group. Satisfaction was over 90\% in the FT group. Significantly more people in the FC group were lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This study provides Class I evidence that the number of stable epilepsy patients who have breakthrough seizures and the total number of breakthrough seizures remain the same irrespective of whether patients are reviewed telephonically or face-to-face in the clinic. Clinicians managing epilepsy patients should consider using telephonic review for selected patients. Telephonic reviews have the potential of effectively reducing the secondary treatment gap in millions of patients who do not have easy access to doctors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of telehealth on 1) the diagnosis, and management in obstetrics and cardiology, 2) health care costs from patients' perspectives, 3) attendance at health centres located in remote areas of Mali.
METHODS: The impact of telehealth on health care utilization, quality, and costs was assessed using a five-point Likert-scale based questionnaire consisting of three dimensions. It was completed by health care professionals in four district hospitals. The role of telehealth on attendance at health centres was also assessed based on data collected from the consultations logs before and during the project, between project sites and control sites. Referrals specific to the activities of the research study were also evaluated using a questionnaire to measure the real share of telehealth tools in increasing attendance at project sites. Finally, the cost savings achieved was estimated using the transport and lodging costs incurred if patients were to travel to the capital city for the same tests or care.
RESULTS: The telehealth activities contributed to improving medical diagnoses in cardiology and obstetrics (92.6\%) and the patients' management system on site (96.2\%). The attendance records at health centres increased from 8 to 35\% at all project sites during the study period. Patients from project sites saved an average of 12380 XOF (CFA Francs) or 25 USD (American dollar) and a maximum of 35000 XOF or 70 USD compared to patients from neighbouring sites, who must go to the capital city to receive the same care.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that in Mali, enhanced training in ultrasound / electrocardiography and the introduction of telehealth have improved the health system in remote areas and resulted in high levels of appropriate diagnosis and patient management in the areas of obstetrics and cardiology. Telehealth can also significantly reduce the cost to the patient.},

However, many schemes are vulnerable to various attacks, and are neither efficient, nor user friendly. Specially, in terms of efficiency, some schemes are resulting in high time cost. In this paper we propose a new authentication scheme that is using the precomputing to avoid the time-consuming exponential computations.

A total of 18 key informant interviews were conducted with direct care staff, administrative staff, and information technology professionals. Summative interview narratives were thematically coded by hand. Results indicate that direct care and administrative staff were found to be interested in the following benefits of telehealth services: increased care, decreased patient travel, decreased organizational costs, and meeting a perceived patient preference. The fulfillment of these interests, coordination, adequate staffing, accessibility of equipment, and clinician competency all contributed to the use of telehealth services. Numerous adaptations to barriers were found involving coordination, personal oversight, acceptance of limitations, education, staffing, billing for services, consultation, modifying referrals patterns, and creating treatment alternatives. Information technology professionals identified communication and assistance, testing connections, resolving initial issues, maintenance, and vision and control as vital factors. Findings may aid programs in dealing with pragmatic issues to maintain organizational readiness.},

In addition, hospitals, physician groups, and patients are demanding rapid access for the highest level of expertise in the care of critically ill patients. Telemedicine in the ICU combined with remote patient monitoring has been increasingly touted as a model of care to increase efficiencies and quality of care. Telemedicine in the ICU provides the potential to connect critically ill patients to sophisticated specialty care on a 24/7 basis, even for those hospitalized in rural locations where access to timely specialty consultations are uncommon. Research on the use of telemedicine in the ICU has suggested improved outcomes, such as reductions in mortality, reductions in length of stay, and greater adherence to evidence-based guidelines. Although the clinical footprint of telemedicine in ICU has grown over the past 20 years, there has been a relative slowing of implementation. This review examines the clinical evidence supporting the use of telemedicine in the ICU and discusses the impact on clinical efficacy and costs of care. Additionally, we review the current hurdles to more rapid adoption, including the significant financial investment, different models of care affecting the return on investment, and the varied cultural attitudes that impact the success and acceptance of care models using telemedicine in the ICU.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyper- and hypokalemia are clinically silent, common in patients with renal or cardiac disease, and are life threatening. A noninvasive, unobtrusive, blood-free method for tracking potassium would be an important clinical advance.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Two groups of hemodialysis patients (development group, n=26; validation group, n=19) underwent high-resolution digital ECG recordings and had 2 to 3 blood tests during dialysis. Using advanced signal processing, we developed a personalized regression model for each patient to noninvasively calculate potassium values during the second and third dialysis sessions using only the processed single-channel ECG. In addition, by analyzing the entire development group's first-visit data, we created a global model for all patients that was validated against subsequent sessions in the development group and in a separate validation group. This global model sought to predict potassium, based on the T wave characteristics, with no blood tests required. For the personalized model, we successfully calculated potassium values with an absolute error of 0.36±0.34 mmol/L (or 10\% of the measured blood potassium). For the global model, potassium prediction was also accurate, with an absolute error of 0.44±0.47 mmol/L for the training group (or 11\% of the measured blood potassium) and 0.5±0.42 for the validation set (or 12\% of the measured blood potassium).
CONCLUSIONS: The signal-processed ECG derived from a single lead can be used to calculate potassium values with clinically meaningful resolution using a strategy that requires no blood tests. This enables a cost-effective, noninvasive, unobtrusive strategy for potassium assessment that can be used during remote monitoring.},

A key attraction of this type of telehealth for health plans and employers is the potential savings involved in replacing physician office and emergency department visits with less expensive virtual visits. However, increased convenience may tap into unmet demand for health care, and new utilization may increase overall health care spending. We used commercial claims data on over 300,000 patients from three years (2011-13) to explore patterns of utilization and spending for acute respiratory illnesses. We estimated that 12 percent of direct-to-consumer telehealth visits replaced visits to other providers, and 88 percent represented new utilization. Net annual spending on acute respiratory illness increased \$45 per telehealth user. Direct-to-consumer telehealth may increase access by making care more convenient for certain patients, but it may also increase utilization and health care spending.},

They store representative rhythm strips when the heart rate exceeds preset limits or when the patient presses a button on the accompanying actuator. These records may be transferred for physician review during a subsequent office visit. Transoma's SLEUTH is a similar ILR, except that one of the electrodes is at the end of a 6-cm lead tunneled under the skin and the wider separation may result in a larger ECG amplitude. Instead of storing the records, SLEUTH transmits them through the skin to a home base unit, which sends them via telephone to a monitoring service. Angel Medical's ALERT system also has a tunneled lead, but one that is introduced pervenously into the right ventricle hoping to detect ST changes in addition to rhythm abnormalities. Advanced multivector ILR devices with integrated event alerting are rapidly approaching commercialization. AJ Medical Devices' CARDIOALARM (4 × 4 × 0.6 cm) has 4 electrodes at the corners of the square package, arranged as 2 orthogonal recording pairs that can produce a robust signal that is relatively immune to signal fluctuations caused by changes in the direction of cardiac activation and patient's body position. This permits accurate identification of dramatic changes in the ECG pattern, such as those occurring in ventricular fibrillation and polymorphic tachycardia. Because of this feature, CARDIOALARM can detect cardiac arrest, and its external receiver can alert bystanders to begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation and can automatically summon Emergency Medical Services. In the future, addition of other sensors, integration of data streams via body surface wireless networks, and real-time interpretive algorithms will allow enhanced monitoring systems to more generally assess evolving risks, the impacts of therapeutic interventions, and patient compliance with rehabilitative programs. When coupled to remote medical monitoring services, these devices have the potential to dramatically impact patient outcomes by lessening the diagnostic dependence on symptom recognition and decreasing event response times. Significant cost savings may also be realized through more efficient use of specialist resources, reduction in the number of office visits to physicians, and long-term improvements in patient health. Structural and behavior barriers to adoption need to be addressed for these methods to reach their full potential, addressing patient privacy concerns, adequate reimbursement, and integration into standard care protocols.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women's College Hospital (WCH) offers specialized surgical procedures, including ambulatory breast reconstruction in post-mastectomy breast cancer patients. Most patients receiving ambulatory surgery have low rates of postoperative events necessitating clinic visits. Increasingly, mobile monitoring and follow-up care is used to overcome the distance patients must travel to receive specialized care at a reduced cost to society. WCH has completed a feasibility study using a mobile app (QoC Health Inc, Toronto) that suggests high patient satisfaction and adequate detection of postoperative complications.
OBJECTIVE: The proposed cost-effectiveness study models the replacement of conventional, in-person postoperative follow-up care with mobile app follow-up care following ambulatory breast reconstruction in post-mastectomy breast cancer patients.
METHODS: This is a societal perspective cost-effectiveness analysis, wherein all costs are assessed irrespective of the payer. The patient/caregiver, health care system, and externally borne costs are calculated within the first postoperative month based on cost information provided by WCH and QoC Health Inc. The effectiveness of telemedicine and conventional follow-up care is measured as successful surgical outcomes at 30-days postoperative, and is modeled based on previous clinical trials containing similar patient populations and surgical risks.
RESULTS: This costing assumes that 1000 patients are enrolled in bring-your-own-device (BYOD) mobile app follow-up per year and that 1.64 in-person follow-ups are attended in the conventional arm within the first month postoperatively. The total cost difference between mobile app and in-person follow-up care is \$245 CAD (\$223 USD based on the current exchange rate), with in-person follow-up being more expensive (\$381 CAD) than mobile app follow-up care (\$136 CAD). This takes into account the total of health care system, patient, and external borne costs. If we examine health care system costs alone, in-person follow-up is \$38 CAD (\$35 USD) more expensive than mobile app follow-up care over the first postoperative month. The baseline difference in effect is modeled to be zero based on clinical trials examining the effectiveness of telephone follow-up care in similar patient populations. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is not reportable in this scenario. An incremental net benefit (INB) is reportable, and reflects merely the cost difference between the two interventions for any willingness-to-pay value (INB=\$245 CAD). The cost-effectiveness of mobile app follow-up even holds in scenarios where all mobile patients attend one in-person follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Mobile app follow-up care is suitably targeted to low-risk postoperative ambulatory patients. It can be cost-effective from a societal and health care system perspective.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Store-and-forward (S\&F) teledermatology has been used to increase patient access to dermatologic care. A major challenge to implementing S\&F teledermatology is selecting secure and cost-saving applications for data capture and transmission. Detailed analyses and comparison of the major S\&F teledermatology applications do not exist in the current peer-reviewed literature. The objectives of this study were to identify, evaluate, and compare the major S\&F teledermatology applications in the United States to help referral and consultant sites select applications responsive to their needs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified four major, commercially available S\&F teledermatology applications after surveying the members of the American Telemedicine Association Teledermatology Special Interest Group and the Telemedicine Task Force of the American Academy of Dermatology. A multidisciplinary team of dermatologists, primary care physicians, and information technologists established a set of criteria used to evaluate the applications. We performed a comparative analysis of the four major S\&F teledermatology applications based on the predetermined evaluation criteria.
RESULTS: The four major, commercially available S\&F teledermatology applications evaluated in this study were Alaska Federal Health Care Access Network, Medweb, TeleDerm Solutions, and Second Opinion. All four teledermatology applications were mature and capable of addressing the basic needs of S\&F teledermatology referrals and consultations. Each application adopts different approaches to organize medical information and facilitate consultations. Areas in need of improvement common to these major applications include (1) increased compatibility and integration with established electronic medical record systems, (2) development of fully integrated billing capability, (3) simplifying user interface and allowing user-designed templates to communicate recommendations and patient education, and (4) reducing the cost of the applications.
CONCLUSION: The four major S\&F teledermatology applications in the United States are versatile applications capable of facilitating communication between referral and consultant sites. Continued efforts in making these applications more secure, robust, user-friendly, and affordable will contribute to wider implementation of S\&F teledermatology.},

	abstract = {Telemedicine was used as a substitute for the telephone (usual care) for some acute care consultations from nurseries at four peripheral hospitals in Queensland. Over a 12-month study period, there were 19 cases of neonatal teleconsultation. Five (26\%) cases of avoided infant transport were confirmed by independent assessment, four of which were avoided helicopter retrievals. We conducted two analyses. In the first, the actual costs of providing telemedicine at the study sites were compared with the actual savings associated with confirmed avoided infant transport and nursery costs. There was a net saving to the health system of 54,400 Australian Dollars (AUD) associated with the use of telemedicine over the 12-month period. In the second analysis, we estimated the potential savings that might have been achieved if telemedicine had been used for all retrieval consultations from the study sites. The total projected costs were AUD 64,969 while the projected savings were AUD 271,042, i.e. a projected net saving to the health system of AUD 206,073 through the use of telemedicine. A sensitivity analysis suggested that the threshold proportion of retrievals needed to generate telemedicine-related savings under the study conditions was 5\%. The findings suggest that from the health-service perspective, the use of telemedicine for acute care neonatal consultation has substantial economic benefits.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine whether Telemedicine intervention can affect hospital mortality, length of stay, and direct costs for progressive care unit patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational.
SETTING: Large healthcare system in Florida.
PATIENTS: Adult patients admitted to progressive care unit (PCU) as their primary admission between December 2011 and August 2016 (n = 16,091).
INTERVENTIONS: Progressive care unit patients with telemedicine intervention (telemedicine PCU [TPCU]; n = 8091) and without telemedicine control (nontelemedicine PCU [NTPCU]; n = 8000) were compared concurrently during study period.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcome was progressive care unit and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay, progressive care unit length of stay, and mean direct costs. The mean age NTPCU and TPCU patients were 63.4 years (95\% CI, 62.9-63.8 yr) and 71.1 years (95\% CI, 70.7-71.4 yr), respectively. All Patient Refined-Diagnosis Related Group Disease Severity (p {\textless} 0.0001) and All Patient Refined-Diagnosis Related Group patient Risk of Mortality (p {\textless} 0.0001) scores were significantly higher among TPCU versus NTPCU. After adjusting for age, sex, race, disease severity, risk of mortality, hospital entity, and organ systems, TPCU survival benefit was 20\%. Mean progressive care unit length of stay was lower among TPCU compared with NTPCU (2.6 vs 3.2 d; p {\textless} 0.0001). Postprogressive care unit hospital length of stay was longer for TPCU patients, compared with NTPCU (7.3 vs 6.8 d; p {\textless} 0.0001). The overall mean direct cost was higher for TPCU (\$13,180), compared with NTPCU (\$12,301; p {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although there are many studies about the effects of telemedicine in ICU, currently there are no studies on the effects of telemedicine in progressive care unit settings. Our study showed that TPCU intervention significantly decreased mortality in progressive care unit and hospital and progressive care unit length of stay despite the fact patients in TPCU were older and had higher disease severity, and risk of mortality. Increased postprogressive care unit hospital length of stay and total mean direct costs inclusive of telemedicine costs coincided with improved survival rates. Telemedicine intervention decreased overall mortality and length of stay within progressive care units without substantial cost incurrences.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pre-anesthesia evaluation allows discovery of conditions affecting perioperative planning, but when inadequate it may be associated with delays, cancellations, and preventable adverse events. Not all patients who could benefit will keep appointments. Telemedicine pre-anesthesia evaluation may provide for safe patient care while reducing patient inconvenience and cost. Herein we investigate the impact of telemedicine pre-anesthesia evaluation on perioperative processes.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a single-center prospective randomized trial in 200 adults scheduled for head and neck surgery at Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA. Consenting patients not meeting criteria for telephone pre-anesthesia evaluation were randomly assigned to the in-person or telemedicine group. The primary outcome measure was inadequate evaluation caused surgical delay or cancellation. Secondary measures included prediction of difficult airway management and concordance of physical examination.
RESULTS: After consent, 40 patients met criteria for telephone screening. Five patients canceled surgery, none for inadequate pre-anesthesia evaluation; thus 155 were randomized. Delay occurred in 1 telemedicine patient awaiting results performed outside our system. Missing documentation at the time of the visit was less common for telemedicine. Difficult airway management was predicted equally but had low positive predictive value. Heart and lung examinations were highly concordant with day of surgery documentation. Patients and providers were highly satisfied with both evaluation modalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine and in-person evaluations were equivalent, with high patient and provider satisfaction. Telemedicine provides potential patient time and cost saving benefits without more day of surgery delay in our system. A prospective trial of patients from multiple surgical specialty clinics is warranted.},

This is why telerehabilitation systems are being developed, to allow monitoring and support of physiotherapy sessions at home, which could reduce healthcare costs while also improving the quality of life of the users.
OBJECTIVES: Our goal is the development of a Kinect-based algorithm that provides a very accurate real-time monitoring of physical rehabilitation exercises and that also provides a friendly interface oriented both to users and physiotherapists.
METHODS: The two main constituents of our algorithm are the posture classification method and the exercises recognition method. The exercises consist of series of movements. Each movement is composed of an initial posture, a final posture and the angular trajectories of the limbs involved in the movement. The algorithm was designed and tested with datasets of real movements performed by volunteers. We also explain in the paper how we obtained the optimal values for the trade-off values for posture and trajectory recognition.
RESULTS: Two relevant aspects of the algorithm were evaluated in our tests, classification accuracy and real-time data processing. We achieved 91.9\% accuracy in posture classification and 93.75\% accuracy in trajectory recognition. We also checked whether the algorithm was able to process the data in real-time. We found that our algorithm could process more than 20,000 postures per second and all the required trajectory data-series in real-time, which in practice guarantees no perceptible delays. Later on, we carried out two clinical trials with real patients that suffered shoulder disorders. We obtained an exercise monitoring accuracy of 95.16\%.
CONCLUSIONS: We present an exercise recognition algorithm that handles the data provided by Kinect efficiently. The algorithm has been validated in a real scenario where we have verified its suitability. Moreover, we have received a positive feedback from both users and the physiotherapists who took part in the tests.},

The diffusion of DVB-T standard and the low cost of DVB-T set-top boxes bring the vision of a capillary distribution of tele-home care monitoring systems with easy-to-use patient's interface.
METHODS: Exploiting the potentiality of the DVB-T set-top box, we transformed it into an "on-demand tele-home care interface". The Xlet we developed is able to govern the functionality of an external microcontroller-based unit for the acquisition of the bio-signals of interest. The uplink connection is used to send the exam results to a remote care center.
RESULTS: The Xlet providing the patient interface on the set-top box is uploaded by a DVB-T broadcaster without any intervention in the patient's home. A prototypal low-cost base station for the acquisition of the patient's signals (1-lead ECG) has been developed. It is able to be connected to the set-top box via an infrared link. A smart-card-based system is in charge for the customization of the Xlet for every patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed system, based on a currently widespread infrastructure, is able to allow the patients monitoring from home without any installation procedure. Even untrained (or elderly) people can easily use such system due to their practice with the basic DVB-T home-entertainment equipments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telecardiology is a tool that can aid in cardiovascular care, mainly in towns located in remote areas. However, economic assessments on this subject are scarce and have yielded controversial results.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-benefit of implementing a Telecardiology service in remote, small towns in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil.
METHODS: The study used the database from the Minas Telecardio (MTC) Project, developed from June 2006 to November 2008, in 82 towns in the countryside of the state. Each municipality received a microcomputer with a digital electrocardiograph, with the possibility of transmitting ECG tracings and communicating with the on-duty cardiologist at the University hospital. The cost-benefit analysis was carried out by comparing the cost of performing an ECG in the project versus the cost of performing it by patient referral to another city.
RESULTS: The average cost of an ECG in the MTC project was R\$ 28.92, decomposed into R\$ 8.08 for the cost of implementation and R\$ 20.84 for maintenance. The cost simulation of the ECG with referral ranged from R\$ 30.91 to R\$ 54.58, with the cost-benefit ratio being always favorable to the MTC program, regardless of the type of calculation used for referral distance. The simulations considered the financial sponsor's and society's points-of-view. The sensitivity analysis with variation of calibration parameters confirmed these results.
CONCLUSION: The implementation of a Telecardiology system as support to primary care in small Brazilian towns is feasible and economically beneficial, and can be used as a regular program within the Brazilian public health system.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the construct validity of a training and assessment model for precise laparoscopic handling of delicate tissue.
METHODS: Participants (n = 35) completed 2 progressively challenging laparoscopic tissue translocation exercises using delicate foam pieces and templates. Deidentified performances were scored using objective measures for tissue damage, accuracy, percentage complete, and completion time. Evaluation included multiple analysis of variance with repeated measures among the 3 groups as follows: medical students, residents and faculty who perform laparoscopic surgery less than once per week, and faculty members who perform laparoscopic surgery at least once per week.
RESULTS: The model demonstrated significant construct validity by discriminating performances between the types of shapes and templates and across the levels of surgical experience on all dimensions. A significant interaction effect between the level of expertise and the difficulty of the exercise revealed excellent discrimination between experienced laparoscopic surgeons and others.
DISCUSSION: This low-cost model provides an alternative or adjunct platform for laparoscopic training and assessment that requires precise and measurable handling of a delicate tissue.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the value that urologic patients place on video visits before the implementation of a telemedicine program at our institution's outpatient urology clinic.
METHODS: We conducted an on-site survey at a tertiary medical center's outpatient urology clinic over a 3-month period. Our survey questions assessed patient access to technology needed for video visits, patients' perceptions about video visits, the amount patients would be willing to pay out-of-pocket for video visits, and total time patients expect to spend during a standard clinic visit.
RESULTS: We completed 108 surveys of adult patients. Of the patients, 94\% owned a device that could be used for a video visit. The median level of patient interest in video visits was reported as 72 out of 100 (interquartile range: 51.25; scale: 0-100,) with a statistically significant difference in interest level across different age groups (P = .022). The median amount patients reported they were willing to pay out-of-pocket for video visits was \$20 (interquartile range: \$39.25, max: \$174).
CONCLUSION: The vast majority of patients in our outpatient urology clinic possess the technology necessary to engage in video visits. Patients are highly interested in video visits and report a willingness to share in the costs of these visits. Given that a portion of patients travel long distances for specialty clinic visits, video visits have the potential to substantially improve the patient experience.},

Telemedicine solutions for stroke are a level I, class A recommendation when a vascular neurologist is absent. However, current solutions require exorbitant startup costs, which are prohibitive for the rural hospitals in which they are needed most. This study demonstrates the efficacy of using the relatively inexpensive iPhone 4 in telestroke management. Twenty patients with stroke were assessed at the bedside using an iPhone 4, and each examination was directed remotely on another iPhone 4. Both the physician performing the bedside exam and the remote physician calculated a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score for each patient. Each physician was blinded to the other's NIHSS score. In the 20 patients assessed, NIHSS scores ranged from 0 to 22. Interrater reliability assessed using the κ statistic demonstrated excellent agreement in 10 items (level of consciousness, month and age, visual fields, right motor arm, left motor arm, right motor leg, left motor leg, sensation, language, and neglect), moderate agreement in 3 items (gaze, facial palsy, and dysarthria), and poor agreement in 1 item (ataxia). Total NIHSS scores obtained remotely and at bedside showed an excellent level of agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.98). Our findings indicate that the iPhone 4 is an economical mobile solution that can be used to assess stroke patients remotely with high fidelity and can be readily incorporated into a telestroke network.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: MUSIC is a multicenter nonrandomized study designed to develop and validate an algorithm for prediction of impending acute HF decompensation with the use of physiologic signals obtained from an external device adhered to the chest. A total of 543 HF patients (206 development, 337 validation) with ejection fraction ≤40\% and a recent HF admission were enrolled. Patients were remotely monitored for 90 days using a multisensor device. Accounting for device failure and patient withdrawal, 314 patients (114 development, 200 validation) were included in the analysis. Development patient data were used to develop a multiparameter HF detection algorithm. Algorithm performance in the development cohort had 65\% sensitivity, 90\% specificity, and a false positive rate of 0.7 per patient-year for detection of HF events. In the validation cohort, algorithm performance met the prespecified end points with 63\% sensitivity, 92\% specificity, and a false positive rate of 0.9 per patient-year. The overall rate of significant adverse skin response was 0.4\%.
CONCLUSION: Using an external multisensor monitoring system, an HF decompensation prediction algorithm was developed that met the prespecified performance end point. Further studies are required to determine whether the use of this system will improve patient outcomes.},

METHODS: The MUSIC (Multi-Sensor Monitoring in Congestive Heart Failure) study comprises 2 multicenter nonrandomized phases (MUSIC-Development and MUSIC-Validation) designed to develop and validate an algorithm for the prediction of acute HF decompensation using multiple physiologic signals obtained from an external, adherent, multisensor system capable of intermittent transmission of physiologic signals. Data obtained from MUSIC-Development will be used to develop the algorithm to predict HF decompensation. The algorithm will be validated in MUSIC-Validation with the objectives of ≥ 60\% sensitivity for correctly predicting an acute HF event, a false-positive patient status signal rate of ≤ 1.0 per patient-year, and a safety endpoint of ≤ 5\% of patients experiencing significant adverse skin conditions related to the prolonged wearing of the adherent device. A total of 542 patients in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV HF, with ejection fraction ≤ 40\% and a recent HF admission, are enrolled in MUSIC-Development (n = 180) and MUSIC-Validation (n = 362). All patients are remotely monitored for 90 days using the Corventis multisensor system that transmits bioimpedance, electrocardiogram, and accelerometer data.
RESULTS: The MUSIC study has completed patient enrollment and follow-up in both phases. Once algorithm development is complete from the MUSIC-Development phase, the sequestered data set from the MUSIC-Validation phase will be used for algorithm validation.},

	abstract = {Telemedicine models using commercially available technology have enabled high-quality illness care in paediatric primary care settings and markedly improved access. This fact should be explored in Pediatric Dentistry, considering that dental problems are very common in children at pre-school age and it becomes important to screen them as early as possible in order to promote the appropriate treatment. In this sense, we aim to know how telemedicine, or more specifically, teledentistry, could help on this process, evaluating the validity of children dental problems remote diagnosis based on non-invasive photographs, using accessible and low-cost technologies. Three photographs were taken for each of 66 children to be remotely analyzed by four dentists. Each dentist filled a web-based questionnaire for each child. The same children had a traditional in-person dental consultation that is used as a gold standard in this study. The results show sensitivity between 94\% and 100\% and specificity between 52\% and 100\%. The positive predictive value was between 67\% and 100\% and the negative predictive value between 94\% and 100\%. These results suggest that remote diagnosis of children dental problems based on non-invasive photographs constitute a valid resource when we pretend to exclude referred children to a dentist for treatment of dental problems, but further studies should be carried out to increase the validity of this proceeding to referring children for the same treatment.},

We then explored the security of the scheme with its resilience to attacks. Moreover, we formally validated the proposed scheme through the simulation using Automated Validation of Internet Security Schemes and Applications software whose outcomes confirm that the scheme is protected against active and passive attacks. The performance comparison demonstrated that the proposed scheme has lower communication cost than the existing schemes in literature. In addition, the computation cost of the proposed scheme is nearly equal to the exiting schemes. The proposed scheme not only efficient in terms of different security attacks, but it also provides an efficient login, mutual authentication, session key agreement and verification and password update phases along with password recovery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Newborn hearing screening is a vital aspect of the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention program, aimed at detecting hearing loss in children for prompt treatment. In Ghana, this kind of pediatric hearing service is available at only one health care facility located in the Greater Accra Region. The current practice in effect has virtually cut-off infants in the other regions from accessing hearing screening and other pediatric audiological services. This has prompted a study into alternative methodologies to expand the reach of such services in Ghana. The present study was designed to assess the feasibility of using telehealth to deliver newborn hearing screening across Ghana.
PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of using telehealth to extend newborn hearing screening services across the ten regions of Ghana.
RESEARCH DESIGN: A correlational study was designed to determine the extent of association between test results of telehealth and the conventional on-site methods (COMs) for conducting newborn hearing screening. The design also allowed for testing duration between the two methods to be compared.
STUDY SAMPLE: Fifty infants from the Brong-Ahafo Regional Hospital (BARH) were enrolled. The infants aged between 2 and 90 days were selected through convenience sampling. There were 30 males and 20 females.
PROCEDURE: Newborn hearing screening using distortion product otoacoustic emissions were performed via telehealth. By adopting the synchronous telehealth model, an audiologist located at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital conducted real-time hearing screening tests over the internet on infants who were at the BARH. The former and latter hospitals are located in the Greater Accra and the Brong-Ahafo Regions, respectively. As a control, similar hearing screening tests were conducted on the same infants at BARH using the conventional face-to-face on-site hearing screening method.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The test results and testing duration of the telehealth method and the conventional on-site approach were compared and subjected to statistical analysis. Here, the Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) was used to determine the level of correlation between the test results, whereas the paired t-test statistic was used to test the level of significance between the testing duration of the two methods.
RESULTS: Analysis of the test results showed a significantly high positive correlation between the telehealth and the COMs (rs = 0.778, 0.878, 0.857, 0.823, p {\textless} 0.05 @ 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 kHz respectively). Also, the difference in testing duration of the two methods was not statistically significant [t(99) = 1.309, p {\textgreater} 0.05]. The mean testing duration (in seconds) of telehealth was 27.287 (standard deviation = 27.373) and that of the COM was 24.689 (standard deviation = 27.169).
CONCLUSION: The study showed the feasibility of establishing an interregional network of newborn hearing screening services across Ghana using telehealth. It is more efficient to deploy telehealth for pediatric hearing services than to have patients travel many hours to the Greater Accra Region for similar services. Poor road network, high transportation costs, and bad weather conditions are a few of the reasons for avoiding long distance travel in Ghana.},

They are responsible for the majority of deaths at sea that are not related to injury or violence. The objective was to better understand the epidemiology of CVD in merchant maritime operations.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of medical events on board merchant maritime vessels over a period of two years, from a US-based telemedicine provider's database.
RESULTS: A total of 1,394 cases were initially retrieved from the database. CVD was diagnosed in 29 cases and was the eleventh leading cause for accessing the telemedicine provider. Five deaths occurred in the study period, three of which related to CVDs. CVDs resulted in more diversions and the utilization of more urgent means of communication.
DISCUSSION: CVDs present a challenge in maritime health. The current pre-employment system is not, in a reasonable cost/benefit balance, able to prevent on board events from occurring. The success of telemedicine depends heavily on the onsite resources, both human and material. Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs), along with other devices such as multi-parameter monitors, are tools generally available to address acute presentations of CVDs, but their applicability on board commercial ships is a matter of controversy.
CONCLUSIONS: CVDs are an important concern in commercial maritime operations due to the need for subsequent evaluation and potential complications including the risk of sudden cardiac arrest. In this study, CVDs were probably responsible for three on board deaths. Additional research is warranted to provide more evidence about the best resources to have on board to handle CVDs more effectively.},

Participants in this breakout session were asked to address, from their diverse perspectives, a series of questions relating to the current and potential uses of telehealth applications and networks for public health and emergency/disaster preparedness and response systems. Participants identified several gaps in current understanding and research emphasis. There is a clear need for more and larger outcome studies to assess the impact and cost benefit of telehealth applications in terms of improving public health at the population and community levels. In addition, more research is needed to demonstrate the ability of telehealth tools and technologies to facilitate and extend the reach of major national clinical and public health research initiatives. Perhaps most importantly, the National Institutes of Health should develop and/or strengthen strategic partnerships with other funding agencies with overlapping or complementary interests to accelerate interdisciplinary research in this rapidly evolving but relatively understudied and complex field.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis control efforts are hampered by a mismatch in diagnostic technology: modern optimal diagnostic tests are least available in poor areas where they are needed most. Lack of adequate early diagnostics and MDR detection is a critical problem in control efforts. The Microscopic Observation Drug Susceptibility (MODS) assay uses visual recognition of cording patterns from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) to diagnose tuberculosis infection and drug susceptibility directly from a sputum sample in 7-10 days with a low cost. An important limitation that laboratories in the developing world face in MODS implementation is the presence of permanent technical staff with expertise in reading MODS. We developed a pattern recognition algorithm to automatically interpret MODS results from digital images. The algorithm using image processing, feature extraction and pattern recognition determined geometrical and illumination features used in an object-model and a photo-model to classify TB-positive images. 765 MODS digital photos were processed. The single-object model identified MTB (96.9\% sensitivity and 96.3\% specificity) and was able to discriminate non-tuberculous mycobacteria with a high specificity (97.1\% M. avium, 99.1\% M. chelonae, and 93.8\% M. kansasii). The photo model identified TB-positive samples with 99.1\% sensitivity and 99.7\% specificity. This algorithm is a valuable tool that will enable automatic remote diagnosis using Internet or cellphone telephony. The use of this algorithm and its further implementation in a telediagnostics platform will contribute to both faster TB detection and MDR TB determination leading to an earlier initiation of appropriate treatment.},

These institutions have built hospitals and retirement homes that have been rapidly overfilled, making their associated maintenance and operating costs prohibitive. The latest advances in technology and communications envisage new ways to monitor those people with special needs at their own home, increasing their quality of life in a cost-affordable way. The purpose of this paper is to present an Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) platform able to analyze, identify, and detect specific acoustic events happening in daily life environments, which enables the medic staff to remotely track the status of every patient in real-time. Additionally, this tele-care proposal is validated through a proof-of-concept experiment that takes benefit of the capabilities of the NVIDIA Graphical Processing Unit running on a Jetson TK1 board to locally detect acoustic events. Conducted experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by reaching an overall accuracy of 82\% when identifying a set of 14 indoor environment events related to the domestic surveillance and patients' behaviour monitoring field. Obtained results encourage practitioners to keep working in this direction, and enable health care providers to remotely track the status of their patients in real-time with non-invasive methods.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a chronic disease, with high prevalence across many nations, which is characterized by elevated level of blood glucose and risk of acute and chronic complication. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has one of the highest levels of diabetes prevalence globally. It is well-known that the treatment of diabetes is complex process and requires both lifestyle change and clear pharmacologic treatment plan. To avoid the complication from diabetes, the effective behavioural change and extensive education and self-management is one of the key approaches to alleviate such complications. However, this process is lengthy and expensive. The recent studies on the user of smart phone technologies for diabetes self-management have proven to be an effective tool in controlling hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels especially in type-2 diabetic (T2D) patients. However, to date no reported study addressed the effectiveness of this approach in the in Saudi patients. This study investigates the impact of using mobile health technologies for the self-management of diabetes in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: In this study, an intelligent mobile diabetes management system (SAED), tailored for T2D patients in KSA was developed. A pilot study of the SAED system was conducted in Saudi Arabia with 20 diabetic patients for 6 months duration. The patients were randomly categorized into a control group who did not use the SAED system and an intervention group whom used the SAED system for their diabetes management during this period. At the end of the follow-up period, the HbA1c levels in the patients in both groups were measure together with a diabetes knowledge test was also conducted to test the diabetes awareness of the patients.
RESULTS: The results of SAED pilot study showed that the patients in the intervention group were able to significantly decrease their HbA1c levels compared to the control group. The SAED system also enhanced the diabetes awareness amongst the patients in the intervention group during the trial period. These outcomes confirm the global studies on the effectiveness of smart phone technologies in diabetes management. The significance of the study is that this was one of the first such studies conducted on Saudi patients and of their acceptance for such technology in their diabetes self-management treatment plans.
CONCLUSIONS: The pilot study of the SAED system showed that a mobile health technology can significantly improve the HbA1C levels among Saudi diabetic and improve their disease management plans. The SAED system can also be an effective and low-cost solution in improving the quality of life of diabetic patients in the Kingdom considering the high level of prevalence and the increasing economic burden of this disease.},

Nurses currently leverage Telehealth to deliver care and education, monitor clients remotely and support medical consultations. Over 90\% of Island Health nurses surveyed recommend Telehealth as a care modality to clients and 100\% support Telehealth as a means to increase care to vulnerable communities. Programs wish to increase uptake of TeleNursing but face numerous challenges regarding funding, resourcing, scheduling and geographical ownership. TeleNursing goes beyond clinical support and has the potential to exponentially expand Telehealth services, normalizing Telehealth as a care modality.

	abstract = {PROBLEM: The Brazilian population lacks equitable access to specialized health care and diagnostic tests, especially in remote municipalities, where health professionals often feel isolated and staff turnover is high. Telehealth has the potential to improve patients' access to specialized health care, but little is known about it in terms of cost-effectiveness, access to services or user satisfaction.
APPROACH: In 2005, the State Government of Minas Gerais, Brazil, funded the establishment of the Telehealth Network, intended to connect university hospitals with the state's remote municipal health departments; support professionals in providing tele-assistance; and perform tele-electrocardiography and teleconsultations. The network uses low-cost equipment and has employed various strategies to overcome the barriers to telehealth use.
LOCAL SETTING: The Telehealth Network connects specialists in state university hospitals with primary health-care professionals in 608 municipalities of the large state of Minas Gerais, many of them in remote areas.
RELEVANT CHANGES: From June 2006 to October 2011, 782,773 electrocardiograms and 30 883 teleconsultations were performed through the network, and 6000 health professionals were trained in its use. Most of these professionals (97\%) were satisfied with the system, which was cost-effective, economically viable and averted 81\% of potential case referrals to distant centres.
LESSONS LEARNT: To succeed, a telehealth service must be part of a collaborative network, meet the real needs of local health professionals, use simple technology and have at least some face-to-face components. If applied to health problems for which care is in high demand, this type of service can be economically viable and can help to improve patient access to specialized health care.},

The electrocardiogram (ECG) readings are analyzed using a detrended fluctuation technique and classified into pathological cases using an unassisted K-means clustering algorithm. We analyzed 30 batches of 2-hour ECG signals taken from cardiac patients (20 males, 10 females, mean age 46.7 years) with pre-diagnosed pathologies. The method successfully categorized the 30 subjects without user intervention into the following cases: normal (at 86.7\% accuracy), congestive heart failure (86.7\%), and atrial fibrillation (80.0\%). The synergy of mobile monitoring and fluctuation analysis presents a powerful platform to reach remote, underserved communities with poor or nonexistent wired communication structures. It is likely to be essential in the development of new mobile diagnostic and prognostic measures.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to assess the impact of live interactive telenephrology on diagnosis and disease management, patients' quality of life, and time- and cost savings.
METHODS: A pre-test-post-test one-group design was used to evaluate the process and outcomes of the teleconsultations among all consecutive patients who attended or were referred to the teleclinics for suspected kidney diseases. Patients were interviewed for relevant information and their quality of life was assessed during the first visit. The quality-of-life questionnaires (short form (SF) 8) were filled 8 weeks after the last visit to assess the changes in the quality of life.
RESULTS: A total of 64 patients were included in this study. The treatment plan changed from that of the referring health provider for 31.2\% of patients. The vast majority of patients stated that their visits to teleclinics were associated with less waiting time and lower cost (96.9\% and 98.4\%, respectively). The total satisfaction score of patients with the services received ranged from 71.2 to 100 with a mean of 96.8 (standard deviation 4.8), indicating a high level of satisfaction. After 2 months of consultations, the mean SF8 score increased significantly from 33.1 to 45.0 (p{\textless}0.019), which implies that the telenephrology care was associated with better quality of life, mainly the physical component of quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Telenephrology care in remote areas of Jordan would improve the access to health care, help to reach proper diagnoses and establish the treatment plan, and is associated with better quality of life.},

The system design is based on a number of fundamental requirements that set it apart from other recent proposals: low cost of implementation, the possibility of application in coastal shallow-water marine environments, suitable dimensions for deployment and stability of the sensor system in a shifting environment like the sea bed, and total autonomy of power supply and data recording. The buoy system has successfully performed remote monitoring of temperature and marine pressure (SBE 39 sensor), temperature (MCP9700 sensor) and atmospheric pressure (YOUNG 61302L sensor). The above requirements have been satisfactorily validated by operational trials in a marine environment. The proposed buoy sensor system thus seems to offer a broad range of applications.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Remote monitoring is increasingly becoming the new standard of care for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) follow-up. We sought to determine whether remote monitoring of ICDs improves patient outcomes compared with quarterly device interrogations in clinic.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this single-center pilot clinical trial, adult patients with an ICD were randomly assigned to remote monitoring versus quarterly device interrogations in clinic. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular hospitalization, emergency room visit for a cardiac cause, and unscheduled visit to the electrophysiology clinic for a device-related issue at 1 year. We also examined health-related quality of life, costs, and patient satisfaction with their ICD care. Of 151 patients enrolled in this trial, 76 were randomized to remote monitoring and 75 to quarterly device interrogations in clinic. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint (32\% in the remote monitoring arm vs 34\% in the control arm; P = 0.8), mortality, or cost between the 2 arms. Quality of life and patient satisfaction were significantly better in the control arm than in the remote monitoring arm at 6 months (83 [25th, 75th percentiles 70, 90] vs 75 [50, 85]; P = 0.002 and 88 [75, 100] vs 75 [75, 88]; P = 0.03, respectively), but not at 12 months.
CONCLUSION: We showed no significant reduction in cardiac-related resource utilization with remote monitoring of ICDs. However, given the small number of patients in our study, the real clinical and health economics impact of remote monitoring needs to be verified by a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and suboptimal glycaemic control in Kuwait requires novel, wide-reaching, low-cost interventions to motivate and mobilise individuals towards more effective self-management. More than 2 million people in Kuwait own mobile phones. We will test whether automated personalised health text messages based on principles of motivational interviewing and are responsive to biodata delivered remotely is potentially effective in improving glycaemic control compared to usual care.
METHODS: This is a two-arm parallel single-blind randomised controlled trial of 572 individuals with type 2 diabetes in Kuwait. We will develop a culturally appropriate database of text messages supporting positive lifestyle changes in type 2 diabetes. A computer programme will deliver over 400 text messages over a 12-month period using algorithms which provide participants with information on diet and physical activity as well as personalised messages regarding motivators to change behaviours. Individuals aged 18-75 years with established type 2 diabetes who are fluent in Arabic or English and officially resident in Kuwait will be identified via screening of hospital diabetes clinic and primary care practices and invited to participate. A sample of 572 participants will be randomised to usual care or usual care plus the DATES text message intervention. Randomisation will be conducted by an independent Clinical Trials Unit and researchers collecting baseline and outcome data will be blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is change in HbA1c and weight at 12 months in both study arms. Secondary outcomes will include changes in physical activity, fasting lipids and quality of life in both study arms.
DISCUSSION: The potential of mobile phones in improving diabetes self-care in settings with a high prevalence of diabetes and widespread mobile phone usage has face validity. Mobile phones and text messaging are an understudied virtual communication media which can deliver discrete focused psychological support to motivate and enable diabetes self-care changes.

One major limitation from intravenous thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is patient`s arrival to the emergency room at a tertiary care hospital after the therapeutic time-window, which is generally 270 minutes. The problem is worse for people living in suburban areas where stroke expertise can be missing. Therefore, telestroke networks were developed at several sites where a stroke neurologist at a tertiary hospital participates through synchronous audio-video teleconference in confirming diagnosis of stroke, assessing risks and benefits of giving IV t-PA, and making the decision with the patient and emergency physician at the local hospital. In this article, we will review the experience of major telestroke networks in North America and Europe, and the evidence of its safety and cost-effectiveness. Telestroke complexity, with regard to practice, manpower, quality assurance, and legal issues will be discussed briefly.},

The mean DLQI score decreased significantly (P {\textless} 0.005) indicating that there had been an improvement in the patients' quality of life since baseline. Most patients perceived that the visit to the teledermatology clinic required less travel time (96\%), shorter waiting time (83\%) and less cost (96\%) than a visit to the specialist clinic at the main hospital. The patients' mean satisfaction score was 90.5 (SD 8.5), indicating a high level of satisfaction. Teledermatology resulted in changes in the patients' diagnosis and treatment plan, and was associated with improved health state and quality of life.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence for the use of telephone consultation in childhood inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is lacking. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost consequences of telephone consultation compared with the usual out-patient face-to-face consultation for young people with IBD.
METHODS: We conducted a randomised-controlled trial in Manchester, UK, between July 12, 2010 and June 30, 2013. Young people (aged 8-16 years) with IBD were randomized to receive telephone consultation or face-to-face consultation for 24 months. The primary outcome measure was the paediatric IBD-specific IMPACT quality of life (QOL) score at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures included patient satisfaction with consultations, disease course, anthropometric measures, proportion of consultations attended, duration of consultations, and costs to the UK National Health Service (NHS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02319798.
FINDINGS: Eighty six patients were randomised to receive either telephone consultation (n = 44) or face-to-face consultation (n = 42). Baseline characteristics of the two groups were well balanced. At 12 months, there was no evidence of difference in QOL scores (estimated treatment effect in favour of the telephone consultation group was 5.7 points, 95\% CI - 2.9 to 14.3; p = 0.19). Mean consultation times were 9.8 min (IQR 8 to 12.3) for telephone consultation, and 14.3 min (11.6 to 17.0) for face-to-face consultation with an estimated reduction (95\% CI) of 4.3 (2.8 to 5.7) min in consultation times (p {\textless} 0.001). Telephone consultation had a mean cost of UK£35.41 per patient consultation compared with £51.12 for face-face consultation, difference £15.71 (95\% CI 11.8-19.6; P {\textless} 0.001).
INTERPRETATION: We found no suggestion of inferiority of telephone consultation compared with face-to-face consultation with regard to improvements in QOL scores, and telephone consultation reduced consultation time and NHS costs. Telephone consultation is a cost-effective alternative to face-to-face consultation for the routine outpatient follow-up of children and adolescents with IBD.

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.04.017},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Tele-homecare is gaining prominence as a viable care alternative, as evidenced by the increase in financial support from international governments to fund initiatives in their respective countries. The primary reason for the funding is to support efforts to reduce lags and increase capacity in access to care as well as to promote preventive measures that can avert costly emergent issues from arising. These efforts are especially important to super-aged and aging societies such as in Japan, many European countries, and the United States (US). However, to date and to our knowledge, a direct comparison of non-government vs. government-supported funding models for tele-homecare is particularly lacking in Japan. The aim of this study is to compare these operational models (i.e., non-government vs. government-supported funding) from a cost-benefit perspective. This simulation study applies to a Japanese hypothetical cohort with implications for other super-aged and aging societies abroad.
METHODS: We performed a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) on two operational models for enabling tele-homecare for elderly community-dwelling cohorts based on a decision tree model, which we created with parameters from published literature. The two models examined are (a) Model 1-non-government-supported funding that includes monthly fixed charges paid by users for a portion of the operating costs, and (b) Model 2-government-supported funding that includes startup and installation costs only (i.e., no operating costs) and no monthly user charges. We performed base case cost-benefit analysis and probabilistic cost-benefit analysis with a Monte Carlo simulation. We calculated net benefit and benefit-to-cost ratios (BCRs) from the societal perspective with a five-year time horizon applying a 3\% discount rate for both cost and benefit values. The cost of tele-homecare included (a) the startup system expense, averaged over a five-year depreciation period, and (b) operation expenses (i.e., labor and non-labor) per user per year. The benefit of tele-homecare was measured by annual willingness to pay (WTP) for tele-homecare by a user and medical expenditures avoided. Both costs and benefits were inflated using the relevant Japanese consumer price index (CPI) and converted into 2015 US dollars with purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted.
RESULTS: Base case net benefits of Model 1 and Model 2 were \$417.00 and \$97.30, respectively. Base case BCR of Model 1 tele-homecare was 1.63, while Model 2 was 1.03. The probabilistic analysis estimated mean (95\%CI) for BCRs of Model 1 and Model 2 was 1.84 (1.89, 1.88) and 1.46 (1.43, 1.49), respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed robustness of Model 1 in 7 parameters but Model 2 was sensitive in all key parameters such as initial system cost, device cost, number of users, and medical expenditure saved. Break-even analysis showed that the system cost of Model 2 had to be under \$187,500.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results for each model collectively showed that tele-homecare in Japan is cost-saving to some extent. However, the government-funded model (i.e., Model 2), which typically requires use of all startup funding to be spent within the first year on system costs, was inferior to the monthly fee model (i.e., Model 1) that did not use the government funding for installation or continued operations, but rather incorporated a monthly fee from users to support the receipt of services via tele-homecare. While the benefits of Model 1 outweighed the benefits of Model 2, the government-subsidized method employed in Model 2 could be more beneficial in general if some explicit prequalifying estimated metrics are instituted prior to funding. Thus, governments need to require applicants requesting funding to note, at a minimum, (a) estimated costs, (b) the expected number of tele-homecare users, and expected benefits such as (c) WTP by the user, or (d) medical expenditure saved by tele-homecare as a means of financing some of the operational costs.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Video-based treatment in telemedicine is a potential alternative to face-to-face treatment. We describe our trial use of telemedicine to treat a patient with primary headache.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 25-year-old woman visited our branch hospital with a chief complaint of recurrent headache. Our branch hospital had no headache specialist, so a headache specialist at our main hospital provided treatment remotely.
DIAGNOSES: She was diagnosed with migraine without aura by the headache specialist using telemedicine.
INTERVENTIONS: The branch hospital physician and the headache specialist used video conferencing to interview and examine the patient and share cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Audio and camera angle/zoom could be adjusted during interviews, and high-quality video was continuously displayed at both hospitals simultaneously without lag between audio and video. Temporal/spatial resolution was sufficient for proper neurological evaluation. MRI had sufficient image quality and resolution for detailed interpretation. A prescription for medication was issued by the branch hospital physician and confirmed by the headache specialist.
OUTCOMES: Zolmitriptan was effective in treating her migraine.
LESSONS: Telemedicine was useful for treating this primary headache patient and can contribute to regional health care. Future challenges in telemedicine include expanding its use to other areas within the purview of general physicians and headache specialists, covering implementation and maintenance costs, providing adequate explanations to patients and family members, ensuring security of video transmissions, maintaining patient medical records, and supervising treatment.},

METHODS: This controlled study included out-of-town epilepsy patients coming to follow-up at the University of Alberta hospital epilepsy clinic. After an informed consent, patients were randomized to either conventional (n = 18) or telemedicine (n = 23) clinics. Patients or caregivers filled patient satisfaction and travel cost questionnaires in both alternatives. Cost per visit analysis included costs of traveling, lodging, and lost productivity.
RESULTS: Average age of the population was 41 years (range 19-73; 45\% women). Eighty-three percent of patients preferred their next visit through telemedicine. About 90\% of patients indicated a need for companion travel (mainly by car) to conventional clinic. For the conventional group patients the value of lost productivity was CAD \$201, hotel cost CAD \$8.50, and the value of car mileage CAD \$256.50, totaling about CAD \$466.00. Patient costs for telemedicine were CAD \$35.85. Telemedicine production costs are similar to the patients' savings in traveling and lost productivity. About 90\% of patients in both groups were satisfied with the quality of the service.
CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can play a role in follow-up care of epilepsy patients, reduce patient costs, and improve patient satisfaction. This is the first full-time epilepsy telemedicine clinic in Western Canada.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The health system of Bangladesh is haunted by challenges of accessibility and affordability. Despite impressive gains in many health indicators, recent evidence has raised concerns regarding the utilization, quality and equity of healthcare. In the context of new and unfamiliar public health challenges including high population density and rapid urbanization, eHealth and mHealth are being promoted as a route to cost-effective, equitable and quality healthcare in Bangladesh. The aim of this paper is to highlight such initiatives and understand their true potential.
METHODS: This scoping study applies a combination of research tools to explore 26 eHealth and mHealth initiatives in Bangladesh. A screening matrix was developed by modifying the framework of Arksey \& O'Malley, further complemented by case study and SWOT analysis to identify common traits among the selected interventions. The WHO health system building blocks approach was then used for thematic analysis of these traits.
RESULTS: Findings suggest that most eHealth and mHealth initiatives have proliferated within the private sector, using mobile phones. The most common initiatives include tele-consultation, prescription and referral. While a minority of projects have a monitoring and evaluation framework, less than a quarter have undertaken evaluation. Most of the initiatives use a health management information system (HMIS) to monitor implementation. However, these do not provide for effective sharing of information and interconnectedness among the various actors. There are extremely few individuals with eHealth training in Bangladesh and there is a strong demand for capacity building and experience sharing, especially for implementation and policy making. There is also a lack of research evidence on how to design interventions to meet the needs of the population and on potential benefits.
CONCLUSION: This study concludes that Bangladesh needs considerable preparation and planning to sustain eHealth and mHealth initiatives successfully. Additional formative and operational research is essential to explore the true potential of the technology. Frameworks for regulation in regards to eHealth governance should be the aim of future research on the integration of eHealth and mHealth into the Bangladesh health system.},

A core objective of this paper is to introduce the design of a more reliable and dependable Medical Network Channel Code system (MNCC) through GSM Network. MNCC design based on simple concatenated channel code, which is cascade of an inner code (GSM) and an extra outer code (Convolution Code) in order to protect medical data more robust against channel errors than other data using the existing GSM network. In this paper, the MNCC system will provide Bit Error Rate (BER) equivalent to the BER for medical tele monitoring of physiological signals, which is 10(-5) or less. The performance of the MNCC has been proven and investigated using computer simulations under different channels condition such as, Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), Rayleigh noise and burst noise.

In the past decade, the sector has grown exponentially and become a billion-dollar industry in the developed world. While telemedicine holds the promise to transcend many of the barriers impeding healthcare delivery in emerging markets, unfortunately Pakistan has not been able to obtain any significant benefit from these advancements. The lack of a regulatory framework and lack of interest from the government makes it difficult for new companies to set up projects in Pakistan which will deliver healthcare in innovative, cost-effective ways. A survey conducted across different levels of the medical community showed that only a small minority of the medical community is familiar with the concept and applications of telemedicine. From a business perspective, the landscape is ripe in Pakistan. Since other developing countries have been able to use telemedicine effectively, Pakistan should also look into the options available and catch up soon.},

CloVR-Comparative combines commonly used bioinformatics tools into an intuitive, automated, and cloud-enabled analysis pipeline for comparative microbial genomics.
RESULTS: CloVR-Comparative runs on annotated complete or draft genome sequences that are uploaded by the user or selected via a taxonomic tree-based user interface and downloaded from NCBI. CloVR-Comparative runs reference-free multiple whole-genome alignments to determine unique, shared and core coding sequences (CDSs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Output includes short summary reports and detailed text-based results files, graphical visualizations (phylogenetic trees, circular figures), and a database file linked to the Sybil comparative genome browser. Data up- and download, pipeline configuration and monitoring, and access to Sybil are managed through CloVR-Comparative web interface. CloVR-Comparative and Sybil are distributed as part of the CloVR virtual appliance, which runs on local computers or the Amazon EC2 cloud. Representative datasets (e.g. 40 draft and complete Escherichia coli genomes) are processed in {\textless}36 h on a local desktop or at a cost of {\textless}\$20 on EC2.

There is a need for a system, capable of monitoring the holistic impact of the environment on cultural materials while remaining relatively easy to use and providing remote access. This paper describes a dosimetric system based on piezoelectric quartz crystal technology. The prototype sensing module consists of an array of piezoelectric quartz crystals (PQC) coated with different metals (Fe, Cu, Ni and Sn) and includes a temperature and relative humidity sensor. The communication module involves an 802.15.4 low-power radio and a GPRS gateway which allows real time visualisation of the measurements online. An energy management protocol ensures that the system consumes very low power between measurements. The paper also describes the results and experiences from two heritage field deployments, at Apsley House in London, UK, and at the Royal Palaces of Abomey in Benin. Evaluation of PQC measurements, temperature, relative humidity and the rate of successful transmission over the communication systems are also reported.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10140-016-1465-3},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Emergency radiology requires rapid and accurate interpretation of imaging examinations. Missed findings may lead to adverse outcomes. Double reporting may be used to minimize errors. Limited contemporaneous double reporting may be most efficient and cost-effective, but no data exists. This study is intended to examine the benefits of double reading and identify examinations where this would be most useful.
METHODS: In this study, dual reporting was conducted in a parallel reading environment in a teleradiology practice for 3779 radiological procedures performed at two radiology centers in the USA over a period of 4 months. Discrepancies between reads were scored using the ACR peer review scoring system and grouped by modality and body part. Errors were tabulated across the study types, followed by identification of statistically significant differences. The interaction between image number and odds of an error was ascertained.
RESULTS: In 145 instances (3.8\%; 95 \% CI, 3.2-4.4\%), double reporting identified errors, leading to report modification. Study type was significantly related to error frequency (p = 0.0001), with higher than average frequencies of error seen for CT abdomen and pelvis and MRI head or spine, but lower than average for CT head, CT spine, and ultrasound. Image number was positively associated with error odds, but was not independently significant in a joint logistic regression model that included study type.
CONCLUSION: Dual reporting identifies missed findings in about 1 of 25 emergency studies. This benefit varies substantially across study types and limited double reporting, merits further investigation as a cost-effective practice improvement strategy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adequacy assessment for fine-needle aspiration procedures is a standard of care in large medical centers. Although the benefits of this approach include higher adequacy rates with fewer passes, it costs cytopathologist time and affects other clinical responsibilities. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the use of mobile video streaming (FaceTime) technology with the help of smartphone adapters attached to microscopes for remote adequacy assessment of cytologic samples.
METHODS: The study consisted of 2 phases: Phase 1 was a retrospective assessment of 25 samples by a primary pathologist with simultaneous streaming to a second pathologist using a smartphone (iPhone/iPad) FaceTime connection. Data on the adequacy of each sample and preliminary diagnoses were recorded. In phase 2, live cases were assessed prospectively by an onsite primary pathologist and by a remote pathologist using an iPhone/iPad-FaceTime connection. The testing phase involved prospective assessment of additional samples with a resident or cytotechnologist as the slide driver.
RESULTS: In phase 1, retrospective evaluation of 25 samples yielded considerable agreement (22 of 25 samples; 88\%) between onsite and remote adequacy assessments. Three samples (12\%) yielded results that did not agree, including 2 samples that were read as adequate in the onsite evaluation that were assessed as indeterminate using FaceTime. In phase 2 and in the testing phase, 14 samples exhibited considerable agreement on both adequacy and preliminary diagnosis (6 samples in phase 2 and 8 samples in the testing phase) and are currently available for reporting. Problems encountered include software version standardization, camera alignment, and (rarely) comprehension of the audio stream.
CONCLUSIONS: The current data indicate that iPhone/iPad FaceTime technology can be used to perform remote adequacy assessments of fine-needle aspirations and can help save valuable time for pathologists.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: To assess effect of orthodontic treatment on anterior or lateral functional shift in mixed dentition stage by telemonitoring mandibular movements in four-dimensions using a novel objective method that can assist in orthodontics and other dental specialties without the need of expensive, bulky or complicated equipment.
METHODS: A sample of 60 patients was divided into two groups. Group I included 30 patients with normal occlusion and TMJ functions. Group II included 30 patients that were diagnosed with an abnormal path of closure in antero-posterior or transverse directions due to disharmony between centric occlusion and centric relation. The latter group was orthodontically treated and mandibular movements were measured before, during, directly after orthodontic treatment, and one year after treatment using our proposed method. To evaluate validity and reliability of our method, it was compared with two methods, a commercially available mandibular scanner, and a low-cost graphical method that utilizes a sheet of wax and a stylus.
RESULTS: It was found that the overall differences between opening and closing curves of our proposed method and the other two methods were small and negligible ( p {\textgreater} 0.05).
DISCUSSION: It was found that our proposed method is offering a reasonably accurate, simple and rapid way to telemonitor the mandible movements in four-dimensions using the rear/front camera of any smart-phone.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Proprietary intermediate telehealth devices are those which are specifically designed as connectors between the entities of telehealth systems. This article seeks to understand what are the capabilities of such devices and then to investigate how these are clustered on the current generation of devices.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen current-generation devices available from 12 device providers were selected and analyzed. Four categories of questions were composed to evaluate the devices: setup/configuration, available features, inputs, and outputs.
RESULTS: Data were collected and synthesized on the following capabilities: availability from suppliers, setup, environments of use, multiple-condition monitoring, multiuser capabilities, prompts, reminders and alerts, interaction with the health professional, access to historical data, device inputs, and their transfer technology.
CONCLUSIONS: There are three main roles for proprietary intermediate devices in telehealth systems: displaying information to the patient; receiving data manually/automatically; forwarding results and questionnaire responses to another entity. Provider Perspective: Intermediate devices are usually part of closed proprietary systems. Providers produce disease-customisable devices. Connectivity is considerably ahead of the current generation of point-of-care devices. However, little data are available on connection to rest of the proprietary system. Patient Perspective: It shows clear benefit that one intermediate device can be potentially used with several chronic conditions. Simple setup, authentication procedures, and automatic data transfer are key design aspects. Health Professional Perspective: Little direct interaction with the health professional was observed. Payer Perspective: Details of costs of devices are generally unavailable; system providers indicate that cost variability is based on "user requirements."},

While the risk of stroke may be reduced with advances in prevention, recent advances in acute care can limit the consequences of stroke. In particular, the success of reperfusion therapies including intra-arterial interventions and intravenous administration of thrombolytic agents means that some patients with stroke may be cured. Still, the time window for effective treatment of stroke is relatively short. As a result, modern stroke management requires the close collaboration of the public, health care providers, administrators, insurance companies, and the government. Potential strategies to extend modern stroke care to as many patients as possible include 1) educational programs to train community emergency medical service personnel and physicians, 2) development of stroke care plans at community hospitals, 3) an integrated community-comprehensive stroke center program based on consultation, and telemedicine. The goal is to have a highly integrated approach to provide emergency treatment of the stroke that provides key emergency treatment, including intravenous administration of thrombolytic medications, at a community hospital (primary stroke center) with evacuation to a comprehensive stroke center that has resources and expertise that are not available in the primary stroke center. Taiwan is an ideal location for the development of such regional stroke programs.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To design a "low-cost" tele-imaging method allowing real-time tele-ultrasound expertise, delayed tele-ultrasound diagnosis, and tele-radiology between remote peripherals hospitals and clinics (patient centers) and university hospital centers (expert center).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A system of communication via internet (IP camera and remote access software) enabling transfer of ultrasound videos and images between two centers allows a real-time tele-radiology expertise in the presence of a junior sonographer or radiologist at the patient center. In the absence of a sonographer or radiologist at the patient center, a 3D reconstruction program allows a delayed tele-ultrasound diagnosis with images acquired by a lay operator (e.g., midwife, nurse, technician). The system was tested both with high and low bandwidth. The system can further accommodate non-ultrasound tele-radiology (conventional radiography, mammography, and computer tomography for example). The system was tested on 50 patients between CHR Tsevie in Togo (40 km from Lomé-Togo and 4500 km from Tours-France) and CHU Campus at Lomé and CHU Trousseau in Tours.
RESULTS: A real-time tele-expertise was successfully performed with a delay of approximately 1.5 s with an internet bandwidth of around 1 Mbps (IP Camera) and 512 kbps (remote access software). A delayed tele-ultrasound diagnosis was also performed with satisfactory results. The transmission of radiological images from the patient center to the expert center was of adequate quality. Delayed tele-ultrasound and tele-radiology was possible even in the presence of a low-bandwidth internet connection.

Key drivers for these tools and technologies are the need and interest to collaborate among telehealth stakeholders, including patients, patient communities, research funders, researchers, healthcare services providers, professional societies, industry, healthcare management/economists, and healthcare policy makers. In the development, marketing, adoption, and implementation of these tools and technologies, communication, training, cultural sensitivity, and end-user customization are critical pieces to the process. Next-generation tools and technologies are vehicles toward personalized medicine, extending the telemedicine model to include cell phones and Internet-based telecommunications tools for remote and home health management with video assessment, remote bedside monitoring, and patient-specific care tools with event logs, patient electronic profile, and physician note-writing capability. Telehealth is ultimately a system of systems in scale and complexity. To cover the full spectrum of dynamic and evolving needs of end-users, we must appreciate system complexity as telehealth moves toward increasing functionality, integration, interoperability, outreach, and quality of service. Toward that end, our group addressed three overarching questions: (1) What are the high-impact topics? (2) What are the barriers to progress? and (3) What roles can the National Institutes of Health and its various institutes and centers play in fostering the future development of telehealth?},

Hence, alternate treatment delivery methods are needed. Home-based telehealth (HBT) is one such option; however, this delivery mode has not been compared to in person, clinic-based care for PTSD in adequately powered trials. The present study was designed to compare relative noninferiority of evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD and MD, specifically Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure (BA-TE), when delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic delivery.
METHOD: A repeated measures (i.e., baseline, posttreatment, 3-, 6-month follow-up) randomized controlled design powered for noninferiority analyses was used to compare PTSD and MD symptom improvement in response to BA-TE delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic conditions. Participants were 232 veterans diagnosed with full criteria or predefined subthreshold PTSD.
RESULTS: PTSD and MD symptom improvement following BA-TE delivered by HBT was comparable to that of BA-TE delivered in person at posttreatment and at 3- and 12-month follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD and depression can be safely and effectively delivered via HBT with clinical outcomes paralleling those of clinic-based care delivered in person. HBT, thereby, addresses barriers to care related to both logistics and stigma.},

Results indicated that PE-HBT was non-inferior to PE-IP in terms of reducing PTSD scores at post-treatment, 3 and 6 month follow-up. However, non-inferiority hypotheses for depression were only supported at 6 month follow-up. HBT has great potential to reduce patient burden associated with receiving treatment in terms of travel time, travel cost, lost work, and stigma without sacrificing efficacy. These findings indicate that telehealth treatment delivered directly into patients' homes may dramatically increase the reach of this evidence-based therapy for PTSD without diminishing effectiveness.},

	abstract = {A critical review of evidence was carried out to discover whether the actual performance of telemedicine fulfils the expectations of German policy-makers. The analysis was conducted using the example of telemedicine for congestive heart failure (CHF). It was based on both German and international evidence. The PubMed, MEDLINE, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library databases were searched, as well as public sources from the German Federal Ministry of Health. Forty-five studies reporting patient outcomes, costs or acceptance of telemedicine for CHF were included in the review, of which 28 were interventional. The policy expectations of telemedicine generally are: high technology acceptance and improved patient outcomes at lower costs. However, in the field of CHF, policy-makers underestimate the complexity of telemedicine and the technology has not yet lived up to its expectations. Although some studies show improvements in all-cause mortality and CHF-related hospitalisations, there is excessive study heterogeneity and vagueness in the areas of costs and acceptance. Methodological insufficiencies as well as the scarcity of evidence in the German context do not allow definite conclusions to be drawn. Policy-makers and other stakeholders should increase their efforts to consolidate isolated telemedicine projects, establish guidelines for clinical treatment procedures and economic evaluations, and define industry/technical device standards to enhance the comparability of interventions. Imposing the use of telemedicine on patients and physicians is not likely to be fruitful. A successful adaptation requires an analysis of needs and continuous education on both sides.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Telemonitoring for COPD has gained much attention thanks to its potential of reducing morbidity and mortality, healthcare utilisation and costs. However, its benefit with regard to clinical and economic outcomes remains to be clearly demonstrated.
OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effect of Europe's largest COPD telemonitoring pilot project on direct medical costs, health resource utilisation and mortality at 12 months.
METHODS: We evaluated a population-based cohort using administrative data. Difference-in-difference estimators were calculated to account for time-invariant unobservable heterogeneity after removing dissimilarities in observable characteristics between the telemonitoring and control group with a reweighting algorithm.
RESULTS: The analysis comprised 651 telemonitoring participants and 7047 individuals in the standard care group. The mortality hazards ratio was lower in the intervention arm (HR 0.51, 95 \% CI 0.30-0.86). Telemonitoring cut total costs by 895 € (p {\textless} 0.05) compared to COPD standard care, mainly driven by savings in COPD-related hospitalisations in (very) severe COPD patients (-1056 €, p {\textless} 0.0001). Telemonitoring enrolees used healthcare (all-cause and COPD-related) less intensely with shorter hospital stays, fewer inpatient stays and smaller proportions of people with emergency department visits and hospitalisations (all p {\textless} 0.0001). Reductions in mortality, costs and healthcare utilisation were greater for (very) severe COPD cases.
CONCLUSION: This is the first German study to demonstrate that telemonitoring for COPD is a viable strategy to reduce mortality, healthcare costs and utilisation at 12 months. Contrary to widespread fear, reducing the intensity of care does not seem to impact unfavourably on health outcomes. The evidence offers strong support for introducing telemonitoring as a component of case management.},

The aim of this questionnaire study was to evaluate the effects of telemedicine on patients and medical specialists.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 122 participants (71 patients and 51 doctors) on satisfaction in quality of service, cost-effectiveness, and problems encountered in healthcare provided by the telemedicine in Apollo Tele Health Services, Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The data for each group were calculated and compared.
RESULTS: About 80\% patients and all the doctors reported their satisfaction on the quality of treatment given through telemedicine. Approximately, 90\% of the participants found telemedicine cost-effective and 61\% of the doctors found an increase in patient's inflow apart for their regular practice. Problems encountered in telemedicine were 47\% in technical issues and 39\% in time scheduling by doctors and 31\% of patients were uncomfortable to face the camera, and 24\% had technical issues.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study showed that telemedicine in healthcare could prove to be useful to patients in distant regions and to rural doctors in India. In the near future, telemedicine can be considered as an alternate to face to face patient care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A guide for the implementation of dental digital imaging reports was developed and validated through the International Standard of Health Informatics-Health Level Seven (HL7), achieving interoperability with an electronic system that keeps dental records.
INTRODUCTION: Digital imaging benefits patients, who can view previous close-ups of dental examinations; providers, because of greater efficiency in managing information; and insurers, because of improved accessibility, patient monitoring, and more efficient cost management. Finally, imaging is beneficial for the dentist who can be more agile in the diagnosis and treatment of patients using this tool.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The guide was developed under the parameters of an HL7 standard. It was necessary to create a group of dentists and three experts in information and communication technologies from different institutions.
DISCUSSION: Diagnostic images scanned with conventional radiology or from a radiovisiograph can be converted to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format, while also retaining patient information. The guide shows how the information of the health record of the patient and the information of the dental image could be standardized in a Clinical Dental Record document using international informatics standard like HL7-V3-CDA document (dental document Level 2). Since it is an informatics standardized document, it could be sent, stored, or displayed using different devices-personal computers or mobile devices-independent of the platform used.
CONCLUSIONS: Interoperability using dental images and dental record systems reduces adverse events, increases security for the patient, and makes more efficient use of resources. This article makes a contribution to the field of telemedicine in dental informatics. In addition to that, the results could be a reference for projects of electronic medical records when the dental documents are part of them.},

The proposed system can continuously acquire four different physiological signs, for example, ECG, SpO2, temperature, and blood pressure and further relayed them to an intelligent data analysis scheme to diagnose abnormal pulses for exploring potential chronic diseases. The proposed system also has a friendly web-based interface for medical staff to observe immediate pulse signals for remote treatment. Once abnormal event happened or the request to real-time display vital signs is confirmed, all physiological signs will be immediately transmitted to remote medical server through both cellular networks and internet. Also data can be transmitted to a family member's mobile phone or doctor's phone through GPRS. A prototype of such system has been successfully developed and implemented, which will offer high standard of healthcare with a major reduction in cost for our society.},

Twenty-one adults with social phobia initially received either treatment (i.e. assigned readings in the workbook with limited therapist contact) or were wait-listed. Wait-listed patients eventually received the same self-directed treatment. Results revealed that the self-help/minimal therapist contact treatment was superior to wait-list on most outcome measures. Across the entire sample, reductions in social anxiety, global severity, general anxiety, and depression were observed at posttest and 3-month follow-up. These findings provide preliminary support for using this self-help workbook for individuals with mild to moderate social anxiety in conjunction with infrequent therapist visits to reinforce the treatment principles.

Given the potential temporal and fiscal benefits of telehealth, the Madison VA developed a virtual consultation (VC) mechanism to expedite diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for Veterans with incidentally discovered pulmonary nodules. Materials and.
Methods: VC, a remote encounter between referring provider and thoracic surgeon for incidentally discovered pulmonary nodules, was implemented at the Madison VA between 2009 and 2011. Time from request to completion of consultation, hospital cost, and travel costs were determined for 157 veterans. These endpoints were then compared with in-person consultations over a concurrent 6-mo period.
Results: For the entire study cohort, the mean time to completion of VC was 3.2 d (SD ± 4.4 d). For the 6-mo period of first VC availability, the mean time to VC completion versus in-person consultation was 2.8 d (SD ± 2.8 d) and 20.5 d (SD ± 15.6 d), respectively (p {\textless} 0.05). Following initial VC, 84 (53\%) veterans were scheduled for virtual follow-up alone; no veteran required an additional office visit before further diagnostic or therapeutic intervention. VA hospital cost was \$228 per in-person consultation versus \$120 per episode for VC - a 47.4\% decrease. The average distance form veteran home to center was 86 miles, with an average travel reimbursement of \$112 per in-person consultation, versus no travel cost associated with VC.
Conclusions: VC for incidentally discovered pulmonary nodules significantly decreases time to consultation completion, hospital cost, and veteran travel cost. These data suggest that a significant opportunity exists for expansion of telehealth into additional practice settings within the VA system.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective management of hypertension in chronic kidney disease and renal transplantation is a clinical priority and has societal implications in terms of preserving and optimizing the value of scarce organs. However, hypertension is optimally managed in only 37\% of people with chronic kidney disease, and poor control can contribute to premature graft loss in renal transplant recipients. This article describes a telehealth system that incorporates home electronic blood pressure (BP) monitoring and uploading to a patient portal coupled with a Web-based dashboard that enables clinical pharmacist collaborative care in a renal transplant clinic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The telehealth system was developed and implemented as a quality improvement initiative in a renal transplant clinic in a large, 700-bed, urban hospital with the aim of improving BP in posttransplant patients. A convenience sample of 66 posttransplant patients was recruited by the clinical pharmacist from consecutive referrals to the Transplant Clinic.
RESULTS: Preliminary results show statistically significant reductions in average systolic and diastolic BP of 6.0 mm Hg and 3.0 mm Hg, respectively, at 30 days after enrollment. Two case reports describe the instrumental role of home BP monitoring in the context of medication therapy management.
CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing BP control for both pre- and post-renal transplant patients is likely to benefit society in terms of preserving scarce resources and reducing healthcare costs due to premature graft failure. Connected health systems hold great promise for supporting team-based care and improved health outcomes.},

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested whether a self-motivated, complex eHealth intervention could improve multiple health-related behaviors that are associated with cognitive aging among working Dutch adults.
METHODS: This quasi-experimental prospective study with a pre-post design was conducted with employees of Dutch medium to large companies. All employees with Internet access, a good understanding of the Dutch language, and who provided digital informed consent were eligible to participate. In total, 2972 participants (2110/2972, 71.11\% females) with a mean (standard deviation, SD) age of 51.8 (SD 12.9) years were recruited; 2305 became active users of the intervention, and 173 completed the 1-year follow-up. This self-motivated eHealth lifestyle intervention stimulates participants to set personally relevant, monthly health behavior change goals using Goal Attainment Scaling and to realize these goals by implementing behavior change techniques grounded in behavior change theory. The primary outcomes were the goal-setting success rate and the change in overall lifestyle score from baseline to the 1-year follow-up; the score was based on physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol, sleep, and stress scores. The secondary outcomes were the changes in body weight, body mass index, specific lifestyle characteristics, and website usage.
RESULTS: A total of 1212 participants set 2620 behavior change goals; 392 participants assessed 1089 (1089/2288, 47.59\%) goals and successfully achieved 422 (422/1089, 38.75\%) of these goals. Among the goal-setting participants in follow-up, this led to a +0.81-point improvement (95\% CI 0.49-1.13, P{\textless}.001) in overall lifestyle (d=0.32) and weight loss of 0.62 kg (95\% CI -1.16 to -0.07, P=.03). These participants also showed significant improvement in 8 out of 11 specific lifestyle components.
CONCLUSIONS: Among an adult Dutch population, this eHealth intervention resulted in lifestyle changes in behavioral risk factors associated with cognitive decline, and these improvements lasted over the period of 1 year. Given the general aging of our workforce, this eHealth intervention opens new avenues for the widespread use of cost-effective self-motivated prevention programs aimed at prevention of early-stage cognitive decline and more self-management of their risk factors.

If usage were free, only 45\% of the participants would continue to use it for a long indefinite period of time. If the usage were for a fee, 29\% of the participants would use the service just a few weeks; 28\% would use it an indefinite period of time if they could see its usefulness and if the cost were reasonable. The median amount indicated by the participants as a reasonable monthly fee for such a service was \$5. Although the study did not evaluate perceived usefulness to use the telehealth service explicitly, a benefit perception proved to condition participant willingness to use the service and to pay for it, if necessary. If people perceive usefulness, they want to use the service, even for a fee. A free service would not be used if it is not perceived as beneficial.},

	abstract = {Healthcare systems require a paradigm shift in the way healthcare services are delivered to counteract demographic changes in patient populations, expanding technological developments and the increasing complexity of healthcare. Participatory design (PD) is a methodology that promotes the participation of users in the design process of potential telehealth applications. A PD project can be divided into four phases including: the identification and analysis of participant needs; the generation of ideas and development of prototypes; testing and further development of prototypes; and evaluation. PD is an iterative process where each phase is planned by reflecting on the results from the previous phase with respect to the participants' contribution. Key activities of a PD project include: fieldwork; literature reviewing; and development and testing. All activities must be applied with a participatory mindset that will ensure genuine participation throughout the project. Challenges associated with the use of PD include: the time required to properly engage with participants; language and culture barriers amongst participants; the selection of participants to ensure good representation of the user group; and empowerment. PD is an important process, which is complemented by other evaluation strategies that assess organisational requirements, clinical safety, and clinical and cost effectiveness. PD is a methodology which encourages genuine involvement, where participants have an opportunity to identify practical problems and to design and test technology. The process engages participants in storytelling, future planning and design. PD is a multifaceted assessment tool that helps explore more accurately clinical requirements and patient perspectives in telehealth.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We found that the number of patients requiring wound care consultation was increasing but the distance from our rural campus to the main campus acted as a barrier for timely consultations. Therefore, we implanted a telemedicine program, based on technology manufactured by VISICU (Baltimore, MD) used by intensive care and step-down unit patients in our health system.
PROCESS: A wound consultation was performed with one certified WOC nurse in the remote facility and another certified WOC nurse at the patient's bedside to establish method reliability. Following this assessment of feasibility, we initiated a formal program for remote wound care consultations in March 2009. Fifty remote wound consults have been completed, resulting in an estimated savings of \$5000.
CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence supports telemedicine for remote wound consultations; most literature is based on use of digital camera images or Web cam/computer programs. Our program uses a unique, real-time technology for remote wound care consultations. The potential cost-savings related to decrease in complications of wounds and the positive effects on patient progression and length of stay have not yet been measured. However, our initial experiences suggest that remote consultations using real-time telemedicine reduce delay between request for consultations and its completion, diminish transportation and nonproductive staff time costs, and are comparable to traditional face-to-face consultations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a pilot telehealth program applied to a wide population of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
DESIGN: Vital signs data were transmitted from the home of the patient on a daily basis using a patient monitoring system for review by community nurse to assist decisions on management.
SETTING: Community services for patients diagnosed with COPD.
PARTICIPANTS: Two Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) enrolled 321 patients diagnosed with COPD into the telehealth program. Two hundred twenty-seven (n = 227) patients having a complete baseline record of at least 88 days of continuous remote monitoring and meeting all inclusion criteria were included in the statistical analysis.
INTERVENTION: Remote monitoring.
METHODS: Resource and cost data associated with patient events (inpatient hospitalization, accident and emergency [A\&E], and home visits) 12 months before, immediately before and during monitoring, equipment, start-up, and administration were collected and compared to determine cost-effectiveness of the program.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness of program, impact on resource usage, and patterns of change in resource usage.
RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness was determined for the two PCTs and the two periods before monitoring to provide four separate estimates. Cost-effectiveness had high variance both between the PCTs and between the comparison periods ranging from a saving of £140,800 (\$176,000) to an increase of £9,600 (\$12,000). The average saving was £1,023 (\$1,280) per patient per year. The largest impact was on length of stay with a fall in the average length of inpatient care in PCT1 from 11.5 days in the period 12 months before monitoring to 6.5 days during monitoring, and similarly in PCT2 from 7.5 to 5.2 days.
CONCLUSION: There was a wide discrepancy in the results from the two PCTs. This places doubt on outcomes and may indicate also why the literature on cost-effectiveness remains inconclusive. The wide variance on savings and the uncertainty of monitoring cost do not allow a definitive conclusion on the cost-effectiveness as an outcome of this study. It might well be that the average saving was £1,023 (\$1,280) per patient per year, but the variance is too great to allow this to be statistically significant. Each locality-based clinical service provides a service to achieve the same clinical goal, but it does so in significantly different ways. The introduction of remote monitoring has a profound effect on team learning and clinical practice and thus distorts the cost-effectiveness evaluation of the use of the technology. Cost-effectiveness studies will continue to struggle to provide a definitive answer because outcome measurements are too dependent on factors other than the technology.},

	abstract = {Chronic heart failure (CHF) is an increasingly common condition in high-income countries that has a large and negative impact on life quality and expectancy, and is associated with high financial costs. In Canada, CHF has an especially large impact on rural settings because of the higher proportion of older adults (aged {\textgreater}65 years) in these settings, and because care and outcomes tend to be more adverse in rural parts of the country compared to urban settings. Much can be done to reduce these burdens in terms of pharmacological, behavioural and health service strategies. However, rural patients tend to have worse care and outcomes than urban patients. Realizing the benefits of these strategies in Canada's rural settings requires consideration of underlying reasons for poor care and outcomes. We propose the main reasons for adverse outcomes are related to the nature of CHF and the combined influence of demographics, health services and the rural context. Nurses remain under-used in CHF management in Canada and can play a vital and influential role in reducing the burden of CHF in rural settings. To increase and improve nurses' roles, we recommend that nurses should support the development and adaptation of disease management programs in rural settings and promote the centrality of nursing in these programs. Nurses in or working with rural settings should seek to support and use tele-health technologies effectively and provide better support to lay caregivers. It will also be vital to increase the nursing capacity regarding specialist roles for CHF management.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) independently alters the clinical course of cardiovascular diseases resulting in a significant reduction in all-cause and cardiac mortality. However, only 15\%-30\% of all eligible patients participate in a phase 2 ambulatory programme. The uptake rate of community-based programmes following phase 2 CR and adherence to long-term exercise is extremely poor. Newer care models, involving telerehabilitation programmes that are delivered remotely, show considerable promise for increasing adherence. In this view, the PATHway (Physical Activity Towards Health) platform was developed and now needs to be evaluated in terms of its feasibility and clinical efficacy.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a multicentre randomised controlled pilot trial, 120 participants (m/f, age 40-80 years) completing a phase 2 ambulatory CR programme will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to PATHway or usual care. PATHway involves a comprehensive, internet-enabled, sensor-based home CR platform and provides individualised heart rate monitored exercise programmes (exerclasses and exergames) as the basis on which to provide a personalised lifestyle intervention programme. The control group will receive usual care. Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months after completion of phase 2 of the CR programme. The primary outcome is the change in active energy expenditure. Secondary outcomes include cardiopulmonary endurance capacity, muscle strength, body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, peripheral endothelial vascular function, patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), well-being, mediators of behaviour change and safety. HRQoL and healthcare costs will be taken into account in cost-effectiveness evaluation.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This protocol has been approved by the director and clinical director of the PATHway study and by the ethical committee of each participating site. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed scientific journals and presentations at congresses and events.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most inhabitants in Latin America are concentrated in large urban foci with different access to facilities. Although the main hospitals offer specialized services, economically vulnerable populations cannot easily afford these services, the pediatric population being most affected. This article presents the design and implementation of a low cost telepediatric system, applied to primary care hospitals through a study in Bogotá, Colombia, mainly aimed to reduce the number of unnecessary transfers commonly sent to specialized medical services.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The system was carried out over 6 months with a higher incidence of acute respiratory illness in children between 0 and 5 years in nine primary care hospitals in Bogotá. Nineteen (n = 19) pediatricians were trained by a group of engineers that supports the system permanently. The reduction of patient transfers was compared with previous reports of the National Statistical Department in Colombia.
RESULTS: The system reduced both the number of patient transfers to higher level hospitals by 83\% and the waiting times for patient transfer, improving healthcare in pediatric patients at a reasonable cost, affecting more than 700 patients. At the same time, a decrease of about 17\% in the use of antibiotics was observed, which is an important current public health issue.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of telemedicine improves the efficiency of public health resources, even in big cities such as Bogotá, reducing the number of unnecessary patient transfers and the optimization and appropriate use of medicines.},

Reliability was assessed through use of an in-person collaborator and by assessment of faxed test copies. The MMSE was administered via telehealth with the assistance of a face-to-face collaborator. Patient responses were recorded by both the remote and in-person nurse and compared item by item; total scores for each subject were also compared. Visual items were assessed through a blinded separate scoring of a faxed copy. Percent agreement per item and total score were calculated and correlations between scores were determined by Pearson correlation coefficients. Mean score differences and associated 95\% confidence intervals were calculated. Eighty percent of individual items demonstrated remote to in-person agreement of {\textgreater}95\% and all items were {\textgreater}85.5\% in agreement. Pearson correlation coefficients demonstrated high correlations ({\textgreater}0.86) between 80\% of the items examined. Mean differences in scored test items were not significantly different from zero. This study demonstrates the utility of using telehealth for cognitive assessment by MMSE. It supports the use of telehealth to improve healthcare access among patients for whom distance, cost, and mobility are potential barriers to attending face-to-face clinical visits. Continued validation and reliability testing is warranted to ensure that all healthcare provided via telehealth maintains an equal quality level to that of in-person care.},

A 12-week intervention was evaluated to consider minimization of staff costs in communities where resources are limited.
Research design and methods: A prospective cohort study compared DPP interventions implemented in rural (via telehealth technology) and urban (face-to-face) communities using an intent-to-treat analysis. Primary outcome measures included 5\% and 7\% body weight loss. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine predictors of intervention success and included a variable for treatment effect.
Results: Between 2010 and 2015, up to 667 participants were enrolled in the study representing one urban and 15 rural communities across Montana. The 16-week urban and rural interventions were comparable; 33.5\% and 34.6\% of participants lost 7\% body weight, respectively; 50\% and 47\% lost 5\% (p=0.22). Participants who were male (OR=2.41; 95\% CI 1.32 to 4.40), had lower baseline body mass index (OR=1.03; 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.07), attended more sessions (OR=1.33; 95\% CI 1.11 to 1.58), and more frequently reported (OR=3.84; 95\% CI 1.05 to 14.13) and met daily fat gram (OR=4.26; 95\% CI 1.7 to 10.6) and weekly activity goals (OR=2.46; 95\% CI 1.06 to 5.71) were more likely to meet their 7\% weight loss goal. Predictors of meeting weight loss goals were similar for participants enrolled in the 12-week intervention.
Conclusions: Using telehealth technology to administer a modified DPP to multiple rural communities simultaneously demonstrated weight loss results comparable to those in a face-to-face intervention. Given the limitation of resources, linking rural areas to urban centers using telemedicine may increase access to much needed services to prevent or delay progression to diabetes.},

More than 40 clinical trials and four meta-analytic reviews of EFT treatments have demonstrated large effect sizes with a range of conditions, including pain, PTSD (in both civilian and military veteran populations), phobias, anxiety, and depression. Objective: This review describes the approach, with a focus on PTSD in veterans and service members, provides an overview of how EFT is most commonly applied, and outlines obstacles and cautions related to its implementation. Methods: Peer-reviewed clinical trials and meta-analyses of EFT in the treatment of PTSD are assessed to identify the characteristics of the approach that render it suitable for the treatment of PTSD. Results: The literature demonstrates that remediation of PTSD and comorbid conditions is typically accomplished within brief time frames, ranging from one session for phobias to between four and ten sessions for PTSD. Clinical EFT has been shown to regulate stress hormones and limbic function and to improve various neurologic markers of general health. The epigenetic effects of EFT include upregulation of immunity genes and downregulation of inflammation genes. Six dismantling studies have indicated that the acupressure component of EFT is an active ingredient and not placebo. Conclusions: Seven empirically supported strengths of the approach were identified that make it especially suitable for use with veterans and active military: (1) the depth and breadth of treatment effects; (2) the relatively brief timeframes required for successful treatment; (3) the low risk of adverse events; (4) the minimal training time required for the approach to be applied effectively; (5) the simultaneous reduction of physical and psychologic symptoms; (6) the utility and cost-effectiveness of clinical EFT in a large group format; and (7) the method's adaptability to online and telemedicine applications.},

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review examining care delivered through urology telemedicine clinics over a 6-month period. We examined the urologic conditions, patient satisfaction, and emergency department visits within 30 days of the visit. We estimated patient benefit by calculating travel distance and time and the saved travel-associated costs using Google Maps and US Census income data.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven unique telemedicine visits were conducted and a total of 171 urologic diseases were assessed. The most common conditions were lower urinary tract symptoms (35\%), elevated prostate-specific antigen level (15\%), and prostate cancer (14\%). One patient was seen in the emergency department within 30 days with an unpreventable urologic complaint. Patient satisfaction was "very good" to "excellent" in 95\% of cases, and 97\% would refer another veteran to the urology telemedicine clinic. Patients saved an average of 277 travel miles, 290 minutes of travel time, \$67 in travel expenses, and \$126 in lost opportunity cost.
CONCLUSION: Telemedicine was successfully and safely used to evaluate and treat a wide range of urologic conditions within the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, and saves patients nearly 5 hours and up to \$193 per visit. Further investigation of the potential of telemedicine for the delivery of urologic care in a cost-effective manner is warranted.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To provide a European perspective on reimbursement issues surrounding remote monitoring of cardiac implantable electronic devices in view of the anticipated costs and benefits.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Review of recent literature addressing clinical, economic, sociocultural, and technological factors associated with remote monitoring. When healthcare transformation is urgently needed, remote monitoring offers opportunities to innovate and cope with escalating costs and constrained resources, while improving patient safety, quality, and access to care as reflected in clinical studies. The introduction of remote monitoring into daily practice requires analysis of reimbursement policies to address funding scope, payment method, payer, price and allocation, and alignment with health system objectives and goals to ensure financial and operational sustainability of resources, infrastructure, and processes. Remote monitoring policies should gradually transition from activity-based, added-value services in a care-and-cure setting, to performance and outcome-oriented highlighting prevention, surveillance, and empowerment. By encouraging and rewarding innovation and interoperability, proprietary remote monitoring technologies can open up using standards and connect to support a growing evidence base that guides clinical decision support and planning of future policies.
CONCLUSION: Careful planning, sharing of experiences, and gradual adoption of reimbursement models that focus on outcome, performance, and cost-effectiveness are key aspects of containing escalating costs and improving quality and access to healthcare. Despite differences in health systems and payment methods in Europe, policy-makers, professional societies, payers, providers, and the industry need to join forces to transform healthcare and make innovation happen.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Registry data demonstrate considerably low complication rates after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) procedures for primary prevention of sudden death. Yet standard of care includes postimplant overnight in-hospital observation that may levy substantial unnecessary financial burden on health care systems. In appropriate patients, discharge soon after implant could translate into significant cost savings, if such practice does not result in complications. We applied a simple clinical algorithm to assess feasibility of discharge on the same day of ICD implantation in patients at low risk for procedural complications.
METHODS: We prospectively randomized primary prevention ICD candidates at low risk for complications (not pacing-dependent or requiring bridging heparin anticoagulation) to next-day discharge with overnight in-hospital observation, or same-day discharge with remote monitoring for 24 hours after ICD implant. Implants were performed via cephalic vein access, and randomization occurred after 4-hours clinical observation and device interrogation. All patients were followed for a minimum of 6 weeks to assess acute procedural complications.
RESULTS: 71 patients comprised the study cohort (mean age 62, 79\% male) after 3 were excluded. The most common indication for ICD implant was ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction ≤35\%. Device data obtained through 24-hour remote monitoring was comparable to 4-hour postimplant parameters in same-day discharge patients. No acute complications occurred in same-day discharge patients; 1 next-day discharge patient developed pneumothorax.
CONCLUSION: ICD implantation with same-day discharge is reasonable in patients at low risk for complications. Remote monitoring can be useful in indicating lead-parameter stability during the immediate postoperative period.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A self-constructed questionnaire including 12 questions was designed with five specialists, to improve the design ambiguity. The study was conducted through postal and online survey consisting of 12 questions and sent to 300 histopathologists.
RESULTS: A total of 247 histopathologists answered the survey. The overall response rate was 81\%. 98\% pathologists felt the need for TP and DP. 34\% pathologists used digital photomicrographic images in routine practice. Utilization of DP in most efficient way was observed by 48\% pathologists mainly for the purpose of teaching in academic institutions. 82\% believed that TP is helpful to take an expert opinion whereas only26\% believed that a second opinion has to be taken. With respect to limitations, 67\% pathologists believed that its cost-effective whereas 51\% revealed high use of TP in next 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Our survey shows that as the field evolves, pathologists are more towards welcoming TP and DP, provided frequent workshops and training programs are conducted. The results of this survey indicates that pathology staff across central India currently utilize gross digital images for educational or academic purposes. They also revealed that technology will be required in near future applications in academics, consultation and for medico-legal purposes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pain and depression are prevalent and treatable symptoms among patients with cancer, yet they are often undetected and undertreated. The Indiana Cancer Pain and Depression (INCPAD) trial demonstrated that telecare management can improve pain and depression outcomes. This article investigates the incremental cost effectiveness of the INCPAD intervention.
METHODS: The INCPAD trial was conducted in 16 community-based urban and rural oncology practices in Indiana. Of the 405 participants, 202 were randomized to the intervention group and 203 to the usual-care group. Intervention costs were determined, and effectiveness outcomes were depression-free days and quality-adjusted life years.
RESULTS: The intervention group was associated with a yearly increase of 60.3 depression-free days (S.E. = 15.4; P {\textless} 0.01) and an increase of between 0.033 and 0.066 quality-adjusted life years compared to the usual care group. Total cost of the intervention per patient was US\$1189, which included physician, nurse care manager and automated monitoring set-up and maintenance costs. Incremental cost per depression-free day was US\$19.72, which yields a range of US\$18,018 to US\$36,035 per quality-adjusted life year when converted to that metric. When measured directly, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ranged from US\$10,826 based on the modified EQ-5D to US\$73,286.92 based on the SF-12.
CONCLUSION: Centralized telecare management, coupled with automated symptom monitoring, appears to be a cost effective intervention for managing pain and depression in cancer patients.},

	doi = {10.1089/tmj.2014.0207},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early identification of patients with stroke-induced aphasia is essential because it is a significant disability affecting daily life and is linked to poor functional outcome after stroke. However, most patients with stroke are unable to undergo aphasia evaluation and detection and therefore remain undiagnosed. The purpose of this study is to develop a valid, reliable mobile aphasia screening test (MAST) for patients in remote locations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To accomplish this, we enrolled patients with (n=30) and without (n=30) stroke-induced aphasia. A MAST, which adopted the Korean version of the shortened version of the Frenchay Aphasia Screening Test (K-FAST), was designed as an iPad(®) (Apple, Cupertino, CA) application. To validate the MAST, we compared its performance with that of the Korean version of the Western Aphasia Battery (K-WAB) and conventional shortened FAST paper version (K-FAST). We analyzed interrater and internal reliability, using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and assessed the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and power.
RESULTS: There was significant correlation between K-FAST and MAST (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.995, p{\textless}0.001). MAST also had a high correlation with K-WAB (ICC=0.752, p{\textless}0.001). Interrater reliability was very high (ICC=0.999, p{\textless}0.001). The test had high sensitivity (90.0\%) and specificity (73.3\%) with an accuracy of 0.930 (95\% confidence interval=0.853-1.000). The MAST is a valid and reliable tool for detecting aphasia in patients with stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: This telescreening test may overcome the limitations of test administration and may be a convenient and cost-effective alternative to the existing aphasia screening tests for patients with stroke.},

The purpose of this paper was to report both depression and disability outcomes of telehealth problem-solving therapy (tele-PST via Skype video call) for low-income homebound older adults over 6 months postintervention.
METHODS: A 3-arm randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of tele-PST to in-person PST and telephone care calls with 158 homebound individuals who were aged 50+ and scored 15+ on the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). Treatment effects on depression severity (HAMD score) and disability (score on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule [WHODAS]) were analyzed using mixed-effects regression with random intercept models. Possible reciprocal relationships between depression and disability were examined with a parallel-process latent growth curve model.
RESULTS: Both tele-PST and in-person PST were efficacious treatments for low-income homebound older adults; however the effects of tele-PST on both depression and disability outcomes were sustained significantly longer than those of in-person PST. Effect sizes (dGMA-raw ) for HAMD score changes at 36 weeks were 0.68 for tele-PST and 0.20 for in-person PST. Effect sizes for WHODAS score changes at 36 weeks were 0.47 for tele-PST and 0.25 for in-person PST. The results also supported reciprocal and indirect effects between depression and disability outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and potential low cost of tele-delivered psychotherapy show its potential for easy replication and sustainability to reach a large number of underserved older adults and improve their access to mental health services.},

The physician is also faced with a number of difficult issues when caring for chronic wound patients because their conditions are time consuming and high risk, represent an unprofitable part of care practice and raise issues of liability. Telemedicine enhances communication with the surgical wound care specialist. Digital image for skin lesions is a safe, accurate and cost-effective referral pathway.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to report the methodology and 1-year experience of a regional service model of teleconsultation for planning and treatment of complex thoracoabdominal aortic disease (TAAD).
METHODS: Complex TAADs without a feasible conventional surgical repair were prospectively evaluated by vascular surgeons of the same public health service (National Health System) located in a huge area of 22,994 km2 with 3.7 million inhabitants and 11 tertiary hospitals. Surgeons evaluated computed tomography scans and clinical details that were placed on a web platform (Google Drive; Google, Mountain View, Calif) and shared by all surgeons. Patients gave informed consent for the teleconsultation. The surgeon who submits a case discusses in detail his or her case and proposes a possible therapeutic strategy. The other surgeons suggest other solutions and options in terms of grafts, techniques, or access to be used. Computed tomography angiography, angiography, and clinical outcomes of cases are then presented at the following telemeetings, and a final agreement of the operative strategy is evaluated. Teleconsultation is performed using a web conference service (WebConference.com; Avaya Inc, Basking Ridge, NJ) every month. An inter-rater agreement statistic was calculated, and the κ value was interpreted according to Altman's criteria for computed tomography angiography measurements.
RESULTS: The rate of participation was constant (mean number of surgeons, 11; range, 9-15). Twenty-four complex TAAD cases were discussed for planning and operation during the study period. The interobserver reliability recorded was moderate (κ = 0.41-0.60) to good (κ = 0.61-0.80) for measurements of proximal and distal sealing and very good (κ = 0.81-1) for detection of any target vessel angulation {\textgreater}60 degrees, significant calcification (circumferential), and thrombus presence ({\textgreater}50\%). The concordance for planning and therapeutic strategy among all participants was complete in 16 cases. In one case, the consultation was decisive for creating an innovative therapeutic strategy; in the remaining seven cases, the strategy proposed by the patient's surgeon was changed completely after the discussion. Technical success was the same (100\%) if concordance in planning was present initially or not. Overall 6-month mortality was 4\%, 0\% for those patients with initial concordance in planning vs 12\% for those without initial concordance (P = .33). Surgery was always performed in a tertiary hospital by local surgeons, and in two cases (8\%) external surgeons joined the local surgical team.
CONCLUSIONS: Such a regional service of teleconsultation may be of value in standardizing the treatment and derived costs of complex TAADs in a huge region under the same health provider. The shared decision-making strategy may be of medical-legal value as well.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Telemedicine represents an emerging model for the assessment and management of various neurological disorders.
METHODS: We sought to discuss opportunities and challenges for the integration of telemedicine in the management of common and uncommon neurological disorders by reviewing and appraising studies that evaluate telemedicine as a means to facilitate the access to care, deliver highly specialized visits, diagnostic consultations, rehabilitation, and remote monitoring of neurological disorders.
RESULTS: Opportunities for telemedicine in neurological disorders include the replacement of or complement to in-office evaluations, decreased time between follow-up visits, reduction in disparities in access to healthcare, and promotion of education and training through interactions between primary care physicians and tertiary referral centers. Critical challenges include the integration of the systems for data monitoring with an easy-to-use, secure, and cost-effective platform that is both widely adopted by patients and healthcare systems and embraced by international scientific societies.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple applications may spawn from a model based on digitalized healthcare services. Integrated efforts from multiple stakeholders will be required to develop an interoperable software platform capable of providing not only a holistic approach to care but also one that reduces disparities in the access to care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In 2009, the Departments of Psychiatry and Telehealth of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) initiated a three year project to develop telepsychiatry services in KwaZulu-Natal. This paper describes the challenges and opportunities of this project.
METHOD: This was a collaborative, in situ health service project and an action research framework was adopted. Over the three years, following a needs assessment and an e-health Readiness Assessment, two action research cycles were completed. Cycle 1: The preparation, implementation and evaluation of educational material, technical requirements and clinical guidelines and clinical support materials. Cycle 2: Preparation and evaluation of educational and clinical outreach sessions.
RESULTS: Videoconference education sessions were beneficial to health staff without post-qualification psychiatry training. A flexible format for education improved knowledge outcomes. Clinical sessions are feasible, but require administration and technical support for facilitation. With facilitator training, 128Kbps is a suitable bandwidth for education but 384Kbps is preferred for clinical consultation.
CONCLUSION: Telepsychiatry offers tremendous potential to facilitate the three strategies suggested by the World Psychiatric Association to address the treatment gap, save time and costs and improve access to the small pool of specialist psychiatrists in resource constrained environments.},

However, this entails considerable inconvenience through the need to transport patients and their medical records between hospitals. The development of Telecare Medicine Information Systems (TMIS) makes it easier for patients to seek medical treatment and to store and access medical records. However, medical data stored in TMIS is not encrypted, leaving patients' private data vulnerable to external leaks. In 2014, scholars proposed a new cloud-based medical information model and authentication scheme which would not only allow patients to remotely access medical services but also protects patient privacy. However, this scheme still fails to provide patient anonymity and message authentication. Furthermore, this scheme only stores patient medical data, without allowing patients to directly access medical advice. Therefore, we propose a new authentication scheme, which provides anonymity, unlinkability, and message authentication, and allows patients to directly and remotely consult with doctors. In addition, our proposed scheme is more efficient in terms of computation cost. The proposed system was implemented in Android system to demonstrate its workability.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Telecare has not only brought down medical expenses, but has also become an important tool to address healthcare needs. In recent years, the Taiwanese government has been concerned about this healthcare issue. However, only a few hospitals provide telecare. This study aims at investigating the barriers that healthcare providers face while implementing home telecare in Taiwan.
METHODS: A qualitative research design was employed in this study, with semi-structured in-depth interviews. The sample was obtained from five hospitals, including three medical centers and two regional hospitals. A total of 31 healthcare providers were interviewed, including case managers (n=11), administrators (n=7), physicians (n=7), and nurses (n=6).
RESULTS: The results were summarized into five themes, including: (1) unsuitable laws and vague policies, (2) the policy implementation fails to meet public needs, (3) lack of organizational support, (4) lack of quality and convenience of the system, and (5) inadequate public perception and attitudes.
CONCLUSIONS: Obstacles in policy and regulations are the most fundamental difficulties for telecare implementation, therefore the government should provide a clear direction by planning policies, legislate appropriate regulations, and incorporate telecare into the scope of medical insurance, in order to improve the environment and stimulate the telecare service market. In order to improve the success rate of telecare, administrators should be able to identify an appropriate cost-benefit model to build a humane system to satisfy public needs and to provide staff with resources and support.},

Proactively treating the causes of disablement; physical impairments, pain, and immobility, can prolong functional independence, improve QoL and, potentially, reduce utilization. However rehabilitation service delivery models are reactive in nature and focus on catastrophic rather than incipient disability. A validated collaborative approach, the Three Component Model (TCM), optimizes important clinical outcomes and may provide an ideal framework to overcome barriers to proactively integrating rehabilitation into cancer care. A novel expansion of the TCM that targets disablement by engaging local physical therapists to address physical impairments and immobility, the TCM-Rehabilitation Services (TCM-RS), benefits and is well received by patients. However, its effectiveness has not been rigorously assessed. The 3-arm randomized COllaborative Care to Preserve PErformance in Cancer (COPE) Trial compared: 1) enhanced usual care, 2) rehabilitation services targeting physical impairments and immobility via the TCM-RS, and 3) TCM-RS plus conventional TCM pain management TCM-RS+Pain. Of the 516 participants, those randomized to arms 2 and 3 underwent an initial 4-week intervention period and were then followed for 6months with remote monitoring and monthly telephone calls. The trial's primary outcome, functional status, and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3, and 6months. Utilization was abstracted from clinical records. By estimating the effectiveness and cost-utility implications of the TCM-RS and TCM-RS+Pain, COPE will inform future delivery research, practice and policy in the means to reduce disablement in chronically diseased populations.},

Primary care provider (PCP) bedside assessment for change of condition in SNF patients is believed to improve care and reduce unnecessary hospitalizations, but PCPs are not always available on site in an SNF. This study addresses the potential clinical and financial impacts of an after-hours physician coverage service enabled by technology, TripleCare (TC), to prevent avoidable hospitalizations. TC was launched in a 365-bed SNF in Brooklyn, New York, in March 2015. Outcomes were tracked and evaluated for the initial year. Avoided hospitalizations were identified as such by the covering physicians and confirmed by the facility's medical director. Of the 313 patients cared for by the telemedicine-enabled covering physicians during the year of service, 259 (83\%) were treated on site, including 91 who avoided hospitalizations as verified by a third party, and 54 were transferred to the hospital. It is estimated that the associated cost savings to Medicare and other payers exceeded \$1.55 million, approximately \$500,000 of which went to a managed care Medicare payer, in this 1 SNF during this period. Medicare would annually save \$500,000 in an average 120-bed facility, or \$4167 per bed. Use of a dedicated virtual after-hours physician coverage service in an SNF demonstrated a significant reduction in avoidable hospitalizations.},

This study examined the effectiveness of home-telemonitoring surveillance with nurse coaching for self-management to improve lung cancer outcomes in mountainous Appalachia where health care access/ service is limited. This randomized clinical trial pilot study compared patient outcomes for telemonitoring versus routine care. A convenience sample (N = 47) was enrolled/ randomized (Telemonitored: 26/ Control: 21) from a university hospital and cancer center. Physiologic parameters and symptoms were collected in the telemonitored group for two weeks; all participants were studied for 60 days after the index treatment/ discharge. The telemonitored group showed greater improvement for both functional status (Wald X2 = 3.78, p = .05) and quality of life (QOL) (Wald X2 = 7.25, p = .007) from baseline to 60 days post-discharge. Compared to controls, telemonitored patients survived longer; had more scheduled medical visits (96\% vs. 75\%); made more unplanned calls to doctors/ nurses (32\% vs. 30\% \& 64\% vs. 50\%); had fewer rehospitalizations (28\% vs. 40\%); and had more ER utilization (36\% vs. 30\%). The telemonitored group had relative improvements for health utility (.09 on a scale where 0 = death/ 1= perfect health) and QOL (15 on 0-100 VAS). Differences in health care utilization and cost were not significantly different (p {\textgreater} .05), likely due to the sample size. Telemonitoring group satisfaction with care was high and recommended by patients and caregivers. Results suggest that it is possible to improve patient outcomes with home-telemonitoring for self-management in rural areas. Short-term, telemonitoring-based coaching is feasible and offers a promising option to develop patient self-management knowledge and skills.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The instantaneous spread of information, low costs, and broad availability of information and communication technologies (ICTs) make them an attractive platform for managing care, patient communication, and medical interventions in cancer treatment. There is little information available in Latin America about the level of usage of ICTs for and by cancer patients. Our study attempts to fill this gap.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the level of ICT use and patterns of preferences among cancer patients.
METHODS: We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional survey study in 500 Ecuadorian cancer patients. This questionnaire consisted of 22 items about demographic and clinical data, together with the preferences of people who use ICTs. Chi-square, crude, and adjusted logistic regressions were performed.
RESULTS: Of the total, 43.2\% (216/500) of participants reported that they had access to the Internet, and 25.4\% (127/500) reported that they neither owned a cell phone nor did they have access to the Internet. The Internet constituted the highest usage rate as a source of information about malignant diseases (74.3\%, 162/218) regardless of age (P{\textless}.001). With regard to the preferences on how patients would like to use ICTs to receive information about diseases, WhatsApp (66.5\%, 145/218) and short message service (SMS) text messaging (61.0\%, 133/218) were widely reported as interesting communication channels. Similarly, WhatsApp (72.0\%, 157/218) followed by SMS (63.8\%, 139/218) were reported as the preferred ICTs through which patients would like to ask physicians about diseases. Adjusted regression analysis showed that patients aged between 40 and 64 years were more likely to be interested in receiving information through SMS (odds ratio, OR 5.09, 95\% CI 1.92-13.32), as well as for asking questions to physicians through this same media (OR 9.78, CI 3.45-27.67) than the oldest group.
CONCLUSIONS: WhatsApp, SMS, and email are effective and widely used ICTs that can promote communication between cancer patients and physicians. According to age range, new ICTs such as Facebook are still emerging. Future studies should investigate how to develop and promote ICT-based resources more effectively to engage the outcomes of cancer patients. The widespread use of ICTs narrows the gap between cancer patients with restricted socioeconomic conditions and those with wealth and easily available technological means, thereby opening up new possibilities in low-income countries.},

However, the cost-effectiveness and clinical effect of synchronous telehealth services in older patients with cardiovascular diseases has not yet been studied. Since 2009, the Telehealth Center at the National Taiwan University Hospital has provided a range of telehealth services (led by a cardiologist and staffed by cardiovascular nursing specialists) for cardiovascular disease patients including (1) instant transmission of blood pressure, pulse rate, electrocardiography, oximetry, and glucometry for analysis, (2) mutual telephone communication and health promotion, and (3) continuous analytical and decision-making support.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a synchronous telehealth service on older patients with cardiovascular diseases.
METHODS: Between November 2009 and April 2010, patients with cardiovascular disease who received telehealth services at the National Taiwan University Hospital were recruited. We collected data on hospital visits and health expenditures for the 6-month period before and the 6-month period after the opening of the Telehealth Center to assess the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of telehealth services on cardiovascular patients.
RESULTS: A total of 141 consecutive cardiovascular disease patients were recruited, including 93 aged ≥65 years (senior group) and 48 aged {\textless}65 years (nonsenior group). The telehealth intervention significantly reduced the all-cause admission rate per month per person in the nonsenior group (pretelehealth: median 0.09, IQR 0-0.14; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P=.002) and the duration (days per month per person) of all-cause hospital stay (pretelehealth: median 0.70, IQR 0-1.96; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P{\textless}.001) with increased all-cause outpatient visits per month per person (pretelehealth: median 0.77, IQR 0.20-1.64; posttelehealth: mean 1.60, IQR 1.06-2.57; P=.002). In the senior group, the telehealth intervention also significantly reduced the all-cause admission rate per month per person (pretelehealth: median 0.10, IQR 0-0.18; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P{\textless}.001) and the duration (days per month per person) of all-cause hospital stay (pretelehealth: median 0.59, IQR 0-2.24; posttelehealth: median 0, IQR 0-0; P{\textless}.001) with increased all-cause outpatient visits per month per person (pretelehealth: median 1.40, IQR 0.52-2.63; posttelehealth: median 1.76, IQR 1.12-2.75; P=.02). In addition, telehealth intervention reduced the inpatient cost in the nonsenior group from \$814.93 (SD 1000.40) to US \$217.39 (SD 771.01, P=.001) and the total cost per month from US \$954.78 (SD 998.70) to US \$485.06 (SD 952.47, P{\textless}.001). In the senior group, the inpatient cost per month was reduced from US \$768.27 (SD 1148.20) to US \$301.14 (SD 926.92, P{\textless}.001) and the total cost per month from US \$928.20 (SD 1194.11) to US \$494.87 (SD 1047.08, P{\textless}.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Synchronous telehealth intervention may reduce costs, decrease all-cause admission rates, and decrease durations of all-cause hospital stays in cardiovascular disease patients, regardless of age.},

To increase system effectiveness through customization, we use data from the training strategy developed by the therapist at the clinic for each stroke survivor to drive automated system adaptation at the home. The adaptation includes changing training focus, selecting proper feedback coupling both in real-time and in summary, and constructing appropriate dialogues with the stroke survivor to promote more efficient use of the system.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemedicine has emerged as an innovative platform to diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders in a cost-effective fashion. Previous studies have laid the functional framework for monitoring and treating child psychiatric disorders electronically using videoconferencing, mobile phones (smartphones), and Web-based apps. However, phone call and text message (short message service, SMS) interventions in adolescent psychiatry are less studied than other electronic platforms. Further investigations on the development of these interventions are needed.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to explore the utility of text message interventions in adolescent psychiatry and describe a user feedback-driven iterative design process for text message systems.
METHODS: We developed automated text message interventions using a platform for both depression (EpxDepression) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD; EpxAutism) and conducted 2 pilot studies for each intervention (N=3 and N=6, respectively). The interventions were prescribed by and accessible to the patients' healthcare providers. EpxDepression and EpxAutism utilized an automated system to triage patients into 1 of 3 risk categories based on their text responses and alerted providers directly via phone and an online interface when patients met provider-specified risk criteria. Rapid text-based feedback from participants and interviews with providers allowed for quick iterative cycles to improve interventions.
RESULTS: Patients using EpxDepression had high weekly response rates (100\% over 2 to 4 months), but exhibited message fatigue with daily prompts with mean (SD) overall response rates of 66.3\% (21.6\%) and 64.7\% (8.2\%) for mood and sleep questionnaires, respectively. In contrast, parents using EpxAutism displayed both high weekly and overall response rates (100\% and 85\%, respectively, over 1 to 4 months) that did not decay significantly with time. Monthly participant feedback surveys for EpxDepression (7 surveys) and EpxAutism (18 surveys) preliminarily indicated that for both interventions, daily messages constituted the "perfect amount" of contact and that EpxAutism, but not EpxDepression, improved patient communication with providers. Notably, EpxDepression detected thoughts of self-harm in patients before their case managers or caregivers were aware of such ideation.
CONCLUSIONS: Text-message interventions in adolescent psychiatry can provide a cost-effective and engaging method to track symptoms, behavior, and ideation over time. Following the collection of pilot data and feedback from providers and patients, larger studies are already underway to validate the clinical utility of EpxDepression and EpxAutism.

Hence, the control of access to remote medical servers' resources has become a crucial challenge. A secure authentication scheme between the medical server and remote users is therefore needed to safeguard data integrity, confidentiality and to ensure availability. Recently, many authentication schemes that use low-cost mobile devices have been proposed to meet these requirements. In contrast to previous schemes, Khan et al. proposed a dynamic ID-based remote user authentication scheme that reduces computational complexity and includes features such as a provision for the revocation of lost or stolen smart cards and a time expiry check for the authentication process. However, Khan et al.'s scheme has some security drawbacks. To remedy theses, this study proposes an enhanced authentication scheme that overcomes the weaknesses inherent in Khan et al.'s scheme and demonstrated this scheme is more secure and robust for use in a telecare medical information system.},

The supervisory control system is based on the use of distributed microcontroller architecture to access programmable logic controllers (PLC) and remote input/output devices through the system hardware framework with uniform Ethernet technology. The programmable logic controller (PLC) can access and control devices directly or through RS-232 and RS-485 serial communication. The distributed microcontroller is the control module designated through an open-source firmware, to transform heterogeneous communication to Modbus transmission control protocol (TCP) communication and to achieve the exchange of information between the host and client controller. The proposed supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is based on the professional software of InduSoft Web Studio and provides a supervisory control design with a friendly human⁻machine interface. The system can realize real-time data acquisition and storage, control command transmission, system security and power trend analysis. Finally, the proposed SCADA system can be built directly into the hypertext markup language (HTML) and HTML5 and run on the web server, allowing access from a personal computer or smartphone web browser. Our system goals are to greatly reduce system complexity and maintenance costs with a simple Ethernet architecture. The control system can be easily expanded with the same technology culture outside the restrictive one of the large companies. Hence, this system can easily be used in a smart home system to enhance the quality of its inhabitants.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of an integrated, clinician-focused telehealth monitoring system on the probability of hospitalization within the first 30-day episode of home healthcare.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, nonexperimental design.
METHODS: The study sample includes 2009 data from 5873 Medicare beneficiaries receiving home healthcare services through a network of community-based home health agencies operating in Texas and Louisiana. Propensity-score matching was used to control for selection bias. Logistic regression and postestimation parameter simulation were used to assess how the use of an integrated, clinician-focused telehealth monitoring system might affect the probability of hospitalization during the first 30-day episode of home healthcare.
RESULTS: The 30-day probability of hospitalization for telehealth and non-telehealth patients was 10.3\% and 17.1\%, respectively. Patients in the telehealth group had a 7-percentage-point (95\% confidence interval 4.2, 9.4) lower probability of hospitalization within the first 30-day episode of home healthcare than those in the non-telehealth group.
CONCLUSION: The use of an integrated, clinician focused telehealth monitoring system can substantially reduce the 30-day probability of hospitalization for home healthcare patients. Telehealth monitoring systems that integrate skilled clinicians can lead to substantial hospitalization-related cost savings.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In order to engage medical students and residents from public health centers to utilize the telemedicine features of surgery on their own smartphones and tablets as an educational tool, an innovative streaming system was developed with the purpose of streaming live footage from open surgeries to smartphones and tablets, allowing the visualization of the surgical field from the surgeon's perspective. The current study aims to describe the results of an evaluation on level 1 of Kirkpatrick's Model for Evaluation of the streaming system usage during gynecological surgeries, based on the perception of medical students and gynecology residents.
METHODS: Consisted of a live video streaming (from the surgeon's point of view) of gynecological surgeries for smartphones and tablets, one for each volunteer. The volunteers were able to connect to the local wireless network, created by the streaming system, through an access password and watch the video transmission on a web browser on their smartphones. Then, they answered a Likert-type questionnaire containing 14 items about the educational applicability of the streaming system, as well as comparing it to watching an in loco procedure. This study is formally approved by the local ethics commission (Certificate No. 53175915.7.0000.5171/2016).
RESULTS: Twenty-one volunteers participated, totalizing 294 items answered, in which 94.2\% were in agreement with the items affirmative, 4.1\% were neutral, and only 1.7\% answers corresponded to negative impressions. Cronbach's α was .82, which represents a good reliability level. Spearman's coefficients were highly significant in 4 comparisons and moderately significant in the other 20 comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a local streaming video system of live surgeries to smartphones and tablets and shows its educational utility, low cost, and simple usage, which offers convenience and satisfactory image resolution, thus being potentially applicable in surgical teaching.},

	abstract = {Background The Himachal Pradesh state acute coronary syndrome registry recorded a median delay of 13 h between the time of onset of pain to the time of making the diagnosis and giving treatment for acute coronary syndrome. We conducted a pilot study on providing 24-h tele-electrocardiography (Tele-ECG) services in the district Kangra of Himachal Pradesh, with the aim to reduce the time taken for diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. Methods The intervention group for the study included eight rural community health centres, each with one to three primary care physicians, who were all unskilled in electrocardiogram interpretation. We provided them with 24-h Tele-ECG support. The primary care physicians used their smartphones to transmit the electrocardiogram image to the command centre, which was then read by the skilled specialist physicians in our medical college hospital and the report sent back within five minutes of having received the electrocardiogram. Antiplatelets were given by the primary care physician to patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome, who was then transported to the medical college hospital. The urban sub-divisional hospitals ( n = 6) formed the control group for the study. These hospitals had five to fifteen unskilled primary care physicians and one to two skilled specialist physicians; no intervention was done in this group. A pilot was run from February 2015-January 2016. Results We received 819 Tele-ECG consultations within the intervention group; 157 cases of acute coronary syndrome were confirmed and transferred to our medical college hospital facility. Similarly, we admitted 177 cases of acute coronary syndrome at the medical college hospital, who were first attended to by the primary care physician in the control group. Aspirin was administered to 91\% and 58\% of patients with acute coronary syndrome in the intervention and the control groups, respectively ( p {\textless} 0.0001). The median hospital-to-aspirin time (h) in the intervention and the control groups was 0.7 ± 1.45 h and 3.5 ± 10 h, respectively ( p {\textless} 0.0001). In the intervention group, 72\% of the ST elevation myocardial infarction patients were diagnosed within 12 h by the primary care physician using Tele-ECG support. Interpretation and conclusions Smartphone-based Tele-ECG support for primary care physicians reduced the hospital-to-aspirin time in acute coronary syndrome significantly ( p {\textless} 0.0001). This is an effective low cost strategy and is easily replicable anywhere in the world.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Telemedicine is a useful clinical method to extend health care to patients with limited access. Minimal information exists on the subsequent effect of telemedicine activities on eye care resources.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a community-based diabetic teleretinal screening program on eye care use and resources.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The current study was a retrospective medical record review of patients who underwent diabetic teleretinal screening in the community-based clinics of the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center from October 1, 2008, through March 31, 2009, and who were referred for an ophthalmic examination in the eye clinic.
EXPOSURES: Clinical medical records were reviewed for a 2-year period after patients were referred from teleretinal screening. The following information was collected for analysis: patient demographics, referral and confirmatory diagnoses, ophthalmology clinic visits, diagnostic procedures, surgical procedures, medications, and spectacle prescriptions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The accuracy between referring and final diagnoses and the eye care resources that were used in the care of referred patients.
RESULTS: The most common referral diagnoses were nonmacular diabetic retinopathy (43.2\%), nerve-related disease (30.8\%), lens or media opacity (19.1\%), age-related macular degeneration (12.9\%), and diabetic macular edema (5.6\%). The percentage of agreement among these 5 visually significant diagnoses was 90.4\%, with a total sensitivity of 73.6\%. Diabetic macular edema required the greatest number of ophthalmology clinic visits, diagnostic tests, and surgical procedures. Using Medicare cost data estimates, the mean cost incurred during a 2-year period per patient seen in the eye clinic was approximately \$1000.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although a teleretinal screening program can be accurate and sensitive for multiple visually significant diagnoses, measurable resource burdens should be anticipated to adequately prepare for the associated increase in clinical care.},

The Paris Ile de France Regional Health Agency is currently funding a comprehensive program of telemedicine experiments. This article describes the protocols for the evaluation of the implementation of telemedicine in the Paris region.
METHODS/DESIGN: Over 2,500 patients have been included in eight studies addressing the use of telemedicine in the context of specific diseases or settings. Two projects are randomized controlled trials, while the six other projects are based on before-after designs (differences in differences studies). Based on the MAST model and the French national framework, we identified endpoints to assess the impact of telemedicine on five dimensions: clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, security of the application, patient satisfaction and quality of life and perception of professionals.
DISCUSSION: Telemedicine encompasses a wide range of services and stakeholders, and thus study protocols must be tailored to the specific constraints and interests of the users.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that Diabeo software enabling individualized insulin dose adjustments combined with telemedicine support significantly improves HbA(1c) in poorly controlled type 1 diabetic patients.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a six-month open-label parallel-group, multicenter study, adult patients (n = 180) with type 1 diabetes ({\textgreater}1 year), on a basal-bolus insulin regimen ({\textgreater}6 months), with HbA(1c) ≥ 8\%, were randomized to usual quarterly follow-up (G1), home use of a smartphone recommending insulin doses with quarterly visits (G2), or use of the smartphone with short teleconsultations every 2 weeks but no visit until point end (G3).
RESULTS: Six-month mean HbA(1c) in G3 (8.41 ± 1.04\%) was lower than in G1 (9.10 ± 1.16\%; P = 0.0019). G2 displayed intermediate results (8.63 ± 1.07\%). The Diabeo system gave a 0.91\% (0.60; 1.21) improvement in HbA(1c) over controls and a 0.67\% (0.35; 0.99) reduction when used without teleconsultation. There was no difference in the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes or in medical time spent for hospital or telephone consultations. However, patients in G1 and G2 spent nearly 5 h more than G3 patients attending hospital visits.
CONCLUSIONS: The Diabeo system gives a substantial improvement to metabolic control in chronic, poorly controlled type 1 diabetic patients without requiring more medical time and at a lower overall cost for the patient than usual care.},

METHODS: We piloted our mobile telemedicine system in 2 geographic regions, central Virginia and the San Francisco Bay Area, utilizing commercial cellular networks for videoconferencing transmission. Standardized patients portrayed scripted stroke scenarios during ambulance transport and were evaluated by independent raters comparing bedside to remote mobile telestroke assessments. We used a mixed-effects regression model to determine intraclass correlation of the NIHSS between bedside and remote examinations (95\% confidence interval).
RESULTS: We conducted 27 ambulance runs at both sites and successfully completed the NIHSS for all prehospital assessments without prohibitive technical interruption. The mean difference between bedside (face-to-face) and remote (video) NIHSS scores was 0.25 (1.00 to -0.50). Overall, correlation of the NIHSS between bedside and mobile telestroke assessments was 0.96 (0.92-0.98). In the mixed-effects regression model, there were no statistically significant differences accounting for method of evaluation or differences between sites.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing a low-cost, tablet-based platform and commercial cellular networks, we can reliably perform prehospital neurologic assessments in both rural and urban settings.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study assessed current perspectives and expectations for telemedicine by nursing home caregivers and families of nursing home patients in Taipei, Taiwan.
METHODS: A total of 116 interviews were conducted with family members (n=37) and caregivers (n=79) using an original, four-part questionnaire devised to assess the expectations and concerns related to prospective telemedicine opportunities, including consumer attitude, knowledge of and interest in medicine, concerns and worries about telemedicine, and anticipated benefits of telemedicine.
RESULTS: Statistical significance between the two groups was observed in sex, age, and educational level (all p{\textless}0.001). Most respondents had heard about telemedicine before participation and showed some interest in telemedicine implementation. More than 70.0\% of subjects in both groups had perceptions of telemonitoring of patients, notifications of health abnormalities, teleconferencing between physicians and family members, obtaining test/exam results and face-to-face consultation through telenetworks. Both groups hoped for information and education through telemedicine. More caregivers were concerned about increased costs (p=0.020), poor hardware quality (p{\textless}0.001), poor security, confidentiality, and reliability (p=0.036), inconvenience to patients (p=0.006), associated moral and ethical issues (p=0.006), and uncertainty about responsibility (p=0.022). The two groups did not differ in expectations concerning benefits of telemedicine. More than 60\% of family members or caregivers expected improved efficiency and quality of hospital and nursing home health care, greater rapport between nursing homes and either staff or patients, reduced overall medical costs of caregiving, and reduced staff/caregiver working hours. The acceptable cost was anything up to \$15.30 USD per month.
CONCLUSIONS: Nursing home caregivers and families of nursing home patients are highly interested in telemedicine; however, they are only willing to pay a slightly higher cost of nursing care for this service. The challenge for the future in this industry is to balance peoples' demands and telemedicine's associated costs. Results of this study suggest that caregivers and families of nursing home residents favour telemedicine implementation to provide enhanced care coordination in nursing homes when economic circumstances are favourable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research has outlined the benefits and costs of online health services, but these studies have typically focused on a specific geographic region or disease. Very few studies have estimated consumer demand for online health services.
OBJECTIVE: This study estimated household's willingness to pay (WTP) for the ability to receive remote diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and consultations online (telehealth).
METHODS: WTP was estimated with a random utility model and household data from a US survey employing repeated discrete-choice experiments.
RESULTS: The representative household was willing to pay \$US4.39 per month for telehealth. This valuation increased to \$US5.85 for households with higher opportunity costs, as measured by income, and to \$US6.22 for households living more than 20 miles away from their nearest medical facility.
CONCLUSION: WTP estimates offer insights into the potential benefits from policies intended to promote the expansion of online health services into underserved areas. These include the Federal Communications Commission's Rural Healthcare Pilot Program and the Department of Agriculture's Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grants programme.},

The lack of blood glucose regulation can result in severe diabetes-related complications and substantial healthcare costs, making self-care programs specific to this population especially important. Combined with reduced numbers of healthcare professionals, the integration of healthcare and information technology and the older adults' adoption of telehealth services have become increasingly important. This study used a qualitative method to interview 18 older study participants who used a telehealth service. Subject perceptions and suggestions regarding using such a service for diabetes management were investigated. Content analysis was used to examine the interview data and determine the older patients' acceptance and perceived benefits of telehealth service. Four main themes emerged: (1) initial trial encouragement from the doctors, nurses, and financial incentives; (2) enhanced self-management capability through continuous device use for better outcomes; (3) ambivalent feelings regarding dependence on others for problem solving; and (4) consideration for continual technology use for an uncertain future. These results serve as a reference for promoting, assessing, and verifying telehealth models for older patients with diabetes.},

Photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensors generally require {\textgreater}10 components, occupy an area {\textgreater}300 mm(2), consume {\textgreater}10 mW power, and cost {\textgreater}\$20 USD. Although the principle of PPG sensing is straightforward, in practice, a robust implementation requires a careful design including optical alignment, analog circuits, ambient light cancellation, and power management. This paper reports the first use of digital optical proximity sensors (OPS) for "plug-and-play" PPG. OPS have traditionally been used for distance sensing in smartphones and factory automation. Here we show that a digital OPS can perform PPG functions in a single 4×4 mm package which also provides a direct digital interface to a microcontroller. By exploiting its key features, a digital OPS can provide substantial performance advantages over existing state-of-the-art PPGs, including: i) 10X lower power consumption (200 µW) due to pulse operation; ii) high signal to noise ratio ({\textgreater}90), as a result of built-in optical barriers, filters, and ambient light cancellation; iii) 10X lower cost (\$2 USD); and iv) 12X smaller area. We show single wavelength PPG measurements in multiple anatomical locations, including fingertips and earlobes. The results suggest that a digital OPS can provide an elegant solution for battery-powered, wearable physiological monitors. To the authors' knowledge, this is the smallest and lowest power PPG sensor reported to date.},

The study aimed to explore the benefits of an online Symptom Care and Management System in the home for patients receiving chemotherapy. A single-group experimental design was used. Thirty patients aged between 37 and 77 years undergoing their first or commencing a new course of chemotherapy treatment were recruited from November 2010 and December 2012 at a cancer center in Singapore. All patients used the Symptom Care and Management System to send daily symptom reports to the cancer center and received symptom management advice from the oncology nurse via teleconferencing during the first four chemotherapy treatment cycles. Patients' perceptions of the use of the Symptom Care and Management System were evaluated. All participants perceived the Symptom Care and Management System as a user-friendly interface and believed that they felt more involved in their care, and the system made it easier to understand some of the problems they experienced and helped them manage the symptoms more easily during the treatment. In addition, 29 participants (96.7\%) felt that the nurse could contact them better via the Symptom Care and Management System, the Symptom Care and Management System helped them explain their symptoms to the nurse, and that it was simple to understand. The results presented in this study suggested that the Symptom Care and Management System has the potential to enhance remote monitoring and provides a feasible and acceptable way for a specific group of cancer patients to manage their symptoms at home.},

	abstract = {Non-attendance represents a significant cost to many health systems, resulting in inefficiency, wasted resources, poorer service delivery and lengthened waiting queues. Past studies have considered extensively the reasons for non-attendance and have generally concluded that the use of reminder systems is effective. Despite this, there will always be a certain level of non-attendance arising from unforeseeable and unpreventable circumstances, such as illness or accidents, leading to unfilled appointments. This paper reviews current approaches to the non-attendance problem, and presents a high-level approach to fill last minute appointments arising out of unforeseeable non-attendance. However, no single approach will work for all clinics and implementation of these ideas must occur at a local level. These approaches include use of social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook, as a communication tool in order to notify prospective patients when last-minute appointments become available. In addition, teleconsultation using video-conferencing technologies would be suitable for certain last-minute appointments where travel time would otherwise be inhibiting. Developments of new and innovative technologies and the increasing power of social media, means that zero non-attendance is now an achievable target. We hope that this will lead to more evidence-based evaluations from the implementation of these strategies in various settings at a local level.},

	abstract = {The analysis of lung sounds, collected through auscultation, is a fundamental component of pulmonary disease diagnostics for primary care and general patient monitoring for telemedicine. Despite advances in computation and algorithms, the goal of automated lung sound identification and classification has remained elusive. Over the past 40 years, published work in this field has demonstrated only limited success in identifying lung sounds, with most published studies using only a small numbers of patients (typically N{\textless};20) and usually limited to a single type of lung sound. Larger research studies have also been impeded by the challenge of labeling large volumes of data, which is extremely labor-intensive. In this paper, we present the development of a semi-supervised deep learning algorithm for automatically classify lung sounds from a relatively large number of patients (N=284). Focusing on the two most common lung sounds, wheeze and crackle, we present results from 11,627 sound files recorded from 11 different auscultation locations on these 284 patients with pulmonary disease. 890 of these sound files were labeled to evaluate the model, which is significantly larger than previously published studies. Data was collected with a custom mobile phone application and a low-cost (US\$30) electronic stethoscope. On this data set, our algorithm achieves ROC curves with AUCs of 0.86 for wheeze and 0.74 for crackle. Most importantly, this study demonstrates how semi-supervised deep learning can be used with larger data sets without requiring extensive labeling of data.},

Smartphones and mobile phone networks are widespread, and could be used for diagnostic imaging and telemedicine.

The aim of this study was to compare the microscopic assessment of MS in liver allograft biopsies by a smartphone with eyepiece adaptor (BLIPS device) to standard light microscopy. Forty liver graft biopsies were evaluated in transmitted light, using an Iphone 5s and 4 different mini-objective, add-on lenses. A significant correlation was reported between the two different approaches for graft MS assessment (Spearman's correlation coefficient: rs  = 0.946; p {\textless} .001). Smartphone with eyepiece adaptor had similar discriminatory power to identify MS in liver grafts than standard light microscopy. Based on these findings, a smartphone integrated with a low-cost eyepiece adaptor can achieve adequate accuracy in the assessment of MS in liver graft, and could be used as an alternative to standard light microscope when unavailable.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telehealth services based on at-home monitoring of vital signs and the administration of clinical questionnaires are being increasingly used to manage chronic disease in the community, but few statistically robust studies are available in Australia to evaluate a wide range of health and socio-economic outcomes. The objectives of this study are to use robust statistical methods to research the impact of at home telemonitoring on health care outcomes, acceptability of telemonitoring to patients, carers and clinicians and to identify workplace cultural factors and capacity for organisational change management that will impact on large scale national deployment of telehealth services. Additionally, to develop advanced modelling and data analytics tools to risk stratify patients on a daily basis to automatically identify exacerbations of their chronic conditions.
METHODS/DESIGN: A clinical trial is proposed at five locations in five states and territories along the Eastern Seaboard of Australia. Each site will have 25 Test patients and 50 case matched control patients. All participants will be selected based on clinical criteria of at least two hospitalisations in the previous year or four or more admissions over the last five years for a range of one or more chronic conditions. Control patients are matched according to age, sex, major diagnosis and their Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA). The Trial Design is an Intervention control study based on the Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design.
DISCUSSION: Our preliminary data indicates that most outcome variables before and after the intervention are not stationary, and accordingly we model this behaviour using linear mixed-effects (lme) models which can flexibly model within-group correlation often present in longitudinal data with repeated measures. We expect reduced incidence of unscheduled hospitalisation as well as improvement in the management of chronically ill patients, leading to better and more cost effective care. Advanced data analytics together with clinical decision support will allow telehealth to be deployed in very large numbers nationally without placing an excessive workload on the monitoring facility or the patient's own clinicians.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemonitoring is becoming increasingly important for the management of patients with chronic conditions, especially in countries with large distances such as Australia. However, despite large national investments in health information technology, little policy work has been undertaken in Australia in deploying telehealth in the home as a solution to the increasing demands and costs of managing chronic disease.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this trial was to evaluate the impact of introducing at-home telemonitoring to patients living with chronic conditions on health care expenditure, number of admissions to hospital, and length of stay (LOS).
METHODS: A before and after control intervention analysis model was adopted whereby at each location patients were selected from a list of eligible patients living with a range of chronic conditions. Each test patient was case matched with at least one control patient. Test patients were supplied with a telehealth vital signs monitor and were remotely managed by a trained clinical care coordinator, while control patients continued to receive usual care. A total of 100 test patients and 137 control patients were analyzed. Primary health care benefits provided to Australian patients were investigated for the trial cohort. Time series data were analyzed using linear regression and analysis of covariance for a period of 3 years before the intervention and 1 year after.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between test and control patients at baseline. Test patients were monitored for an average of 276 days with 75\% of patients monitored for more than 6 months. Test patients 1 year after the start of their intervention showed a 46.3\% reduction in rate of predicted medical expenditure, a 25.5\% reduction in the rate of predicted pharmaceutical expenditure, a 53.2\% reduction in the rate of predicted unscheduled admission to hospital, a 67.9\% reduction in the predicted rate of LOS when admitted to hospital, and a reduction in mortality of between 41.3\% and 44.5\% relative to control patients. Control patients did not demonstrate any significant change in their predicted trajectory for any of the above variables.
CONCLUSIONS: At-home telemonitoring of chronically ill patients showed a statistically robust positive impact increasing over time on health care expenditure, number of admissions to hospital, and LOS as well as a reduction in mortality.

Nevertheless, many areas of Romania are still lacking qualified medical personnel that can perform vital surgeries thus requiring patients to travel long distances to obtain the health care services they require. In order to improve the current healthcare infrastructure and eliminate the difficulties associated with a lack of qualified medical personnel in rural areas of the country, this article suggests the implementation of telesurgery as a practical solution. This article will hope to analyze the applicability of telesurgery by looking at the benefits and costs of creating a national telesurgery infrastructure, by predicting possible obstacles in creating such a system and by suggesting ways in which these obstacles can be avoided. The writing of this article was possible thanks to interviews, articles, and data obtained from surgeons and medical personnel that practice in Romania, the Republic of Moldova, Canada, and the United States of America. A vast majority of technical details has been furnished by the producers of robotic surgery platforms such as Intuitive Surgical®.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is one of the most important medical and public health problems of our time: it increases the risk of many health complications such as hypertension, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes, needs long-lasting treatment for effective results and involves high public and private costs. Therefore, it is imperative that enduring and low-cost clinical programs for obesity and related co-morbidities are developed and evaluated.
METHODS/DESIGN: TECNOB (TEChnology for OBesity) is a comprehensive two-phase stepped down program enhanced by telemedicine for the long-term treatment of obese people with type 2 diabetes seeking intervention for weight loss. Its core features are the hospital-based intensive treatment (1-month), that consists of diet therapy, physical training and psychological counseling, and the continuity of care at home using new information and communication technologies (ICT) such as internet and mobile phones. The effectiveness of the TECNOB program compared with usual care (hospital-based treatment only) will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome is weight in kilograms. Secondary outcome measures are energy expenditure measured using an electronic armband, glycated hemoglobin, binge eating, self-efficacy in eating and weight control, body satisfaction, healthy habit formation, disordered eating-related behaviors and cognitions, psychopathological symptoms and weight-related quality of life. Furthermore, the study will explore what behavioral and psychological variables are predictive of treatment success among those we have considered.
DISCUSSION: The TECNOB study aims to inform the evidence-based knowledge of how telemedicine may enhance the effectiveness of clinical interventions for weight loss and related type-2 diabetes, and which type of obese patients may benefit the most from such interventions. Broadly, the study aims also to have a effect on the theoretical model behind the traditional health care service, in favor of a change towards a new "health care everywhere" approach.},

Therefore, it is imperative that enduring and low-cost clinical programs for obesity and related co-morbidities are developed and evaluated. Information and communication technologies (ICT) can help clinicians to deliver treatment in a cost-effective and time-saving manner to a large number of obese individuals with co-morbidities.
OBJECTIVE: To examine ad interim effectiveness of a 12-month multidisciplinary telecare intervention for weight loss provided to obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A single-center randomized controlled trial (TECNOB study) started in December 2008. At present, 72 obese patients with type 2 diabetes have been recruited and randomly allocated to the TECNOB program (n=37) or to a control condition (n=39). However, only 34 participants have completed at least the 3-month follow-up and have been included in this ad interim analysis. 21 out of them have reached also the 6-month follow-up and 13 have achieved the end of the program. Study is still on-going.
INTERVENTION: All participants attended 1-month inpatient intensive program that involved individualized medical care, diet therapy, physical training and brief psychological counseling. At discharge, participants allocated to the TECNOB program were instructed to use a weight-loss web-site, a web-based videoconference tool, a dietary software installed into their cellular phones and an electronic armband measuring daily steps and energy expenditure.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight and disordered eating-related behaviors and cognitions (EDI-2) at entry to hospital, at discharge from hospital, at 3,6 and 12 months.
RESULTS: Ad interim analysis of data from 34 participants showed no statistically significant difference between groups in weight change at any time-point. However, within-group analysis revealed significant reductions of initial weight at discharge from hospital, at 3 months, at 6 months but not at 12 months. Control group had higher scores in Interpersonal distrust at 12 months.
CONCLUSION: This ad interim findings revealed that the effect of the inpatient treatment was high and probably overwhelmed the effect of the TECNOB intervention. Much statistical power and long-term follow-up may enhance the probability to detect the TECNOB effect over and above the great one exerted by the inpatient program.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are linked with binge eating disorder (BED). Effective interventions to significantly reduce weight, maintain weight loss and manage associated pathologies like BED are typically combined treatment options (dietetic, nutritional, physical, behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, pharmacological, surgical). Significant difficulties with regard to availability, costs, treatment adherence and long-term efficacy are present. Particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the therapeutic approach indicated both in in-patient and in out-patient settings for BED. In recent years systemic and systemic-strategic psychotherapies have been implemented to treat patients with obesity and BED involved in familiar problems. Particularly a brief protocol for the systemic-strategic treatment of BED, using overall the strategic dialogue, has been recently developed. Moreover telemedicine, a new promising low cost method, has been used for obesity with BED in out-patient settings in order to avoid relapse after the in-patient step of treatment and to keep on a continuity of care with the involvement of the same clinical in-patient team.
METHODS: The comparison between CBT and Brief Strategic Therapy (BST) will be assessed in a two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial. Due to the novelty of the application of BST in BED treatment (no other RCTs including BST have been carried out), a pilot study will be carried out before conducting a large scale randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Both CBT and BST group will follow an in-hospital treatment (diet, physical activity, dietitian counseling, 8 psychological sessions) plus 8 out-patient telephone-based sessions of psychological support and monitoring with the same in-patient psychotherapists. Primary outcome measure of the randomized trial will be the change in the Global Index of the Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45.2). Secondary outcome measures will be the percentage of BED patients remitted considering the number of weekly binge episodes and the weight loss. Data will be collected at baseline, at discharge from the hospital (c.a. 1 month after) and after 6-12-24 months from the end of the in-hospital treatment. Data at follow-up time points will be collected through tele-sessions.
DISCUSSION: The STRATOB (Systemic and STRATegic psychotherapy for OBesity), a comprehensive two-phase stepped down program enhanced by telepsychology for the medium-term treatment of obese people with BED seeking intervention for weight loss, will shed light about the comparison of the effectiveness of the BST with the gold standard CBT and about the continuity of care at home using a low-level of telecare (mobile phones).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a strong policy drive towards implementing alternatives to face-to-face consultations in general practice to improve access, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. These alternatives embrace novel technologies that are assumed to offer potential to improve care.
AIM: To explore the introduction of one online consultation system (Tele-Doc) and how it shapes working practices.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Mixed methods case study in an inner-city general practice.
METHOD: The study was conducted through interviews with IT developers, clinicians, and administrative staff, and scrutiny of documents, websites, and demonstrator versions of Tele-Doc, followed by thematic analysis and discourse analysis.
RESULTS: Three interrelated themes were identified: online consultation systems as innovation, managing the 'messiness' of general practice consultations, and redistribution of the work of general practice. These themes raise timely questions about what it means to consult in contemporary general practice. Uptake of Tele-Doc by patients was low. Much of the work of the consultation was redistributed to patients and administrators, sometimes causing misunderstandings. The 'messiness' of consultations was hard to eliminate. In-house training focused on the technical application rather than associated transformations to practice work that were not anticipated. GPs welcomed varied modes of consulting, but the aspiration of improved efficiency was not realised in practice.
CONCLUSION: Tele-Doc offers a new kind of consultation that is still being worked out in practice. It may offer convenience for patients with discrete, single problems, and a welcome variation to GPs' workload. Tele-Doc's potential for addressing more complex problems and achieving efficiency is less clear, and its adoption may involve unforeseeable consequences.},

	doi = {10.5195/IJT.2012.6105},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early intervention (EI) services are designed to promote the development of skills and enhance the quality of life of infants and toddlers who have been identified as having a disability or developmental delay, enhance capacity of families to care for their child with special needs, reduce future educational costs, and promote independent living (NECTAC, 2011). EI services are regulated by Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA); however, personnel shortages, particularly in rural areas, limit access for children who qualify. Telehealth is an emerging delivery model demonstrating potential to deliver EI services effectively and efficiently, thereby improving access and ameliorating the impact of provider shortages in underserved areas. The use of a telehealth delivery model facilitates inter-disciplinary collaboration, coordinated care, and consultation with specialists not available within a local community.
METHOD: A survey sent by the National Early Childhood Technical Assistance Center (NECTAC) to IDEA Part C coordinators assessed their utilization of telehealth within states' IDEA Part C programs. Reimbursement for provider type and services and barriers to implement a telehealth service delivery model were identified.
RESULTS: Representatives from 26 states and one jurisdiction responded to the NECTAC telehealth survey. Of these, 30\% (n=9) indicated that they are either currently using telehealth as an adjunct service delivery model (n=6) or plan to incorporate telehealth within the next 1-2 years (n=3). Identified telehealth providers included developmental specialists, teachers of the Deaf/Hard of Hearing (DHH), speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, behavior specialists, audiologists, and interpreters. Reimbursement was variable and included use of IDEA Part C funding, Medicaid, and private insurance. Expressed barriers and concerns for the implementation of telehealth as a delivery model within Part C programming included security issues (40\%; n=11); privacy issues (44\%; n=12); concerns about quality of services delivered via telehealth (40\%; n=11); and lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of a telehealth service delivery model within IDEA Part C programming (3\%; n=1). Reimbursement policy and billing processes and technology infrastructure were also identified as barriers impacting the implementation of telehealth programming.
CONCLUSIONS: Provider shortages impact the quantity and quality of services available for children with disabilities and developmental delay, particularly in rural areas. While many states are incorporating telehealth within their Early Intervention (IDEA Part C) services in order to improve access and overcome personnel shortages, barriers persist. Policy development, education of stakeholders, research, utilization of secure and private delivery platforms, and advocacy may facilitate more widespread adoption of telehealth within IDEA Part C programs across the country.},

Families completed questionnaires about clinical management before the addition of telemedicine and 2-3 months after they had used telemedicine. They also completed a questionnaire about their experience with videoconferencing. There were 27 telemedicine encounters during the 9-month study. Families reported higher confidence in clinical care with telemedicine compared to telephone. They also reported that the videoconferencing was high-quality, easy to use, and did not increase their telecommunication costs. The telemedicine encounters supported clinical decision-making, especially in patients with active clinical problems or when the patient was acutely ill. The telemedicine encounters prevented the need for 23 clinic visits, three emergency room visits, and probably one hospital admission. Although the study was small, videoconferencing appears useful in the management of medically fragile patients on home ventilator support, producing high levels of family confidence in clinical management and value to clinicians in their decision-making.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postnatal depression (PND) can be experienced by 13\% of women who give birth, and such women often exhibit disabling symptoms, which can have a negative effect on the mother and infant relationship, with significant consequences in terms of the child's later capacity for affect regulation. Research has shown that providing support to mothers experiencing PND can help reduce their depressive symptoms and improve their coping strategies. The Mums4Mums study aims to evaluate the impact of telephone peer-support for women experiencing PND.
METHODS/DESIGN: The study design adopts the MRC framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. Health visitors in Warwickshire and Coventry Primary Care Trusts are screening potential participants at the 8-week postnatal check using either the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS {\textgreater} = 10) or the three Whooley questions recommended by NICE (http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG45). The Mums4Mums telephone support intervention is being delivered by trained peer-supporters over a period of four months. The primary outcome is depressive symptomatology as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes include mother-child interaction, dyadic adjustment, parenting sense of competence scale, and self-efficacy. Maternal perceptions of the telephone peer-support are being assessed using semi-structured interviews following the completion of the intervention.
DISCUSSION: The proposed study will develop current innovative work in peer-led support interventions and telecare by applying existing expertise to a new domain (i.e. PND), testing the feasibility of a peer-led telephone intervention for mothers living with PND, and developing the relationship between the lay and clinical communities. The intervention will potentially benefit a significant number of patients and support a future application for a larger study to undertake a full evaluation of the clinical and cost effectiveness of telephone based peer-support for PND.

Telemedicine is an economical and effective way to address this problem. In this research, we developed a framework for real-time communication during ultrasound examination that combines interaction via standard video conference protocols and basic AR functionalities (commercial) and a custom-developed application. The tele-ultrasonographic platform has been installed in a rural hospital in the Tuscan Apennines, and was tested on 12 patients. The study explores the utility of the system from the local and remote clinician perspectives. The results obtained provide valuable insight: the platform and the telemedicine paradigm can reduce the costs related to the necessity to move critical patients when there is a need for a specialist second opinion. Moreover, the possibility of having an expert guiding and commenting on the fly the diagnostic examination has also a didactic power, and thus allows the local less specialized clinicians to grow in competencies over time.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The assessment of a new health technology is a multidisciplinary and multidimensional process, which requires a complex analysis and the convergence of different stakeholders into a common decision. This task is even more delicate when the assessment is carried out in early stage of development processes, when the maturity of the technology prevents conducting a large scale trials to evaluate the cost effectiveness through classic health economics methods. This lack of information may limit the future development and deployment in the clinical practice. This work aims to 1) identify the most relevant user needs of a new medical technology for managing and monitoring Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients and to 2) use these user needs for a preliminary assessment of a specific system called PERFORM, as a case study.
METHODS: Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to design a hierarchy of 17 needs, grouped into 5 categories. A total of 16 experts, 6 of them with a clinical background and the remaining 10 with a technical background, were asked to rank these needs and categories.
RESULTS: On/Off fluctuations detection, Increase wearability acceptance, and Increase self-management support have been identified as the most relevant user needs. No significant differences were found between the clinician and technical groups. These results have been used to evaluate the PERFORM system and to identify future areas of improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: First of all, the AHP contributed to the elaboration of a unified hierarchy, integrating the needs of a variety of stakeholders, promoting the discussion and the agreement into a common framework of evaluation. Moreover, the AHP effectively supported the user need elicitation as well as the assignment of different weights and priorities to each need and, consequently, it helped to define a framework for the assessment of telehealth systems for PD management and monitoring. This framework can be used to support the decision-making process for the adoption of new technologies in PD.},

As well as improving cost effectiveness, such an approach could be used to help individuals live at home for longer. In practice however, these devices often go unused. A qualitative study was carried out to determine the barriers to uptake of these devices from both the perspective of the end user and from key players in the healthcare supply chain.
METHODS: A qualitative approach was used involving focus groups and interviews. Two UK-based focus groups were held with users and potential users, to assess their views on the wide array of devices available. 27 individuals were involved in the groups, all over the age of 60. Additionally 27 telephone interviews were conducted with key supply chain players to ascertain their views on the barriers to uptake of these devices. A semi-structured interview guide was used. All data were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic approach.
RESULTS: Users were generally unaware of the wide array of devices available and when shown a selection, were often unclear as to their purpose. The interviews revealed extensive barriers to uptake due to lack of awareness, unfamiliar terminology, complex supply routes and costs, resistance from professionals to device usage and lack of expertise.
CONCLUSIONS: Public and professional awareness campaigns are required with appropriate funding mechanisms for users to gain access to devices. The numerous barriers identified require systematically addressing, so that device usage is better promoted, enabling individuals to live at home successfully for longer.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Few data are available on actual follow-up costs of remote monitoring (RM) of implantable defibrillators (ICD). Our study aimed at assessing current direct costs of 1-year ICD follow-up based on RM compared with conventional quarterly in-hospital follow-ups.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (N = 233) with indications for ICD were consecutively recruited and randomized at implant to be followed up for 1 year with standard quarterly in-hospital visits or by RM with one in-hospital visit at 12 months, unless additional in-hospital visits were required due to specific patient conditions or RM alarms. Costs were calculated distinguishing between provider and patient costs, excluding RM device and service cost. The frequency of scheduled in-hospital visits was lower in the RM group than in the control arm. Follow-up required 47 min per patient/year in the RM arm versus 86 min in the control arm (p = 0.03) for involved physicians, generating cost estimates for the provider of USD 45 and USD 83 per patient/year, respectively. Costs for nurses were comparable. Overall, the costs associated with RM and standard follow-up were USD 103 ± 27 and 154 ± 21 per patient/year, respectively (p = 0.01). RM was cost-saving for the patients: USD 97 ± 121 per patient/year in the RM group versus 287 ± 160 per patient/year (p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The time spent by the hospital staff was significantly reduced in the RM group. If the costs for the device and service are not charged to patients or the provider, patients could save about USD 190 per patient/year while the hospital could save USD 51 per patient/year.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The primary objective of this project was to examine the effectiveness of an Internet-based smoking cessation intervention combined with a tele-health medication clinic for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) compared to referral to clinic-based smoking cessation care.
METHODS: A total of 413 patients were proactively recruited from the Durham VA Medical Center and followed for 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive either a referral to VA specialty smoking cessation care (control) or to the Internet intervention and tele-health medication clinic. Primary outcomes included (1) intervention reach, (2) self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates at 3 months and 12 months, and 3) relative cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Reach of the Internet intervention and use of smoking cessation aids were significantly greater compared to the control. At 3 months-post randomization, however, there were no significant differences in quit rates: 17\% (95\% CI: 12\%–23\%) in the Internet-based intervention compared to 12\% (95\% CI: 8\%–17\%) in the control arm. Similarly, there were no differences in quit rates at 12 months (13\% vs. 16\%). While costs associated with the Internet arm were higher due to increased penetration and intensity of NRT use, there were no statistically significant differences in the relative cost effectiveness (e.g., life years gained, quality adjusted life years) between the two arms.
CONCLUSIONS: Current results suggest that using an electronic medical record to identify smokers and proactively offering smoking cessation services that are consistent with US Public Health Guidelines can significantly reduce smoking in veterans. Novel interventions that increase the reach of intensive treatment are needed to maximize quit rates in this population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extensive uptake of mobile phones offers an unprecedented opportunity to improve global healthcare delivery, especially among underserved populations. Mobile health (mHealth) has been increasingly recognized as a promising approach to addressing challenges in global maternal-child health and may play an important role in accelerating progress towards improved outcomes. However, more evidence guiding development of mHealth interventions is needed. The current study explores factors that may support or hinder adoption and use of a proposed mHealth intervention to improve caregiver home management of common childhood illnesses in order to shape program development.
METHODS: Elicitation interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of 25 mothers recruited from a larger cluster-randomized survey sample in the Cono Norte region of Arequipa, Peru. Interview data were analyzed in Spanish to preserve important cultural nuances.
RESULTS: Thematic analysis revealed potential facilitators of and barriers to uptake of the proposed mHealth program. Potential facilitators of caregiver participation include opportunity to engage in two-way communication with healthcare providers, development of instrumental and support knowledge to care for sick children, and healthcare challenges faced in a resource-poor community. Potential barriers include preference for in-person healthcare visits, program cost, text messaging abilities, and concern around program legitimacy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the potential for mHealth to improve global healthcare delivery in the area of maternal-child health. It demonstrates that mHealth interventions can meet the needs of vulnerable populations by offering novel approaches to promoting evidence-based care. This in-depth understanding of factors that may influence participation and use of this proposed mHealth program will help shape development of the intervention in this community.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Flare-ups in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are characterized by joint pain and swelling and often accompanied with fatigue, negative emotions, and reduced participation in activities. To minimize the impact of JIA on the physical and psychosocial development and well-being of young people (YP), it is essential to regularly monitor disease activity and side effects, as well as to support self-management such as adherence to treatment plans and engagement in general health-promoting behaviors. Smartphone technology has the potential to engage YP with their health care through convenient self-monitoring and easy access to information. In addition, having a more accurate summary of self-reported fluctuations in symptoms, behaviors, and psychosocial problems can help both YP and health care professionals (HCPs) better understand the patient's condition, identify barriers to self-management, and assess treatment effectiveness and additional health care needs. No comprehensive smartphone app has yet been developed in collaboration with YP with JIA, their parents, and HCPs involved in their care.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to design, develop, and evaluate the acceptability and usability of JIApp, a self-management smartphone app system for YP with JIA and HCPs.
METHODS: We used a qualitative, user-centered design approach involving YP, parents, and HCPs from the rheumatology team. The study was conducted in three phases: (1) phase I focused on developing consensus on the features, content, and design of the app; (2) phase II was used for further refining and evaluating the app prototype; and (3) phase III focused on usability testing of the app. The interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 29 YP (aged 10-23, median age 17) with JIA, 7 parents, and 21 HCPs were interviewed. Major themes identified as the ones that helped inform app development in phase I were: (1) remote monitoring of symptoms, well-being, and activities; (2) treatment adherence; and (3) education and support. During phase II, three more themes emerged that informed further refinement of the app prototype. These included (4) adapting a reward system to motivate end users for using the app; (5) design of the app interface; and (6) clinical practice integration. The usability testing during phase III demonstrated high rates of overall satisfaction and further affirmed the content validity of the app.
CONCLUSIONS: We present the development and evaluation of a smartphone app to encourage self-management and engagement with health care for YP with JIA. The app was found to have high levels of acceptability and usability among YP and HCPs and has the potential to improve health care and outcomes for this age group. Future feasibility testing in a prospective study will firmly establish the reliability, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of such an app intervention for patients with arthritis.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.burns.2016.11.006},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Telemedicine in outpatient burn care, particularly in burn scar management, may provide cost-effective care and comes highly rated by patients. However, an effective scar scale using both video and photographic elements has not been validated. The purpose of this study is to test the reliability of the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) using live video-conferencing.
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted with individuals with healed burn scars in Kathmandu, Nepal. Three independent observers assessed 85 burn scars from 17 subjects, using the Observer portion to evaluate vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability, surface area, and overall opinion. The on-site observer was physically present with the subjects and used a live videoconferencing application to show the scars to two remote observers in the United States. Subjects used the Patient portion to evaluate the scar that they believed appeared the worst appearance and had the greatest impact on function.
RESULTS: The single-rater reliability of the Observer scale was acceptable (ICC{\textgreater}0.70) in overall opinion, thickness, pliability, and surface area. The average-rater reliability for three observers was acceptable (ICC{\textgreater}0.70) for all parameters except for vascularity. When comparing Patients' and Observers' overall opinion scores, patients consistently reported worse opinion.
CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of burn scars using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale can be accurately performed via live videoconferencing and presents an opportunity to expand access to burn care to rural communities, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where patients face significant access barriers to appropriate follow-up care.},

The aim of this study was to explore Australian-based tele-orthopaedic services, and to identify the barriers and enablers associated with these services. We used a qualitative case study methodology where specific services were identified from multiple sources and invited to participate in a structured interview. Nine tele-orthopaedic services contributed to the study. Telehealth activity in each service ranged from one to 75 patients per week, and service maturity ranged from three months to 10 years. Services were used predominantly for fracture clinics and peri-operative consultations. The majority (78\%) of services used videoconferencing. Two services used asynchronous methods to review radiographs without direct patient involvement. Tele-orthopaedics was found to be disruptive as it required the redesign of many care processes. However, all services found the redesign feasible. Staff resistance was a commonly cited barrier. Further, imaging repositories from multiple imaging providers complicated access to information. Key enablers included clinical champions, picture archiving and communication systems, and the perceived benefit to patients who would avoid the need for travel. Whilst it appears that tele-orthopaedics is not widely utilised in Australia, recognition of the barriers and enablers is important for the development of similar services.},

The service may be low-cost if the healthcare organisation utilise their existing email infrastructure to provide their telemedicine service. Many healthcare organisations use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) email applications. COTS email applications are designed for peer-to-peer communication; hence, in situations where multiple clinicians need to be involved, COTS applications may be deficient in delivering telemedicine. Larger services often rely on different staff disciplines to run their service and telemedicine tools for supervisors, clinicians and administrative staff are not available in COTS applications. Hence, some organisations may choose to develop a purpose-written email application to support telemedicine. We have conducted a cost-minimisation analysis of two different service models for establishing and operating an email service. The first service model used a COTS email application and the second used a purpose-written telemedicine application.
METHODS: The actual costs used in the analysis were from two organisations that originally ran their counselling service with a COTS email application and later implemented a purpose-written application. The purpose-written application automated a number of the tasks associated with running an email-based service. We calculated a threshold at which the higher initial costs for software development were offset by efficiency gains from automation. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of individual costs on the threshold.
RESULTS: The cost of providing an email service at 1000 consultations per annum was \$19,930 using a COTS email application and \$31,925 using a purpose-written application. At 10,000 consultations per annum the cost of providing the service using COTS email software was \$293,341 compared to \$272,749 for the purpose-written application. The threshold was calculated at a workload of 5216 consultations per annum. When more than 5216 email consultations per annum are undertaken, the purpose-written application was cheaper than the COTS service model. The sensitivity analysis showed the threshold was most sensitive to changes in administrative staff salaries.
CONCLUSION: In the context of telemedicine, we have compared two different service models for email-based communication - purpose-written and COTS applications. Under the circumstances described in the paper, when workload exceeded 5216 email consultations per annum, there were savings made when a purpose-written email application was used. This analysis provides a useful economic model for organisations contemplating the use of an email-based telemedicine system.},

	abstract = {Dynamic treatment strategies are designed to change treatments over time in response to intermediate outcomes. They can be deployed for primary treatment as well as for the introduction of adjuvant treatment or other treatment-enhancing interventions. When treatment interventions are delayed until needed, more cost-efficient strategies will result. Sequential multiple assignment randomized (SMAR) trials allow for unbiased estimation of the marginal effects of different sequences of history-dependent treatment decisions. Because a single SMAR trial enables evaluation of many different dynamic regimes at once, it is naturally thought to require larger sample sizes than the parallel randomized trial. In this paper, we compare power between SMAR trials studying a regime, where treatment boosting enters when triggered by an observed event, versus the parallel design, where a treatment boost is consistently prescribed over the entire study period. In some settings, we found that the dynamic design yields the more efficient trial for the detection of treatment activity. We develop one particular trial to compare a dynamic nursing intervention with telemonitoring for the enhancement of medication adherence in epilepsy patients. To this end, we derive from the SMAR trial data either an average of conditional treatment effects ('conditional estimator') or the population-averaged ('marginal') estimator of the dynamic regimes. Analytical sample size calculations for the parallel design and the conditional estimator are compared with simulated results for the population-averaged estimator. We conclude that in specific settings, well-chosen SMAR designs may require fewer data for the development of more cost-efficient treatment strategies than parallel designs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Decentralised services using outreach clinics or modern technology are methods to reduce both patient transports and costs to the healthcare system. Telemedicine consultations via videoconference are one such modality. Before new technologies are implemented, it is important to investigate both the quality of care given and the economic impact from the use of this new technology. The aim of this clinical trial was to study the quality of planned remote orthopaedic consultations by help of videoconference.
METHOD: We performed a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel groups: video-assisted remote consultations at a regional medical centre (RMC) as an intervention versus standard consultation in the orthopaedic outpatient clinic at the University Hospital of North Norway (UNN) as a control. The participants were patients referred to or scheduled for a consultation at the orthopaedic outpatient clinic. The orthopaedic surgeons evaluated each consultation they performed by completing a questionnaire. The primary outcome measurement was the difference in the sum score calculated from this questionnaire, which was evaluated by the non-inferiority of the intervention group. The study design was based on the intention to treat principle. Ancillary analyses regarding complications, the number of consultations per patient, operations, patients who were referred again and the duration of consultations were performed.
RESULTS: Four-hundred patients were web-based randomised. Of these, 199 (98 \%) underwent remote consultation and 190 (95 \%) underwent standard consultation. The primary outcome, the sum score of the specialist evaluation, was significantly lower (i.e. 'better') at UNN compared to RMC (1.72 versus 1.82, p = 0.0030). The 90 \% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in score (0.05, 0.17) was within the non-inferiority margin. The orthopaedic surgeons involved evaluated 98 \% of the video-assisted consultations as 'good' or 'very good'. In the ancillary analyses, there was no significant difference between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the argument that it is safe to offer video-assisted consultations for selected orthopaedic patients. We did not find any serious events related to the mode of consultation. Further assessments of the economic aspects and patient satisfaction are needed before we can recommend its wider application.

Telemedicine consultation through videoconference is one such modality. Here, we compared patient-reported health outcomes and satisfaction between video-assisted remote and standard face-to-face orthopaedic consultations. Methods This randomised controlled trial included two parallel groups: (1) patients receiving video-assisted remote consultation at a regional medical centre (RMC); and (2) patients receiving standard consultation at the orthopaedic outpatient clinic of the University Hospital of North Norway (UNN). This study included patients referred to or scheduled for a consultation at the orthopaedic outpatient clinic. After each consultation, patient satisfaction was determined using patient-completed questionnaires containing questions on patient-reported health (three-level European quality of life five-dimension index (EQ-5D-3L)/European quality of life visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS)) and questions from a validated OutPatient Experiences Questionnaire (OPEQ). Results This study included 389 patients, of which 199 received remote consultation and 190 received standard consultation (total of 559 consultations). In all, 99\% RMC-randomised patients and 99\% UNN-randomised patients evaluated the consultation as very satisfactory or satisfactory. Moreover, 86\% RMC-randomised patients preferred video-assisted consultation as the next consultation. No difference was observed in patient-reported health after 12 months between the two groups. EQ-5D index scores were 0.77 and 0.75 for RMC- and UNN-randomised patients, respectively ( p = 0.42). Discussion We did not observe any difference in patient-reported satisfaction and health (EQ-5D/EQ-VAS) between video-assisted and standard consultations, suggesting that video-assisted remote consultation can be safely offered to some orthopaedic patients. Moreover, a significantly high proportion of patients selected video-assisted remote consultation as their next consultation, thus strengthening the findings of this study. However, economic aspects should be assessed before widely recommending video-assisted consultation.},

	abstract = {Store-and-forward telepsychiatry, or asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP), which allows clinical data, including video to be collected to be reviewed at a later time by a specialist, has been described as a feasible alternative to real-time telepsychiatry, or synchronous telepsychiatry (STP), as a consultation model for primary care. In theory, ATP should be economically more cost-effective than STP due to the increased flexibility of patient data collection and the substitution of the time of specialists with that of lower-cost providers. The aim of this study was to conduct a retrospective cost-analysis comparing ATP with STP and traditional in-person psychiatric consultations in the primary care setting. One hundred and twenty five ATP consultations were performed and fixed and marginal costs were calculated for each model using inputs such as equipment costs, time spent by providers and support staff, and hourly salaries. The fixed costs were \$7,000 and \$20,000 for ATP and STP and marginal costs were \$68.18, \$107.50, and \$96.36, respectively, for the three groups. STP was the most expensive of the three types of consultations. ATP became the most cost-effective of the three models beyond 249 consultations. The marginal cost savings of ATP were due to substitution of low-cost providers for specialists. ATP represents a potential disruptive healthcare process that could allow more affordable care to be delivered to a larger population of patients. A full accounting of ATP's efficiency will require further studies, including prospective cost-benefit analyses from the perspectives of the patient, provider, and society.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: As better international normalized ratio (INR) control and self-testing reduce events in warfarin-treated patients, and vitamin K supplementation may improve INR control, our primary objective was to evaluate the effect of a system combining frequent INR self-testing with online remote monitoring and management (STORM₂) and low-dose vitamin K supplementation on INR control; our secondary objectives were to assess the impact of STORM₂ on clinician time and to evaluate the influence of pharmacogenomics on INR stability and warfarin dose after vitamin K supplementation.
DESIGN: Prospective pre- and postintervention study.
SETTING: Freestanding clinical research center.
PATIENTS: Fifty-five patients treated with long-term warfarin therapy who were referred from four anticoagulation clinics and seven medical practices.
INTERVENTION: All patients performed weekly INR self-testing and received vitamin K 100 µg/day and online anticoagulation management for 1 year.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: INR control and time required for anticoagulation management were assessed, and an analysis of warfarin dosing and INR stability by genetic polymorphism subgroup (vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 [VKORC1] and cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme) was performed; vitamin K product content was also analyzed. The percentage of time that the INR is within the time in therapeutic range (TTR) improved from 56\% before the intervention to 81\% after the intervention (p{\textless}0.0001), and time spent at extreme INR values of lower than 1.5 or higher than 5 was reduced from 3.1\% to 0.4\% (p=0.01). Clinician time was less than 10 minutes per four patient visits per month. Genetic polymorphisms did not correlate with INR stability or the increase in warfarin dose after vitamin K supplementation. The content of the vitamin K product, however, was only 34-76\% of the labeled amount. Patients with the GG VKORC1 genotype required a higher warfarin dose than predicted by the genomic-based dosing chart in the warfarin package insert.
CONCLUSION: The 25\% point improvement in TTR with STORM₂ is a greater improvement than reported previously with other efforts to improve TTR. STORM₂ required a minimum amount of clinician time. Pharmacogenomics were not predictive of improved INR control or the magnitude of the warfarin dose after vitamin K supplementation, although the content of the product was unreliable. Patients with the GG VKORC1 genotype required a higher warfarin dose than predicted by the product information. The potential clinical impact of improved INR control with this method warrants comparisons with conventionally managed warfarin and with the new oral anticoagulants.},

Clear evidence for the importance of intensity of therapy in optimizing functional outcomes is found in animal models, supported by neuroimaging and behavioral research, and strengthened by recent meta-analyses from multiple clinical trials. However, providing intensive therapy using conventional treatment paradigms is expensive and sometimes not feasible because of social and environmental factors. This article addresses the need for cost-effective increased intensity of practice and suggests potential benefits of telehealth (TH) as an innovative model of care in physical therapy.
SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: We provide an overview of TH and present evidence that a web-supported program, used in conjunction with constraint-induced therapy (CIT), can increase intensity and adherence to a rehabilitation regimen. The design and feasibility testing of this web-based program, "LifeCIT," is presented. We describe how wearable sensors can monitor activity and provide feedback to patients and therapists. The methodology for the development of a wearable device with embedded inertial and mechanomyographic sensors, algorithms to classify functional movement, and a graphical user interface to present meaningful data to patients to support a home exercise program is explained.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: We propose that wearable sensor technologies and TH programs have the potential to provide most-effective, intensive, home-based stroke rehabilitation.},

However, polysomnography requires trained staff and specific equipment in a laboratory setting, which are expensive and limited resources are available. Mobile and wearable devices such as fitness wristbands can perform limited sleep monitoring but are not evaluated well. Here, the development and evaluation of a mobile application to record and synchronize data from consumer-grade sensors suitable for sleep monitoring is presented and evaluated for data collection capability in a clinical trial.
METHODS: Wearable and ambient consumer-grade sensors were selected to mimic the functionalities of clinical sleep laboratories. Then, a modular application was developed for recording, processing and visualizing the sensor data. A validation was performed in three phases: (1) sensor functionalities were evaluated, (2) self-experiments were performed in full-night experiments, and (3) the application was tested for usability in a clinical trial on primary snoring.
RESULTS: The evaluation of the sensors indicated their suitability for assessing basic sleep characteristics. Additionally, the application successfully recorded full-night sleep. The collected data was of sufficient quality to detect and measure body movements, cardiac activity, snoring and brightness. The ongoing clinical trial phase showed the successful deployment of the application by medical professionals.
CONCLUSION: The proposed software demonstrated a strong potential for medical usage. With low costs, it can be proposed for screening, long-term monitoring or in resource-austere environments. However, further validations are needed, in particular the comparison to a clinical sleep laboratory.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, costs, and patients' and caregivers' acceptance of our model of telemedicine in a high-risk chronic heart failure (CHF) older population.
METHODS: Patients with high risk/refractory CHF were included. In the case of alarm parameters' modifications, a cardiologist decided to inform the emergency department (ED), the patient's General Practioner, or to programme a clinical ambulatory control.
RESULTS: Forty-eight CHF patients (28 males; 58.3\%), with a mean age of 80.4 ± 7.7 years, entered this clinical experience. During the 20-months follow-up, four patients dropped out from counselling (8.3\%), ambulatory clinical control within-24 h was planned in 18\% of patients, 11\% of patients were admitted to an ED, and 18\% were hospitalized. Thirteen patients (29.5\%) died a cardiac death; hospital admissions for heart failure decreased during the year after the enrolment when compared to the year before (from 35 to 12 acute HF hospitalizations/year; p = 0.0001). Moreover, in these HF patients followed, accesses to an ED for an acute episode of HF decompensation reduced from 21/year to five/year (p = 0.0001). The economic expenditure, calculated for the year before and after the enrolment, reduced from 116.856 Euros to 40.065 Euros/year.
CONCLUSIONS: A telemedicine surveillance in high-risk older CHF patients determines a continuous and active contact between patients/caregivers, the Heart Failure Clinic, and family physicians, permitting an early evaluation of signs and symptoms of acute decompensation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertension (HTN) is an important problem in the United States, with an estimated 78 million Americans aged 20 years and older suffering from this condition. Health disparities related to HTN are common in the United States, with African Americans suffering from greater prevalence of the condition than whites, as well as greater severity, earlier onset, and more complications. Medication adherence is an important component of HTN management, but adherence is often poor, and simply forgetting to take medications is often cited as a reason. Mobile health (mHealth) strategies have the potential to be a low-cost and effective method for improving medication adherence that also has broad reach.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical effectiveness of BPMED, an intervention designed to improve medication adherence among African Americans with uncontrolled HTN, through fully automated text messaging support.
METHODS: We conducted two parallel, unblinded randomized controlled pilot trials with African-American patients who had uncontrolled HTN, recruited from primary care and emergency department (ED) settings. In each trial, participants were randomized to receive either usual care or the BPMED intervention for one month. Data were collected in-person at baseline and one-month follow-up, assessing the effect on medication adherence, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), medication adherence self-efficacy, and participant satisfaction. Data for both randomized controlled pilot trials were analyzed separately and combined.
RESULTS: A total of 58 primary care and 65 ED participants were recruited with retention rates of 91\% (53/58) and 88\% (57/65), respectively. BPMED participants consistently showed numerically greater, yet nonsignificant, improvements in measures of medication adherence (mean change 0.9, SD 2.0 vs mean change 0.5, SD 1.5, P=.26), SBP (mean change -12.6, SD 24.0 vs mean change -11.3, SD 25.5 mm Hg, P=.78), and DBP (mean change -4.9, SD 13.1 mm Hg vs mean change -3.3, SD 14.3 mm Hg, P=.54). Control and BPMED participants had slight improvements to medication adherence self-efficacy (mean change 0.8, SD 9.8 vs mean change 0.7, SD 7.0) with no significant differences found between groups (P=.92). On linear regression analysis, baseline SBP was the only predictor of SBP change; participants with higher SBP at enrollment exhibited significantly greater improvements at one-month follow-up (β=-0.63, P{\textless}.001). In total, 94\% (51/54) of BPMED participants agreed/strongly agreed that they were satisfied with the program, regardless of pilot setting.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of text message reminders to improve medication adherence is a feasible and acceptable approach among African Americans with uncontrolled HTN. Although differences in actual medication adherence and blood pressure between BPMED and usual care controls were not significant, patterns of improvement in the BPMED condition suggest that text message medication reminders may have an effect and fully powered investigations with longer-term follow-up are warranted.

The use of remote-monitoring (RM) techniques in this group can significantly improve clinical outcomes, but there are limited data about the impact of RM on healthcare costs from a payer's perspective.
AIM: The aim of the study was to assess the impact on costs for the healthcare system of RM in patients with ICD or CRT-D.
METHODS: We examined a cohort of 842 patients with ICD or CRT-D. The group was divided into two groups based on RM (or no RM [NRM]), matched according to important clinical characteristics. The subjects were followed for a maximum of three years after implantation (mean follow-up 2.11 ± 0.83 years). The overall costs for the healthcare provider in the follow-up were defined as the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoint was the use of different types of medical contact events: hospitalisation and number of in-clinic and general practitioner visits (without the number of remote transmissions).
RESULTS: In the three-year follow-up, the reduction in the costs of treatment for National Health Care in the RM group was 33.5\% (median value, p {\textless} 0.001). In patients with implanted CRT-D, the reduction reached 42.7\% (p = 0.011), and with ICD it was 31.3\% (p = 0.007). We observed no significant reduction in the median hospitalisation costs in the three-year follow-up in the RM group (p = NS), despite a 25\% drop in the mean value. The costs of outpatient visits were slightly higher in the RM group (p = NS). In the follow-up period, there was no reduction in the number of medical contact events (p = NS).
CONCLUSIONS: Remote monitoring in patients with implanted ICD or CRT-D devices reduces the cost for the national healthcare provider.},

We assessed, in a feasibility study, whether telematic transmission using the Dream® and Sleepbox® technologies was associated with low HPSG failure rate.
METHODS: Patients referred by chest physicians for clinical suspicion of OSA underwent one HPSG, using Dream® and Sleepbox® (Medatec, Belgium), which is a wireless system able to communicate with Dream®, and with Internet through a wi-fi/3G interface. It is equipped with a digital infrared camera, and with a speaker/microphone system for bidirectional audio/video communication via Skype®. The Sleep Lab nurse performed a remote discontinuous monitoring of the PSG. In case of sensor loss, she called the patient who had been previously educated to replace the sensors.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients have been studied. 90\% of the recordings were of excellent quality. We observed a 10\% PSG failure rate: one failure of the Dream®, and one recording of poor quality. There were 2 successful Skype® interventions resulting in readjustment of the defective probes (nasal cannula and EEG). PSG signal visualization was possible in 90\% of cases but Skype® connection was problematic in 19\% of cases. However, patients could be reached by phone to solve the problem.
CONCLUSIONS: Real-time attended HPSG through telematic data transmission is feasible and could be an interesting perspective to decrease the failure rate of home sleep studies, even if some technical aspects need to be improved.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Heart failure is an increasing burden for all healthcare systems with prevalence reaching over 20 million patients worldwide and direct costs of disease requiring ∼1\% of healthcare budget expenditures. Beyond traditional pharmaceutical treatment, medical devices and remote monitoring tools were introduced to ensure a closely managed control of patients. In this context, a decision-maker needs to know whether the new technology provides clinical benefit towards patients and what resource use is attached to them.
METHODS: Health services research is a complementary approach to clinical trials providing results to the impact of the technology in real life settings. As an example this study reports of a secondary data analysis of one of the largest health insurance companies in Germany, comparing resource use of heart failure patients receiving a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device coupled with a fluid status monitoring and alert function with patients receiving conventional CRT, ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator), or no intervention.
RESULTS: Disease-associated expenses can be attributed to far more than 50\% to heart failure. Although implementation of the CRT device with alert function was most expensive (31,794 Euros compared to 27,659 Euros in the conventional CRT group, 24,128 Euros in the ICD group, and 3735 Euros in the no intervention group) in the first year after implementation, the least costs have been caused in this group (7000 Euros compared to more than 11,000 Euros in all other groups).
CONCLUSION: This article highlights potential health services research approaches focusing on the example of a CRT device coupled with a pulmonary diagnostic and alert function. Although this retrospective analysis holds a number of limitations (e.g., small number of patients in intervention group, cost calculations only from the payer perspective), and despite the need for randomized controlled trials, it was shown that secondary data research in this field is a valuable approach.},

HYPOTHESIS: Pre-hospital telemedicine electrocardiogram triage for regional public emergency medical service may reduce costs.
METHODS: An economic evaluation (cost analysis) was performed from the perspective of regional health-care system. Patients enrolled in the study and considered for cost analysis were those who called the local emergency medical service (EMS; dialing 1-1-8) during 2012 and underwent prehospital field triage with a telemedicine electrocardiogram (ECG) in the case of suspected acute cardiac disease (acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia). The prehospital ECGs were read by a remote cardiologist, available 24/7. Cost savings associated with this method were calculated by subtracting the cost of prehospital triage with telemedicine support from the cost of conventional emergency department triage (ECG and consultation by a cardiologist).
RESULTS: During 2012, the regional EMS performed 109 750 ECGs by telemedicine support. The associated total cost for the regional health-care system was €1 833 333, with a €16.70 cost per single ECG/consultation. Given the cost of similar conventional emergency department treatment from a regional rate list of €24.80 to €55.20, the savings was €8.10 to €38.40 per ECG/consultation (total savings, €891 759.50 to €4 219 379.50). The cost for ruling out an acute cardiac disease was €25.30; for a prehospital diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, €49.20. With 629 prehospital diagnoses of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and reported reductions in mortality thanks to prehospital diagnosis deduced from prior studies, 69 lives per year presumably could be saved, with a cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of €1927, €990/€ - 2508 after correction for potential savings.
CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital EMS triage with telemedicine ECG in patients with suspected acute cardiac disease may reduce health-care costs.},

AIM: This paper aims to highlight such challenges and propose practical solutions.
METHODS: Nine hemophilia specialists from Australia and New Zealand reached consensus on areas of greatest need for improvement in hemophilia care in these countries, based on clinical experience and published data, and agreed on how to address these.
RESULTS: Demography, optimizing treatment and assessing treatment success were identified as broad areas of challenge which included: comorbidities in ageing patients; transitioning from pediatric to adult care; equity of care for remote populations; weight-based dosing in obese patients; tailoring prophylaxis; accurate diagnosis of acute joint pain; managing chronic arthropathy; providing psychosocial support; consistency in definitions and assessment; and quantifiable outcome measures. Practice points included increased cross-specialty coordination and including psychologists and rheumatologists as part of comprehensive care teams; close collaboration between pediatric and adult centers to facilitate transition of care; systems such as telehealth that ensure continuity of care for remote populations; using pharmacokinetic data to tailor therapy; rapid and accurate diagnosis of acute joint pain; using data from bleeding registries to assess treatment effects and help with service planning; and ensuring consistency through benchmarking and standardization of HTCs.
SUMMARY: Achieving treatment equity, optimal outcomes and cost savings may be possible through investing in national governance structures, expanding the comprehensive model of care and implementing innovative solutions tailored to local needs.},

Most of these cases can be cured by quick, inexpensive surgical procedures, but a shortage of trained surgeons makes it unlikely that the need for such surgeries-estimated to reach 32 million cases globally by 2020-can be met under current practices. HelpMeSee Inc. (HMS) is developing an approach to surgery training and delivery that includes use of high-fidelity simulator technology and associated curricula for high-volume training, development of a system of independent private practitioners, and training where necessary of individuals without medical degrees. RAND researchers determined that the program has the potential to scale up surgical capacity rapidly and that under optimistic assumptions, the HMS program could largely close the backlog of surgical cases in the four major regions studied, resulting in 21 million cases of cataract-caused visual impairment in 2030, compared with 134 million cases under the status quo. The program also promises to have large impacts on health and productivity, and the estimated costs per year of disability averted suggest that the intervention would be highly cost-effective in each of the regions researched. However, a number of significant challenges need to be met, particularly in the areas of outreach, remote monitoring of independent practitioners (especially non-doctors), and public and legal acceptance of non-doctors as surgeons. It is important to carefully pilot and monitor the approach before fully scaling up.},

The literature identifies a need for a more rigorous method to validate and quantify evidence-based value for remote monitoring (RM) systems being used to monitor persons with a chronic disease. ROC analysis is an engineering approach widely applied in medical testing, but that has not been evaluated for its utility in RM. Classifiers (saturated peripheral oxygen [SPO2], blood pressure [BP], and pulse), optimum threshold, and predictive accuracy are evaluated based on patient outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Parametric and nonparametric methods were used. Event-based patient outcomes included inpatient hospitalization, accident and emergency, and home health visits. Statistical analysis tools included Microsoft (Redmond, WA) Excel(®) and MedCalc(®) (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium) version 12 © 1993-2013 to generate ROC curves and statistics. Persons with COPD were monitored a minimum of 183 days, with at least one inpatient hospitalization within 12 months prior to monitoring. Retrospective, de-identified patient data from a United Kingdom National Health System COPD program were used. Datasets included biometric readings, alerts, and resource utilization.
RESULTS: SPO2 was identified as a predictive classifier, with an optimal average threshold setting of 85-86\%. BP and pulse were failed classifiers, and areas of design were identified that may improve utility and predictive capacity. Cost avoidance methodology was developed.
CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS can be applied to health services planning decisions. Methods can be applied to system design and evaluation based on patient outcomes. This study validated the use of ROC in RM program evaluation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Socially assistive robots are being developed for patients to help manage chronic health conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Adherence to medication and availability of rehabilitation are suboptimal in this patient group, which increases the risk of hospitalization.
OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a robot delivering telehealth care to increase adherence to medication and home rehabilitation, improve quality of life, and reduce hospital readmission compared with a standard care control group.
METHODS: At discharge from hospital for a COPD admission, 60 patients were randomized to receive a robot at home for 4 months or to a control group. Number of hospitalization days for respiratory admissions over the 4-month study period was the primary outcome. Medication adherence, frequency of rehabilitation exercise, and quality of life were also assessed. Implementation interviews as well as benefit-cost analysis were conducted.
RESULTS: Intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses showed no significant differences in the number of respiratory-related hospitalizations between groups. The intervention group was more adherent to their long-acting inhalers (mean number of prescribed puffs taken per day=48.5\%) than the control group (mean 29.5\%, P=.03, d=0.68) assessed via electronic recording. Self-reported adherence was also higher in the intervention group after controlling for covariates (P=.04). The intervention group increased their rehabilitation exercise frequency compared with the control group (mean difference -4.53, 95\% CI -7.16 to -1.92). There were no significant differences in quality of life. Of the 25 patients who had the robot, 19 had favorable attitudes.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that a homecare robot can improve adherence to medication and increase exercise. Further research is needed with a larger sample size to further investigate effects on hospitalizations after improvements are made to the robots. The robots could be especially useful for patients struggling with adherence.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study, by using the example of a specific type of eHealth intervention (ie, websites for smoking cessation), were to determine (1) distinct groups of log-in trajectories over a 12-month period, (2) their association with smoking cessation, and (3) baseline user characteristics that predict trajectory group membership.
METHODS: We conducted a functional clustering analysis of 365 consecutive days of log-in data from both arms of a large (N=2637) randomized trial of 2 website interventions for smoking cessation (WebQuit and Smokefree), with a primary outcome of 30-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at 12 months. We conducted analyses for each website separately.
RESULTS: A total of 3 distinct trajectory groups emerged for each website. For WebQuit, participants were clustered into 3 groups: 1-week users (682/1240, 55.00\% of the sample), 5-week users (399/1240, 32.18\%), and 52-week users (159/1240, 12.82\%). Compared with the 1-week users, the 5- and 52-week users had 57\% higher odds (odds ratio [OR] 1.57, 95\% CI 1.13-2.17; P=.007) and 124\% higher odds (OR 2.24, 95\% CI 1.45-3.43; P{\textless}.001), respectively, of being abstinent at 12 months. Smokefree users were clustered into 3 groups: 1-week users (645/1309, 49.27\% of the sample), 4-week users (395/1309, 30.18\%), and 5-week users (269/1309, 20.55\%). Compared with the 1-week users, 5-week users (but not 4-week users; P=.99) had 48\% higher odds (OR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.05-2.07; P=.02) of being abstinent at 12 months. In general, the WebQuit intervention had a greater number of weekly log-ins within each of the 3 trajectory groups as compared with those of the Smokefree intervention. Baseline characteristics associated with trajectory group membership varied between websites.
CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of 1-, 4-, and 5-week usage of websites may be common for how people engage in eHealth interventions. The 5-week usage of either website, and 52-week usage only of WebQuit, predicted a higher odds of quitting smoking. Strategies to increase eHealth intervention engagement for 4 more weeks (ie, from 1 week to 5 weeks) could be highly cost effective.

	abstract = {By its very nature, telehealth relies on technology. Throughout history, as new technologies emerged and afforded people the ability to send information across distances, it was not long before this capability was applied to the most basic need of all: maintaining health. While much of the early work in telehealth was driven by technology (e.g., making opportunistic use of the systems and devices that were available at the time), recent trends are beginning to push the demand for and the development of new technologies specific to the individual needs of telehealth applications. The future of telehealth will benefit greatly from this technology innovation, in particular, in areas such as home telehealth and remote monitoring, e-health and patient portal applications, personal health records, interactive Internet technologies, and robotics. Telehealth, while not a panacea for all of the challenges facing modern healthcare systems, has a substantial and ever-expanding potential to revolutionize the ways in which people receive medical care while offering the possibility to contain costs, manage chronic diseases, and prevent secondary complications. By demanding innovative solutions and speaking out in support of the field, the telehealth community can and should be leading the charge for greater attention to human factors in technology development, interoperable medical records, staff training and competencies, standards and guidelines, and support for expanded telehealth coverage at the national, state, and local levels.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Formative evaluation is conducted in the early stages of system implementation to assess how it works in practice and to identify opportunities for improving technical and process performance. A formative evaluation of a teleneurophysiology service was conducted to examine its technical and sociological dimensions.
METHODS: A teleneurophysiology service providing routine EEG investigation was established. Service use, technical performance and satisfaction of clinical neurophysiology personnel were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. These were contrasted with a previously reported analysis of the need for teleneurophysiology, and examination of expectation and satisfaction with clinical neurophysiology services in Ireland. A preliminary cost-benefit analysis was also conducted.
RESULTS: Over the course of 40 clinical sessions during 20 weeks, 142 EEG investigations were recorded and stored on a file server at a satellite centre which was 130 miles away from the host clinical neurophysiology department. Using a virtual private network, the EEGs were accessed by a consultant neurophysiologist at the host centre for interpretation. The model resulted in a 5-fold increase in access to EEG services as well as reducing average waiting times for investigation by a half. Technically the model worked well, although a temporary loss of virtual private network connectivity highlighted the need for clarity in terms of responsibility for troubleshooting and repair of equipment problems. Referral quality, communication between host and satellite centres, quality of EEG recordings, and ease of EEG review and reporting indicated that appropriate organisational processes were adopted by the service. Compared to traditional CN service delivery, the teleneurophysiology model resulted in a comparable unit cost per EEG.
CONCLUSION: Observations suggest that when traditional organisational boundaries are crossed challenges associated with the social dimension of service delivery may be amplified. Teleneurophysiology requires a governance and management that recognises its socio-technical nature.},

Counterintuitively, these same regions are often well served by mobile phone networks, suggesting the possibility of leveraging portable, camera-enabled mobile phones for diagnostic imaging and telemedicine. Toward this end we have built a mobile phone-mounted light microscope and demonstrated its potential for clinical use by imaging P. falciparum-infected and sickle red blood cells in brightfield and M. tuberculosis-infected sputum samples in fluorescence with LED excitation. In all cases resolution exceeded that necessary to detect blood cell and microorganism morphology, and with the tuberculosis samples we took further advantage of the digitized images to demonstrate automated bacillus counting via image analysis software. We expect such a telemedicine system for global healthcare via mobile phone -- offering inexpensive brightfield and fluorescence microscopy integrated with automated image analysis -- to provide an important tool for disease diagnosis and screening, particularly in the developing world and rural areas where laboratory facilities are scarce but mobile phone infrastructure is extensive.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systems for range of motion (ROM) measurement such as OptoTrak, Motion Capture, Motion Analysis, Vicon, and Visual 3D are so expensive that they become impracticable in public health systems and even in private rehabilitation clinics. Telerehabilitation is a branch within telemedicine intended to offer ways to increase motor and/or cognitive stimuli, aimed at faster and more effective recovery of given disabilities, and to measure kinematic data such as the improvement in ROM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the development of the RehabGesture tool, we used the gesture recognition sensor Kinect(®) (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and the concepts of Natural User Interface and Open Natural Interaction.
RESULTS: RehabGesture can measure and record the ROM during rehabilitation sessions while the user interacts with the virtual reality environment. The software allows the measurement of the ROM (in the coronal plane) from 0° extension to 145° flexion of the elbow joint, as well as from 0° adduction to 180° abduction of the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint, leaving the standing position. The proposed tool has application in the fields of training and physical evaluation of professional and amateur athletes in clubs and gyms and may have application in rehabilitation and physiotherapy clinics for patients with compromised motor abilities.
CONCLUSIONS: RehabGesture represents a low-cost solution to measure the movement of the upper limbs, as well as to stimulate the process of teaching and learning in disciplines related to the study of human movement, such as kinesiology.},

	abstract = {Introduction We report on an evaluation of the Just Right approach for planning care for adults with learning disabilities and how it can support culture change. Just Right combines installing a telemonitoring system with training for care managers in person-centred care planning and the interpretation of charts that summarise activity data for their setting. By providing insights into the needs of individuals Just Right allows existing care provision to be reviewed to ensure it is 'just right'. The Just Right approach can also potentially identify over-care and resources that can released. Methods A mixed-methods approach was used, triangulating qualitative and quantitative baseline and follow-up data. Qualitative data were collected before and after implementation from focus groups on barriers, enablers, success outcomes and impacts. A theory of change was developed. Detailed data on individual adults with learning disabilities were collected before and after installation of equipment using a linked online survey completed by their care managers. Results Nine commissioning local authorities were recruited with 33 care providers serving 417 adults with learning disabilities. Issues relating to implementation included staff acceptance, culture, consent, safeguarding, local authority engagement, interpretation of data and residential setting. Changes to care were identified for 20.3\% of individuals, with 66\% of providers not identifying any changes because Just Right confirmed that they were providing the right level of support. Discussion By combining telemonitoring and person-centred care planning, Just Right provides a holistic approach and necessary information for conversations amongst stakeholders about the care needs of adults with learning disabilities. Depending on how it is introduced, and the nature of conversations held, the Just Right approach can potentially change culture, leading to improved outcomes.},

Teleneurology is a part of Telemedicine which uses modern communication technologies to allow neurology to be practiced when the doctor and patient are not present in the same place, and possibly not at the same time. This study focuses on identifying regional spots as potential territorial stations for the telemedicine service through the GIS (Geographical Information System), a computerized systems that allows placement of data of different types and sources into one system to manage and form spatial relationships that allow the display and analysis of relationships of geographic, environmental, and population factors (Scholten \& de Lepper, 1991). We analyzed the optimal location of territorial telemedicine spots in correspondence of general practitioner clinics. It could be intended as a way to involve general practitioners in the management of those patients. The aim of this study is to improve the quality of life of patients and their caregivers providing a continuity of care through this system that reduces the inconvenience of travel and related costs. We estimated, then, the reduction of costs for patients and care-givers joining the telemedicine service in terms of hours out of work.},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.3807},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Screening for diabetic retinopathy is both effective and cost-effective, but rates of screening compliance remain suboptimal. As screening improves, new methods to deal with screening data may help reduce the human resource needs. Crowdsourcing has been used in many contexts to harness distributed human intelligence for the completion of small tasks including image categorization.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to develop and validate a novel method for fundus photograph grading.
METHODS: An interface for fundus photo classification was developed for the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. We posted 19 expert-graded images for grading by Turkers, with 10 repetitions per photo for an initial proof-of-concept (Phase I). Turkers were paid US \$0.10 per image. In Phase II, one prototypical image from each of the four grading categories received 500 unique Turker interpretations. Fifty draws of 1-50 Turkers were then used to estimate the variance in accuracy derived from randomly drawn samples of increasing crowd size to determine the minimum number of Turkers needed to produce valid results. In Phase III, the interface was modified to attempt to improve Turker grading.
RESULTS: Across 230 grading instances in the normal versus abnormal arm of Phase I, 187 images (81.3\%) were correctly classified by Turkers. Average time to grade each image was 25 seconds, including time to review training images. With the addition of grading categories, time to grade each image increased and percentage of images graded correctly decreased. In Phase II, area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) indicated that sensitivity and specificity were maximized after 7 graders for ratings of normal versus abnormal (AUC=0.98) but was significantly reduced (AUC=0.63) when Turkers were asked to specify the level of severity. With improvements to the interface in Phase III, correctly classified images by the mean Turker grade in four-category grading increased to a maximum of 52.6\% (10/19 images) from 26.3\% (5/19 images). Throughout all trials, 100\% sensitivity for normal versus abnormal was maintained.
CONCLUSIONS: With minimal training, the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce can rapidly and correctly categorize fundus photos of diabetic patients as normal or abnormal, though further refinement of the methodology is needed to improve Turker ratings of the degree of retinopathy. Images were interpreted for a total cost of US \$1.10 per eye. Crowdsourcing may offer a novel and inexpensive means to reduce the skilled grader burden and increase screening for diabetic retinopathy.},

	doi = {10.1186/1472-6963-14-328},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the vast state of Queensland, Australia, access to specialist paediatric services are only available in the capital city of Brisbane, and are limited in regional and remote locations. During home-based palliative care, it is not always desirable or practical to move a patient to attend appointments, and so access to care may be even further limited. To address these problems, at the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) in Brisbane, a Home Telehealth Program (HTP) has been successfully established to provide palliative care consultations to families throughout Queensland.
METHODS: A cost minimisation analysis was undertaken to compare the actual costs of the HTP consultations, with the estimated potential costs associated with face-to face-consultations occurring by either i) hospital based consultations in the outpatients department at the RCH, or ii) home visits from the Paediatric Palliative Care Service. The analysis was undertaken from the perspective of the Children's Health Service. The analysis was based on data from 95 home video consultations which occurred over a two year period, and included costs associated with projected: clinician time and travel; costs reimbursed to families for travel through the Patients Travel Subsidy (PTS) scheme; hospital outpatient clinic costs, project co-ordination and equipment and infrastructure costs. The mean costs per consultation were calculated for each approach.
RESULTS: Air travel (n = 24) significantly affected the results. The mean cost of the HTP intervention was \$294 and required no travel. The estimated mean cost per consultation in the hospital outpatient department was \$748. The mean cost of home visits per consultation was \$1214. Video consultation in the home is the most economical method of providing a consultation. The largest costs avoided to the health service are those associated with clinician time required for travel and the PTS scheme.
CONCLUSION: While face-to-face consultations are the gold standard of care, for families located at a distance from the hospital, video consultation in the home presents an effective and cost efficient method to deliver a consultation. Additionally video consultation in the home ensures equity of access to services and minimum disruption to hospital based palliative care teams.},

However, the full potential of telehealth has not been realised with slow and fragmented uptake. This study describes the awareness, experiences and perceptions of telehealth in an Australian rural community.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 47 participants from three rural towns in the Darling Downs region of Queensland. Content analysis was used to abstract themes and core concepts from the interviews.
RESULTS: Three participants were healthcare providers who had all previously used telehealth in their clinical practice. Twenty-seven (57 \%) participants regularly travelled to access specialist healthcare. While 28 (60 \%) participants were aware of telehealth, only six (13 \%) had actually used telehealth services; three as patients and three as healthcare providers. Major themes evident included: acceptance of the need to travel; paternalism and empowerment; and trust and misconceptions.
CONCLUSIONS: For telehealth initiatives to be successful, there needs to be greater public awareness and understanding of the potential benefits of telehealth. Empowering patients as partners in the delivery of healthcare may be an important factor in the growth of telehealth services.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Videoconferencing has been used to expand medical services to low-access populations and could increase access to genetic services at community sites where in-person visits with genetic providers are not available.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of, patient feedback of, and cognitive and affective responses to remote two-way videoconferencing (RVC) telegenetic services at multiple sociodemographically diverse community practices without access to genetic providers.
METHODS: Patients at 3 community sites in 2 US states outside the host center completed RVC pretest (visit 1, V1) and post-test (visit 2, V2) genetic counseling for cancer susceptibility. Surveys evaluated patient experiences, knowledge, satisfaction with telegenetic and cancer genetics services, anxiety, depression, and cancer worry.
RESULTS: A total of 82 out of 100 (82.0\%) approached patients consented to RVC services. A total of 61 out of 82 patients (74\%) completed pretest counseling and 41 out of 61 (67\%) proceeded with testing and post-test counseling. A total of 4 out of 41 (10\%) mutation carriers were identified: BRCA2, MSH2, and PMS2. Patients reported many advantages (eg, lower travel burden and convenience) and few disadvantages to RVC telegenetic services. Most patients reported feeling comfortable with the video camera--post-V1: 52/57 (91\%); post-V2: 39/41 (95\%)--and that their privacy was respected--post-V1: 56/57 (98\%); post-V2: 40/41 (98\%); however, some reported concerns that RVC might increase the risk of a confidentiality breach of their health information--post-V1: 14/57 (25\%); post-V2: 12/41 (29\%). While the majority of patients reported having no trouble seeing or hearing the genetic counselor--post-V1: 47/57 (82\%); post-V2: 39/41 (95\%)--51 out of 98 (52\%) patients reported technical difficulties. Nonetheless, all patients reported being satisfied with genetic services. Compared to baseline, knowledge increased significantly after pretest counseling (+1.11 mean score, P=.005); satisfaction with telegenetic (+1.74 mean score, P=.02) and genetic services (+2.22 mean score, P=.001) increased after post-test counseling. General anxiety and depression decreased after pretest (-0.97 mean anxiety score, P=.003; -0.37 mean depression score, P=.046) and post-test counseling (-1.13 mean anxiety score, P=.003; -0.75 mean depression score, P=.01); state anxiety and cancer-specific worry did not significantly increase.
CONCLUSIONS: Remote videoconferencing telegenetic services are feasible, identify genetic carriers in community practices, and are associated with high patient satisfaction and favorable cognitive and affective outcomes, suggesting an innovative delivery model for further study to improve access to genetic providers and services. Potential barriers to dissemination include technology costs, unclear billing and reimbursement, and state requirements for provider licensure.},

In one university and two general hospitals, 382 patients were randomised to usual care or telemonitoring and followed for 1 year. Hospital-related and home costs were estimated, based on resource use multiplied by the appropriate unit prices. Effectiveness was expressed as QALYs gained. Information was gathered, using 3 monthly costs diaries and questionnaires. The mean age of the patients was 71 years (range 32-93), 59\% were male and 64\% lived with a partner. Health related quality of life improved by 0.07 points for the usual care and 0.1 points for the telemonitoring group, but the difference between groups was not significant. There were no significant differences in annual costs per patient between groups. At a threshold of €50,000 the probability of telemonitoring being cost-effective was 48\%. The cost effectiveness analysis showed a high level of decision uncertainty, probably caused by the divergence between the participating institutions. It is therefore premature to draw an unambiguous conclusion regarding cost-effectiveness for the whole group.},

To help assess foot wounds remotely, we investigated the reliability of a novel optical imaging system employing a three-dimensional camera and disposable optical marker. We first examined inter- and intraoperator measurement variability (correlation coefficient) of five clinicians examining three different wounds. Then, to assess of the system's ability to identify key clinically relevant features, we had two clinicians evaluate 20 different wounds at two centers, recording observations on a standardized form. Three other clinicians recorded their observations using only the corresponding three-dimensional images. Using the in-person assessment as the criterion standard, we assessed concordance of the remote with in-person assessments. Measurement variation of area was 3.3\% for intraoperator and 11.9\% for interoperator; difference in clinician opinion about wound boundary location was significant. Overall agreement for remote vs. in-person assessments was good, but was lowest on the subjective clinical assessments, e.g., value of debridement to improve healing. Limitations of imaging included inability to show certain characteristics, e.g., moistness or exudation. Clinicians gave positive feedback on visual fidelity. This pilot study showed that a clinician viewing only the three-dimensional images could accurately measure and assess a diabetic foot wound remotely.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Remote assessment of neurological disability in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) could improve access to clinical care and efficiency of clinical research.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a telemedicine-based MS disability examination that does not require an in-home examiner.
METHODS: Adults with MS were recruited after a standardized in-person Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) evaluation, and within 1 week underwent a blinded televideo-enabled EDSS examination with a different clinician. EDSS and tele-EDSS scores were compared.
RESULTS: Overall, 41 adults participated (mean (standard deviation (SD)) age: 47.0 years (11.6); median EDSS: 2 (range: 0-7)); 37 required no in-home assistance for the tele-EDSS evaluation (e.g. help positioning camera). Mean difference between EDSS and tele-EDSS was 0.34 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.07-0.61). For 88\% of evaluations, tele-EDSS and EDSS scores were within 1 point (similar to reported in-person inter-rater differences). Unweighted kappa for agreement within 0.5 point was 0.72. Correlation for individual functional systems (FS) ranged from modest (vision: 0.37) to high (bowel/bladder: 0.79). Overall correlation between EDSS and tele-EDSS was 0.89 ( p {\textless} 0.0001); and 0.98 ( p {\textless} 0.0001) at EDSS range: 4-7.
CONCLUSION: In this proof of principle study, disability evaluation in mild to moderate MS is feasible using telemedicine without an aide at the patient's location.},

Methods: Between January 2017 and December 2017, we surveyed patients and MS neurologists after 50 consecutive routinely scheduled televideo visits and a convenience sample of 100 in-clinic visits. Summary statistics were calculated and comparisons performed.
Results: Overall, 98\% televideo participants found the technology easy to use, and only 17\% believed that an in-person examination would have more effectively addressed their needs for the visit. MS neurologists reported achieving their clinical goals in 47/48 (98\%) of televideo visits and an adequate physical examination with 2 exceptions (possible cauda equina syndrome and visual field loss). Three emergency department referrals were avoided due to televideo availability. Telemedicine reduced travel burden, including a mean (±SD) travel distance of 160 (±196) miles and avoiding overnight lodging and air travel. Telemedicine also reduced indirect costs, including time off work (65\% of employed patients) and caregiver burden (30\% avoided caregiver time off from work/obligations). Across 8 domains of provider interpersonal communication skills, telemedicine and in-clinic participants rated only 1 domain to be different (eye contact), and overall, 96\% of in-clinic and 100\% of telemedicine participants agreed/strongly agreed that their clinical goals had been met.
Conclusions: When incorporated as part of the continuum of MS/neuroimmunology care, clinic to in-home telemedicine reduces travel and caregiver burden and enables efficient, convenient, and effective follow-up.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate methods for lowering cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in asymptomatic urban and rural underserved subjects.
BACKGROUND: Medically underserved populations are at increased CVD risk, and systems to lower CVD risk are needed. Nurse management (NM) and telemedicine (T) systems may provide low-cost solutions for this care.
METHODS: We randomized 465 subjects without overt CVD, with Framingham CVD risk {\textgreater}10\% to NM with 4 visits over 1 year, or NM plus T to facilitate weight, blood pressure (BP), and physical activity reporting. The study goal was to reduce CVD risk by 5\%.
RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-eight subjects completed the study. Cardiovascular disease risk fell by ≥ 5\% in 32\% of the NM group and 26\% of the T group (P, nonsignificant). In hyperlipidemic subjects, total cholesterol decreased (NM -21.9 ± 39.4, T -22.7 ± 41.3 mg/dL) significantly. In subjects with grade II hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg, 24\% of subjects), both NM and T groups had a similar BP response (average study BP: NM 147.4 ± 17.5, T 145.3. ± 18.4, P is nonsignificant), and for those with grade I hypertension (37\% of subjects), T had a lower average study BP compared to NM (NM 140.4 ± 16.9, T 134.6 ± 15.0, P = .058). In subjects at high risk (Framingham score ≥ 20\%), risk fell 6.0\% ± 9.9\%; in subjects at intermediate risk (Framingham score ≥ 10, {\textless} 20), risk fell 1.3\% ± 4.5\% (P {\textless} .001 compared to high-risk subjects). Medication adherence was similar in both high- and intermediate-risk subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: In 2 underserved populations, CVD risk was reduced by a nurse intervention; T did not add to the risk improvement. Reductions in BP and blood lipids occurred in both high- and intermediate-risk subjects with greatest reductions noted in the high-risk subjects. Frequent communication using a nurse intervention contributes to improved CVD risk in asymptomatic, underserved subjects with increased CVD risk. Telemedicine did not change the effectiveness of the nurse intervention.},

DESIGN: Economic evaluation from a societal perspective alongside a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial with 12 months of follow-up.
SETTING: Secondary care, nine hospitals in the Netherlands, 2011-2014.
PARTICIPANTS: 433 employed women aged 18-65 years scheduled for a hysterectomy and/or laparoscopic adnexal surgery.
INTERVENTION: The intervention comprised an internet-based care programme aimed at improving convalescence and preventing delayed return to work (RTW) following gynaecological surgery and was sequentially rolled out. Depending on the implementation phase of their hospital, patients were allocated to usual care (n=206) or to the intervention (n=227).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was duration until full sustainable RTW. Secondary outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), health-related quality of life and recovery.
RESULTS: At 12 months, there were no statistically significant differences in total societal costs (€-647; 95\% CI €-2116 to €753) and duration until RTW (-4.1; 95\% CI -10.8 to 2.6) between groups. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for RTW was 56; each day earlier RTW in the intervention group was associated with cost savings of €56 compared with usual care. The probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 0.79 at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of €0 per day earlier RTW, which increased to 0.97 at a WTP of €76 per day earlier RTW. The difference in QALYs gained over 12 months between the groups was clinically irrelevant resulting in a low probability of cost-effectiveness for QALYs.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering that on average the costs of a day of sickness absence are €230, the care programme is considered cost-effective in comparison with usual care for duration until sustainable RTW after gynaecological surgery for benign disease. Future research should indicate whether widespread implementation of this care programme has the potential to reduce societal costs associated with gynaecological surgery.

	abstract = {Psychiatry and society are interrelated and the biopsychosocial model continues to dominate the clinical psychiatric practice. Some doubts have been expressed in recent years about the value and the wide acceptance of the biopsychosocial model. Ghaemi (2009)1 considers it to be anti-humanistic and advocates the use of less eclectic, less generic, and less vague alternatives. The fundamental changes that have been witnessed in our times across the spectrum of biology, psychology and sociology have made necessary that a conceptual clarity should prevail. The remarkable advances in neurosciences, neurobiology and genetics tend to swing the emphasis towards a more biological basis. Psychosis for example is the condition often regarded as being biologically constructed and most independent of the social context. The symptoms, however, of hallucinations and delusions in psychosis have social meaning for the person experiencing them and are primarily defined socially.2 Furthermore, vulnerability is often the result of social trauma, whether in the form of recent stressors that trigger onset, or earlier circumstances that shape cognitive and emotional style. Moreover, the approved treatment and management of long term psychiatric disorders has involved interventions that are either directly social, or psychosocial. Furthermore, doubts have also been raised by the endophenotype project,3 related to the genetics of schizophrenia. Cohen4 suggested that there may be more individual genotypic patterns associated with schizophrenia than people with schizophrenia on the planet. A recent alternative interpretation (network approach) is gaining some support. It suggests that a stressor causes symptoms that activate other symptoms, in a circular, self-reinforcing way.5 This theory moves away from psychiatric disorders being traditionally conceptualised as categorical or dimensional models. While psychiatry has shifted its focus to a more biological approach, social factors still have an important role in crosscultural diagnosis, psychiatric disorders relating to social deprivation, rehabilitation and enabling social inclusion. The degree to which society is willing to accept people with mental health problems has an obvious impact on their quality of life. We live in a period of cataclysmic social changes with disastrous wars, increased poverty and growing income inequality. The consequences on mental health are phenomenal with epidemics of self-harm and suicidality, higher rates of depression, and intensifying diagnosis of mood and conduct disorders in children and young adults. Other adversities include the disproportional number of people with mental health problems in prisons and penal institutions, the massive escalation of dementia sufferers and the shortcomings of the aspirations of community mental health care. In addition, there is an escalating social pathology with significant numbers of refugees and asylum seekers and rising numbers of homeless particularly in urban areas of the developed world. We should not, however, overlook the better rates of treatment for mental health problems, the emphasis on human rights, the empowerment and the service users' participation and the development in global mental health. All these social factors are important to contemporary psychiatry presenting complex challenges and demanding urgent attention and action.6 There is a need to embrace the development of evidence-based mental health services and a pluralistic approach, which balances appropriately the relevance of biological, psychological and social factors associated with mental health problems. The concept Meta-Community mental health builds on the successes of biological, psychological, social and community psychiatry.7 It incorporates neurosciences, sociology, psychology and anthropology and is delivered wherever the evidence shows that it makes a difference, whether in community or hospital, prisons, schools, court-room, place of work, refugee camp or battle-front. New technologies should be included for public information and education together with e-mental health, training of providers, tele-psychiatry and self-help methods delivered via IT. The boundaries of mental health are enlarging very rapidly and indeed new stakeholders and partners should be welcomed. This opens exciting possibilities but also creates some risks and strong evidence base should continue to guide us. Likelihood of finding early diagnostic and individualized treatment for psychosis, autism and dementia are likely to be of high financial cost. The importance of the social challenges of modern psychiatry was recognised by including mental health for the first time in the New Sustainable Development Goals of United Nations that will determine the global development by 2030 aiming at the promotion of life expectancy for all.8 Strengthening the prevention and treatment of mental health problems is a massive task for sustainable development as mental health has a direct impact on the whole range of Sustainable Development Goals.},

	abstract = {Introduction Home-based telebehavioural healthcare improves access to mental health care for patients restricted by travel burden. However, there is limited evidence assessing the economic value of home-based telebehavioural health care compared to in-person care. We sought to compare the economic impact of home-based telebehavioural health care and in-person care for depression among current and former US service members. Methods We performed trial-based cost-minimisation and cost-utility analyses to assess the economic impact of home-based telebehavioural health care versus in-person behavioural care for depression. Our analyses focused on the payer perspective (Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs) at three months. We also performed a scenario analysis where all patients possessed video-conferencing technology that was approved by these agencies. The cost-utility analysis evaluated the impact of different depression categories on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model assumptions. Results In the base case analysis the total direct cost of home-based telebehavioural health care was higher than in-person care (US\$71,974 versus US\$20,322). Assuming that patients possessed government-approved video-conferencing technology, home-based telebehavioural health care was less costly compared to in-person care (US\$19,177 versus US\$20,322). In one-way sensitivity analyses, the proportion of patients possessing personal computers was a major driver of direct costs. In the cost-utility analysis, home-based telebehavioural health care was dominant when patients possessed video-conferencing technology. Results from probabilistic sensitivity analyses did not differ substantially from base case results. Discussion Home-based telebehavioural health care is dependent on the cost of supplying video-conferencing technology to patients but offers the opportunity to increase access to care. Health-care policies centred on implementation of home-based telebehavioural health care should ensure that these technologies are able to be successfully deployed on patients' existing technology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is effective for reducing risky alcohol use across a variety of medical settings. However, most programs have been unsustainable because of cost and time demands. Telehealth may alleviate on-site clinician burden. This exploratory study examines the feasibility of a new Remote Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (R-BIRT) model.
METHODS: Eligible emergency department (ED) patients were enrolled into one of five models. (1) Warm Handoff: clinician-facilitated phone call during ED visit. (2) Patient Direct: patient-initiated call during visit. (3) Electronic Referral: patient contacted by R-BIRT personnel post visit. (4) Patient Choice: choice of models 1-3. (5) Modified Patient Choice: choice of models 1-2, Electronic Referral offered if 1-2 were declined. Once connected, a health coach offered assessment, counseling, and referral to treatment. Follow up assessments were conducted at 1 and 3 months. Primary outcomes measured were acceptance, satisfaction, and completion rates.
RESULTS: Of 125 eligible patients, 50 were enrolled, for an acceptance rate of 40\%. Feedback and satisfaction ratings were generally positive. Completion rates were 58\% overall, with patients enrolled into a model wherein the consultation occurred during the ED visit, as opposed to after the visit, much more likely to complete a consultation, 90\% vs. 10\%, χ(2) (4, N=50)=34.8, p{\textless}0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: The R-BIRT offers a feasible alternative to in-person alcohol SBIRT and should be studied further. The public health impact of having accessible, sustainable, evidence-based SBIRT for substance use across a range of medical settings could be considerable.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine why, despite growing evidence that radiologists and referring physicians prefer structured reporting (SR) to free text (FT) reporting, SR has not been widely adopted in most radiology departments.
METHODS: A focus group was formed consisting of 11 radiology professionals from eight countries. Eight topics were submitted for discussion. The meeting was videotaped, transcribed, and analyzed according to the principles of qualitative healthcare research.
RESULTS: Perceived advantages of SR were facilitation of research, easy comparison, discouragement of ambiguous reports, embedded links to images, highlighting important findings, not having to dictate text nobody will read, and automatic translation of teleradiology reports. Being compelled to report within a rigid frame was judged unacceptable. Personal convictions appeared to have high emotional value. It was felt that other healthcare stakeholders would impose SR without regard to what radiologists thought of it. If the industry were to provide ready-made templates for selected examinations, most radiologists would use them.
CONCLUSION: If radiologists can be convinced of the advantages of SR and the risks associated with failing to participate actively in its implementation, they will take a positive stand. The industry should propose technology allowing SR without compromising accuracy, completeness, workflows, and cost-benefit balance.
MAIN MESSAGES: Structured reporting offers radiologists opportunities to improve their service to other stakeholders. • If radiologists can be convinced of the advantages of structured reporting, they may become early adopters. • The healthcare industry should propose technology allowing structured reporting. • Structured reporting will fail if it compromises accuracy, completeness, workflows or cost-benefit balance.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The longevity of generators is a crucial determinant of the cost-effectiveness of therapy with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRT-D). We evaluated the trend of device-measured residual battery capacity and longevity projections over 5-year follow-up. We also investigated possible factors associated with battery drain.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 4851 patients in the European LATITUDE(®) database who were followed up for a minimum of 3 years were analysed. The factors associated with battery drain (i.e. year-to-year decrease in residual battery capacity), and thus potentially impacting on device longevity, were mainly the pacing parameters in CRT-D devices and the number of shocks delivered and diverted in both ICD and CRT-D (all P {\textless} 0.01 on linear regression analysis). Over the first 5 years, the longevity estimates provided by devices showed low intra-patient variability and increased with time. The estimates exceeded 10 years for CRT-D and 13 and 12 years for single- and dual-chamber ICDs, respectively. In CRT-D patients, the expected patient age on replacement was 80 ± 12 years, and the expected probability of undergoing device replacement was 63 ± 13\% for New York Heart Association (NYHA) II patients and 37 ± 16\% for NYHA III patients. For comparison, the probabilities of replacing a CRT-D lasting 5 years were 78 ± 8 and 59 ± 13\%, respectively (both P {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Battery drain was mainly associated with pacing output in CRT-D devices and with the number of capacitor charges in both ICD and CRT-D devices. The longevity estimates provided by the devices were consistent and conservative. According to these estimates, among CRT-D recipients a low proportion of patients should require device replacement.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: The MORE-CARE trial is an international, prospective, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Within 8 weeks of de novo implant of a CRT-D, patients were randomized to undergo remote checks alternating with in-office follow-ups (Remote arm) or in-office follow-ups alone (Standard arm). The primary endpoint was a composite of death and cardiovascular (CV) and device-related hospitalization. Use of healthcare resources was also evaluated. A total of 865 eligible patients (mean age 66 ± 10 years) were included in the final analysis (437 in the Remote arm and 428 in the Standard arm) and followed for a median of 24 (interquartile range = 15-26) months. No significant difference was found in the primary endpoint between the Remote and Standard arms [hazard ratio 1.02, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-1.30, P = 0.89] or in the individual components of the primary endpoint (P {\textgreater} 0.05). For the composite endpoint of healthcare resource utilization (i.e. 2-year rates of CV hospitalizations, CV emergency department admissions, and CV in-office follow-ups), a significant 38\% reduction was found in the Remote vs. Standard arm (incidence rate ratio 0.62, 95\% CI 0.58-0.66, P {\textless} 0.001) mainly driven by a reduction of in-office visits.
CONCLUSIONS: In heart failure patients implanted with a CRT-D, remote monitoring did not reduce mortality or risk of CV or device-related hospitalization. Use of healthcare resources was significantly reduced as a result of a marked reduction of in-office visits without compromising patient safety.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the most common (and costly) complications of diabetes are diabetic foot ulcers, which often result in lower-extremity amputation. Regular foot care can reduce complications; however, roughly half of Canadians with diabetes do not participate in screening. We sought to evaluate the economic effects of using telemonitoring for diabetic foot ulcer prevention using mathematical modelling.
METHODS: We used Markov modelling to compare current screening standards (standard care) to population-wide and targeted (high-risk) telemonitoring programs in a hypothetical cohort of Canadian patients aged 60 years. We varied the effectiveness (or outcome), defined as the proportion of diabetic foot ulcers prevented, to explore cost-effectiveness using model parameters from published literature and clinical experts.
RESULTS: At 20\%-40\% effectiveness, population-based prevention resulted in 0.00399-0.00790 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per person over 5 years and an incremental cost of \$479-\$402 compared to standard care. At 15\%-40\% effectiveness, high-risk prevention resulted in a cost decrease per person over 5 years (\$1.26-\$25.55), with health benefits of 0.000207-0.00058 QALYs gained.
INTERPRETATION: The use of telemonitoring in the diabetic lower extremity can offer patients better quality of life and can be cost-effective compared to current Canadian screening practices. Future work should focus on developing and validating technologies based on objective outcome measures for remote monitoring of the diabetic foot.},

Research has been carried out into how to best implement it, and the barriers to its adoption. The impact of telehealth on self-management however has been a neglected area. An evaluation of the implementation of a telehealth programme in one area in the South of England found that some patients were using the telehealth equipment provided to enhance their own self management abilities. Whilst the nurses managing the scheme felt that they had an education role they did not involve their patients in setting goals. The patients equally did not feel that were being educated by their nurses. Patients were using the monitoring equipment independently of the nurses and the scheme to support their self-management strategies. Therefore the concept of graduating from telehealth once good self-management is established needs to be rethought. Patients in this study experienced less face to face contact with their nurse, but also reported that they were happy with the changes. This suggests that for some patients the contact with the nurse may well be able to be reduced or withdrawn however removing the monitoring equipment will remove the very tools essential to continued self-management.},

One of the aims of its "3 million lives" program is to achieve more effective self care. A lot of the research into telehealth has focused on cost effectiveness, effective working practices, and barriers to adoption. Patient experience is frequently discussed in terms of the reassurance experienced from the support offered through telehealth systems.
OBJECTIVE: This study reports the qualitative findings of an evaluation of a local telehealth program introduced by the Dorset Clinical Commissioning Group for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or chronic heart failure.
METHODS: Twenty-nine patients participated in telephone interviews, held at the start of their telehealth experience and after they had been using the system for 3 months. Interviewees included people who had graduated from the telehealth system or had asked to come off it. Healthcare professionals, mainly nurses, involved in the management of patients using the system were also interviewed.
RESULTS: The evaluation found that patients were using the telehealth equipment, often beyond the parameters of the formal telehealth scheme, to develop effective self-management techniques.
CONCLUSION: These results have implications for policy makers, as removing the equipment when patients graduate as being self managing may mean removing the very tools that make that self management possible.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Since 2010, more than 75 rural hospitals have closed in the USA and more than one-third are at risk of closure due to lower patient volumes, lower funding levels, decreased hospital revenue and lower physician employment pools. Telemedicine can provide new models of care delivery that maintain quality and reduce cost of healthcare in rural populations. The purpose of this project was to evaluate a cross-organizational pilot program by comparing a NP/telemedicine physician hospitalist programme with a traditional physician hospitalist model to assess effects on length of patient stay, mortality rates, readmission rate, Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) ratings of provider communication, and total hospital costs.
METHODS: The Standard for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE) guidelines were followed. Using a one-year retrospective chart review, average length of stay, mortality rates, 30-day readmission rates and provider communication ratings were compared between hospitalists that were nurse practitioners working with physicians through telemedicine support and physicians alone.
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant variance in average length of stay, mortality rates, 30-day readmission rates, or provider communication ratings on HCAHPS surveys compared to the NP or physician hospitalist.
DISCUSSION: This new model of care demonstrates that telemedicine can be used to provide safe and efficient physician support from a regional hub medical centre to nurse practitioners practising as hospitalists in rural Critical Access Hospitals at up to 58\% cost savings while maintaining quality of care and increasing access to community-based physicians.},

	abstract = {While cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are prevalent across economic strata, the economically disadvantaged population is disproportionately affected due to the high cost of traditional CVD management, involving consultations, testing and monitoring at medical facilities. Accordingly, developing an ultra-low-cost alternative, affordable even to groups at the bottom of the economic pyramid, has emerged as a societal imperative. Against this backdrop, we propose an inexpensive yet accurate home-based electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring service. Specifically, we seek to provide point-of-care monitoring of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), high frequency of which could indicate the onset of potentially fatal arrhythmia. Note that the first-generation telecardiology system acquires the ECG, transmits it to a professional diagnostic center without processing, and nearly achieves the diagnostic accuracy of a bedside setup. In the process, such a system incurs high bandwidth cost and requires the physicians to process the entire record for diagnosis. To reduce cost, current telecardiology systems compress data before transmitting. However, the burden on physicians remains undiminished. In this context, we develop a dictionary-based algorithm that reduces not only the overall bandwidth requirement, but also the physicians workload by localizing anomalous beats. Specifically, we detect anomalous beats with high sensitivity and only those beats are then transmitted. In fact, we further compress those beats using class-specific dictionaries subject to suitable reconstruction/diagnostic fidelity. Finally, using Monte Carlo cross validation on MIT/BIH arrhythmia database, we evaluate the performance of the proposed system. In particular, with a sensitivity target of at most one undetected PVC in one hundred beats, and a percentage root mean squared difference less than 9\% (a clinically acceptable level of fidelity), we achieved about 99.15\% reduction in bandwidth cost, equivalent to 118-fold savings over first-generation telecardiology. In the process, the professional workload is reduced by at least 85.9\% for noncritical cases. Our algorithm also outperforms known algorithms under certain measures in the telecardiological context.},

Methods This pilot study was a randomised controlled trial combined with an economic analysis to examine the outcomes of standard care versus home-based telehealth for people with diabetes and/or COPD who were at risk of hospital readmission within one year. The primary outcomes were (i) hospital admission and length of stay (LOS); and (ii) health-related quality of life (HRQOL); and the secondary outcomes were (i) health-related clinical outcomes; (ii) anxiety and depression scores; and (iii) health literacy. The costs of the intervention and hospitalisations were included. Results A total of 86 and 85 participants were randomised to the intervention and control groups respectively. The difference between groups in hospital LOS was -3.89 (95\% confidence interval (CI): -9.40, 1.62) days, and for HRQOL, 0.09 (95\% CI: 0.05, 0.14) in favour of the telehealth monitoring group. There was a saving of AUD\$6553 (95\% CI: -12145, -961) in the cost of hospitalisation over 12 months, which offset the increased cost of tele-monitoring. The intervention group showed an improvement in anxiety, depression and health literacy at 12 months, and in the diabetes group, a reduction in microalbuminuria.

Teledermatology is a growing healthcare delivery modality that allows access to subspecialty care at a distance. This article describes how a low-cost teledermatology program was launched through collaboration between the Medical College of Wisconsin and Hillside Healthcare International. Several factors are required for a teledermatology program to be successful, beginning with a partnership between two entities that targets a locally identified need and is mutually beneficial to invested partners. The program should utilize the expertise of each partner, be based on an agreed upon process with clearly defined objectives, and protect patient privacy. After a program is implemented, adaptation to address challenges and best meet the needs of all parties involved will allow for continued success and sustainability. This process can serve as a model for other programs desiring to establish similar teledermatology partnerships in an academic setting.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In Uganda, an estimated 120 obstetrician/gynecologists serve a population of 30 million people demonstrating the need to train additional skilled clinician leaders in reproductive health. In 2012, a partnership was formed with the Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) in southwest Uganda and the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, USA, in part to increase access to specialist training. This report presents an update in the development of a teaching conference between the institutions.
METHODS: In June 2012, a didactic teleconference between the institutions was instituted. Various conferencing tools were tried: direct telephone connection, Ventrilo™ conferencing system and Skype™ via personal computer or smart phone. In Mbarara, Internet was accessed via cellular data. In Boston, Internet was accessed via hospital network or cellular data. All lectures were HIPAA compliant. PowerPoint lectures were stored in a collective Dropbox™ that could be accessed and downloaded prior to lecture dates.
RESULTS: Over 30 months, 30 lectures were given. Lecturers included faculty and fellows from maternal fetal medicine, gynecology oncology, urogynecology, family planning, psychiatry and obstetric anesthesia. A patient case pertinent to the teaching topic framed the discussion. About 20 participants attended each lecture. Internet connectivity was the biggest challenge. Ultimately audio Skype via cellular data proved the most successful modality and became the method of choice.
CONCLUSION: A successful collaboration in medical education via teleconference is sustainable, low cost, and beneficial to both resource-rich and resource-poor institutions. Expertise can be shared bilaterally and internationally by individuals potentially unable travel.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemonitoring has been advocated as a way of decreasing costs and improving outcomes, but no study has looked at true Medicare payments and 30-day readmission rates in a randomized group of well treated patients.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to analyze Medicare claims data to identify effects of home telemonitoring on medical costs, 30-day rehospitalization, mortality, and health-related quality of life.
METHODS: A total of 204 subjects were randomized to usual-care and monitored groups and evaluated with the SF-36 and Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHF). Hospitalizations, Medicare payments, and mortality were also assessed. Monitored subjects transmitted weight, blood pressure, and heart rate, which were monitored by an experienced heart failure nurse practitioner.
RESULTS: Subjects were followed for 802 ± 430 days; 75 subjects in the usual-care group (316 hospitalizations) and 81 in the monitored group (327 hospitalizations) were hospitalized at least once (P = .51). There were no differences in Medicare payments for inpatient or emergency department visits, and length of stay was not different between groups. There was no difference in 30-day readmissions (P = .627) or mortality (P = .575). Scores for SF-36 and MLHF improved (P {\textless} .001) over time, but there were no differences between groups. The percentage of patients readmitted within 30 days was lower with telemonitoring for the 1st year, but this did not persist.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring did not result in lower total costs, decreased hospitalizations, improved symptoms, or improved mortality. A decrease in 30-day readmission rates for the 1st year did not result in decreased total cost or better outcomes.},

	doi = {10.3390/s18072198},
	abstract = {Radon is a noble gas originating from the radioactive decay chain of uranium or thorium. Most radon emanates naturally from the soil and from some building materials, so it can be found in many places around the world, in particular in regions with soils containing granite or slate. It is almost impossible for a person to detect radon gas without proper tools, since it is invisible, odorless, tasteless and colorless. The problem is that a correlation has been established between the presence of high radon gas concentrations and the incidence of lung cancer. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the exposure to radon is the second most common cause of lung cancer after smoking, and it is the primary cause of lung cancer among people who have never smoked. Although there are commercial radon detectors, most of them are either expensive or provide very limited monitoring capabilities. To tackle such an issue, this article presents a cost-effective IoT radon gas remote monitoring system able to obtain accurate concentration measurements. It can also trigger events to prevent dangerous situations and to warn users about them. Moreover, the proposed solution can activate mitigation devices (e.g., forced ventilation) to decrease radon gas concentration. In order to show its performance, the system was evaluated in three different scenarios corresponding to representative buildings in Galicia (Spain), a region where high radon gas concentrations are common due to the composition of the soil. In addition, the influence of using external hardware (i.e., WiFi transceivers and an embedded System-on-Chip (SoC)) next to the radon gas sensor is studied, concluding that, in the tested scenarios, they do not interfere with the measurements.},

In Phase 2, phonetic stimulus-response matrices derived from the SPT results for 408 people were used to calculate "Infograms™." At every frequency, there was a highly significant correlation (p {\textless} 0.001) between hearing thresholds derived from the Infogram and conventional audiograms. In Phase 3, initial hearing aid fittings were derived from conventional audiograms and Infograms for two groups of hearing impaired people. Unaided and aided SPTs were used to measure the perceptual benefit of the aids for the two groups. The mean increases between unaided and aided SPT scores were 19.6\%, and 22.2\% (n = 517, 484; t = 2.2; p {\textless} 0.05) for hearing aids fitted using conventional audiograms and Infograms respectively. The research provided evidence that the SPT is a highly effective tool for the detection and measurement of hearing loss and hearing aid fitting.

Tele-intervention (TI), the delivery of early intervention services via telehealth technology, has the potential to meet this need in a cost-effective manner.
METHOD: Twenty-seven families of infants and toddlers with varying degrees of hearing loss participated in a randomized study, receiving their services primarily through TI or via traditional in-person home visits. Pre- and post-test measures of child outcomes, family and provider satisfaction, and costs were collected.
RESULTS: The TI group scored statistically significantly higher on the expressive language measure than the in-person group (p =.03). A measure of home visit quality revealed that the TI group scored statistically significantly better on the Parent Engagement subscale of the Home Visit Rating Scales-Adapted \& Extended (HOVRS-A+; Roggman et al., 2012). Cost savings associated with providing services via TI increased as the intensity of service delivery increased. Although most providers and families were positive about TI, there was great variability in their perceptions.

	abstract = {AIM: The incidence of oral cancer is high in India, which can be reduced by early detection. We aimed to empower frontline health care providers (FHP) for early detection and connect specialist to rural population through mHealth.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We provided training to FHPs in examination of oral cavity, use of mobile phone for image capture, and risk factor analysis. The FHPs were selected from different cohorts in resource-constrained settings. The workflow involved screening of high-risk individuals in door-to-door and workplace settings, and capture of images of suspected lesions. Uploaded data were interpreted and recommendation was sent by specialist from a remote location. Their recommendation was intimated to FHPs who arranged for further action. Two more initiatives, one for multiple dental schools and another for private practitioners, were undertaken.
RESULTS: During the period from 2010 to 2018, 42,754 subjects have been screened, and 5,406 subjects with potentially malignant disorders have been identified. The prevalence of potentially malignant disorders varied from 0.8 to 62\% at different cohorts; 516 biopsies have been performed at remote locations.
CONCLUSION: Connecting specialists to rural population was made possible through the use of mobile health. Trained FHP were able to reach out to the population. Electronic data capture facilitated efficient follow-up. The program was very cost-effective with screening completed under \$1 per person.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In view of the high incidence of oral cancer in India, and the resource-constrained settings, mobile health paves the way for better access to specialist care for the rural population.},

	abstract = {Over the last ten years the Internet has emerged as a key infrastructure for service innovation, enabling IP (Internet Protocol) to become the wide area network communication protocol of choice. The natural result of this choice is that service providers and their customers are looking for ways to optimise costs by migrating existing services and applications onto IP as well. A good example is the medical industry, which is transitioning to Internet-based communications as the field of telemedicine broadens to preventative and self healthcare. However, technology is changing quickly and consumers face an array of choices to satisfy their healthcare needs with numerous devices from different vendors. Seamless healthcare device networking can play a major role in automating and safeguarding the process of collecting and transferring medical data, remote patient monitoring and reducing costs through remote equipment monitoring. In this scope, we describe an approach augmenting the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) with healthcare services in order to form a framework for efficient collection and storage of measurements, aiming to address the issues of the lack of a standardised data interface for consumer healthcare technologies (including hardware and protocols) and the lack of a standardised format for self-collected healthcare data (including the storage medium). In this framework, measurements can be seamlessly collected and stored as XML notes located virtually anywhere, such as the user's home or mobile device. Additionally, these notes can be accessed locally or remotely by doctors and specialists. Also, we discuss how this approach supports user mobility by proxying and redirecting requests to the user's current location and how it can remove the complexity of using consumer healthcare technologies from different vendors connected to different devices and the opportunities for Independent Software Vendors to develop additional services.},

The service allows primary care providers to receive advice from specialists via a secure electronic platform without necessarily requiring a face-to-face consultation.
INTRODUCTION: As of 2015, over half of the LHIN's family physicians were registered and trained to use the service. However, 24\% of registrants never went on to submit a case. The purpose of this study is to examine the demographic characteristics associated with usage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Usage data for the pool of physicians registered between January 1, 2011 and September 30, 2015 were linked to physician characteristics retrieved from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario database. Probit regressions were estimated to determine characteristics associated with usage.
RESULTS: Neither sex, being an international medical school graduate-documented predictors of electronic medical records adoption-nor proximity to specialists were found to explain usage. Only length of time in practice was found to be predictive. Being out of medical school an additional 10 years was estimated to decrease the probability of ever using eConsult by five percentage points (p {\textless} 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Lower use by veteran physicians may reflect their lower need for services like eConsult given their well-established specialist networks, or their greater confidence in practicing medicine. Future work should explore the reasons and barriers for not registering, or not using eConsult, with an aim toward increasing the appropriate use of this cost-effective and innovative service.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We evaluated the impact of an algorithm for automatic right ventricular (RV) stimulation compared to fixed-output pacing (FOP) stimulation on actual pacemaker longevity over a 9-year follow-up.
METHODS: Prospective observation of 300 patients implanted with VDDR/DDDR pacemakers in 1999-2000 up to October 31, 2008. Sixty-one patients were paced by Autocapture pacing (ACP), 239 were paced by FOP; they were seen twice yearly at the pacemaker clinic. Factors known to affect pacemaker longevity were collected: median heart rate, \%A\&V paced activity, pacing output, and impedance. Patients dead before pacemaker replacement, lost to follow-up, or who developed permanent atrial fibrillation were excluded from analysis.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six of three hundred patients completed the study. Adverse clinical events due to an increased RV threshold occurred in two FOP patients compared to none among ACP. Pacemaker replacement occurred in 1/34 ACP patients versus 60/92 FOP patients (P {\textless} 0.001). ACP was the single independent predictor of pacemaker longevity at multivariable analysis (hazard ratio = 0.03, P {\textless} 0.001) either in the overall population or in the specific patients subgroups (sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular block, and neurally mediated syncope).
CONCLUSIONS: Automatic verification of stimulation is reliable at long term, and warrants superior safety in the event of pacing threshold changes. It allows a significant longevity increase compared to FOP stimulation that may heavily impact the patients' quality of life and the cost of pacing therapy. Moreover, it is a fundamental technology in a strategy of remote patient and device monitoring, and may enable automatic device follow-up operated by trained, nonmedical personnel.},

In addition to this, the illumination beam is also partially transmitted through the same specimen, which then casts lensfree in-line holograms of the same objects onto a second opto-electronic sensor-array that is positioned underneath the beam-splitter cube. By rapid digital reconstruction of the acquired lensfree holograms, transmission images (both phase and amplitude) of the same specimen are also created.

RESULTS: Of 347 eligible post-crisis ED referred patients, 291 (83.9\%) engaged with the IAPT team. Most patients (65\%) had attended the ED previously on an average of 3.9 (SD = 6.0) occasions. Two hundred and forty one patients received an average of 4.1 (SD = 2.3) contacts of low-intensity psychological therapies including 1.2 (SD = 1.7) community outreach visits between 20th Oct 2011 and 31st Dec 2012. Treated patients reported clinically significant improvements in anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. Uncontrolled effect sizes were moderate for anxiety (0.6) and depression (0.6).
DISCUSSION: The Australian ED IAPT program demonstrated that the UK IAPT program could be adapted for emergency mental health patients and be associated with similar clinical benefits as the original program.
FUNDING: The Flinders Medical Centre IAPT program received Emergency Department project funding from the Australian Commonwealth Government through the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) and the South Australian Government initiative, Every Patient Every Service (EPES).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Traumatic spine injuries are often transferred to regional tertiary trauma centers from outside hospitals (OSHs) and subsequently discharged from the trauma center's emergency department (ED) suggesting secondary overtriage of such injuries.
PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to investigate the definitive treatment and disposition of traumatic spine injuries transferred from OSH, particularly those without other trauma injuries or neurologic symptoms.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Adult patients presenting to a single Level 1 trauma center with spine injuries were included.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures considered in the study were appropriateness of transfer, treatment, and cost.
METHODS: Four thousand five-hundred consecutive adult patients presenting to a single Level 1 trauma center with spine injuries (isolated or polytrauma) were reviewed. This consisted of 1,427 patients (32\%) transferred from an OSH ED. All OSH, emergency medical services, and receiving institution (RI) patient records and imaging were reviewed.
RESULTS: Patients who were neurologically intact, nonpolytrauma, and without critical medical issues at the OSH (isolated intact spine transfers) comprised 29\% of transfers. Helicopters transported 13\% of these patients. The most frequent injuries were compression (26\%), burst (17\%), and transverse process (10\%) fractures. Seventy-eight percent were discharged directly from the RI's ED. Similarly, 15\% were not given any formal treatment, 13\% had surgery, and 72\% given orthosis treatment. The average cost for transportation and ED costs for those discharged from the RI ED were \$1,863 and \$12,895, respectively. Of the isolated intact spine transfers, 42\% were considered to be inappropriate to warrant transfer. This was defined as those sent from an OSH with an orthopedic or neurosurgeon on staff and clearly stable injuries with minimal chance of progressing to instability. Isolated intact spine transfers whose OSH spine imaging was not considered unstable was 25\% of transfers with a helicopter used to transport 14\% of these patients. Eighty-seven percent were discharged from the ED, whereas only 3\% went onto surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to investigate interfacility transfers with spine injuries and found high rate of secondary overtriage of neurologically intact patients with isolated spine injuries. Potential solutions include increasing spine coverage in community EDs, increasing direct communication between the OSH and the spine specialist at the tertiary center, and utilization of teleradiology.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Advances in technology have revolutionized the medical field and changed the way healthcare is delivered. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the next wave of technological advancements that have the potential to make a huge splash in clinical medicine. UAVs, originally developed for military use, are making their way into the public and private sector. Because they can be flown autonomously and can reach almost any geographical location, the significance of UAVs are becoming increasingly apparent in the medical field.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review of the English language literature via the PubMed and Google Scholar databases using search terms "unmanned aerial vehicles," "UAVs," and "drone." Preference was given to clinical trials and review articles that addressed the keywords and clinical medicine.
RESULTS: Potential applications of UAVs in medicine are broad. Based on articles identified, we grouped UAV application in medicine into three categories: (1) Prehospital Emergency Care; (2) Expediting Laboratory Diagnostic Testing; and (3) Surveillance. Currently, UAVs have been shown to deliver vaccines, automated external defibrillators, and hematological products. In addition, they are also being studied in the identification of mosquito habitats as well as drowning victims at beaches as a public health surveillance modality.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary studies shine light on the possibility that UAVs may help to increase access to healthcare for patients who may be otherwise restricted from proper care due to cost, distance, or infrastructure. As with any emerging technology and due to the highly regulated healthcare environment, the safety and effectiveness of this technology need to be thoroughly discussed. Despite the many questions that need to be answered, the application of drones in medicine appears to be promising and can both increase the quality and accessibility of healthcare.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemedical wound care is one of the possible applications of teledermatology. The treatment of pediatric wounds needs frequent and periodic assessments of their local status and adjustment of dressings choice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present our experience using telemedicine in the successful assessment and treatment of 19 pediatric patients at the OPBG, Rome . Photographs with a digital camera were taken and sent weekly by mail to a wound care specialist in Rome. This allowed the expert to diagnose and evaluate the wounds periodically.
RESULTS: In the shown cases, telemedicine allowed us to have an immediate evaluation and therapy adjustment. The quality of the images was good enough that the physician could regularly evaluate the status of the wound and immediately give his feedback to the parents. Of these 19, 13 patients (68\%) experienced a wound resolution during the remote monitoring period. The satisfaction of the parents detected at 3, 6 and 12 months was found to be respectively 57\%, 71\%, 84\%.
CONCLUSION: Reducing transportation to the hospital to obtain a specialist advice, wound teleconsultation lowers health care costs and improve the quality of life for pediatric patients and their family, while still maintaining a high quality of pediatric wound care.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The growing incidence of diabetes and the need to contain healthcare costs empower the necessity to identify new models of care. Telemedicine offers an acknowledged instrument to provide clinical health care at a distance, increasing patient compliance and the achievement of therapeutical goals. The objective was to test the feasibility and the efficacy in the improvement of the glycemic control of the teleconsultation for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: A randomized open-label, parallel arms, controlled trial was conducted in two diabetes centers in Italy. Participants affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus have been randomly (1:1) assigned to receive their visits as standard or a web-based care. Patients in the teleconsultation group can arrange their appointments on a Web site and can also have access to web educational courses or to nutritional and psychological counseling. The primary outcome was the assessment of glycemic control by HbA1c measurement after a 12-month follow-up.
RESULTS: Overall 74 participants were followed for 1 year. HbA1c changes were not statistically different within (p = 0.56 for standard care group; p = 0.45 for telemedicine group) and between (p = 0.60) groups when considering differences from baseline to the end of the study. Patients randomized to teleconsultation reported reduced severe hypoglycemic episodes (p = 0.03). In addition, they were largely satisfied with the activities, perceived a good improvement in the self-management of the diabetes, and reported to have a time saving and a cost reduction.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent years have seen an influx of location-tracking, activity-monitoring sensors, and Web-cameras to remotely monitor the safety of older adults in their homes and to reduce reliance on in-person assistance. The state of research on these monitoring technologies leaves open crucial financial, social, and ethical cost-benefit questions, which have prevented widespread use. Medicaid is now the first large third-party payer in the United States to pay for these technologies, and their use is likely to increase as states transition to managed long-term services and supports (MLTSS).
OBJECTIVES: This is the first study to examine how state Medicaid programs are treating passive remote monitoring technologies. This study identifies (1) which states allow location tracking, sensor systems, and cameras; (2) what policies are in place to track their use; (3) what implementation processes and program monitoring mechanisms are in place; and (4) what related insights Medicaid program stakeholders would like to learn from researchers.
METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 43 state, federal, and managed care organization (MCO) Medicaid program stakeholders about how these technologies are used in state waivers serving community-dwelling older adults in 15 states, and what policies are in place to regulate them. The interviews were analyzed by the research team using the framework analysis method for applied policy research.
RESULTS: Two-thirds of the states cover location tracking and activity-monitoring sensors and one-third cover cameras, but only 3 states have specific service categories that allow them to track when they are paying for any of these technologies, impeding regulation and understanding of their use at the state and federal level. Consideration of ethical and social risks is limited, and states struggle to understand which circumstances warrant use. They are further challenged by extreme resource restrictions and transitions to MLTSS by MCOs inexperienced in serving this growing "high-need, high-cost" population.
CONCLUSIONS: Decisions about Medicaid reimbursement of technologies that have the potential to dramatically alter the way older adults receive supportive services are being made without research on their use, social and ethical implications, or outcomes. At a minimum, new service categories are needed to enable oversight. Participants prioritized 3 research aims to inform practice: (1) determine cost-effectiveness; (2) identify what type of information beneficiaries want to be generated and whom they want it to be shared with; and (3) understand how to support ethical decision making for beneficiaries with cognitive impairment. These findings provide direction for future research and reveal that greater interaction between policy makers and researchers in this field is needed.},

In-person cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for insomnia but is hindered by cost and limited access to treatment. Initial research suggests that Web-based CBT may mitigate these obstacles.
INTRODUCTION: This study tests the effectiveness of a Web-based program for insomnia based on principles of CBT and stress management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial with wait-list controls among adults with primary insomnia (n = 88). Two hundred sixty-three adults with comorbid insomnia were also included and analyzed separately. The intervention was a 6-week online program, and effectiveness was measured via the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).
RESULTS: Baseline ISI score for the intervention group (n = 43) was 17.0; 16.6 for the control group (n = 45). At first follow-up, the intervention group (n = 25) had a mean change from baseline of -7.3 (95\% CI: -9.0, -5.6), sustained through second follow-up, while the control group (n = 35) had a change of -1.3 (-2.7, 0.1). The between-group difference was statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.001). Participants in the comorbid insomnia group had a baseline ISI score of 16.7 with improvement similar to the primary insomnia group (-6.9; -7.6, -6.2).
DISCUSSION: We observed clinically meaningful improvements in insomnia severity in adults with primary or comorbid insomnia. Sustained improvement over 4 months underscores the effectiveness of a well-constructed online CBT for insomnia program.

METHODS: TELEMACO provides home-based telemanagement services for patients with chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as second-opinion teleconsultations in cardiology, dermatology, diabetology, and pulmonology for general practitioners and second-opinion teleconsultations on digital images in cases of traumatic brain injury and stroke. A total of 2 service centers, 10 cardiology and pneumology departments, 30 specialists, 176 general practitioners, 40 nurses, 2 emergency departments, and 2 consultant hospitals were involved.
RESULTS: A total of 166 patients with chronic heart failure and 474 patients with COPD were enrolled. There were 4830, 51, and 44 second-opinion teleconsultations for cardiologic, dermatologic, and diabetic conditions, respectively. There were 147 second-opinion teleconsultations on digital images, 68 for stroke, and 79 for traumatic brain injury. Implementation of TELEMACO introduced innovations in working methods and provided evidence to the health authorities for allocating funds for such services.
CONCLUSIONS: TELEMACO provided evidence that there is a growing need for home management of patients using telemedicine, a common and efficacious approach that can ensure care continuity, especially in chronic diseases.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Most dialysis patients have multiple comorbidities with complex healthcare needs and consume a disproportionate share of medical resources. We conducted a pilot study employing telehealth technology to determine whether home-based preventative care can improve healthcare outcomes, impact quality of life (QOL), and be cost effective by proactively managing underlying chronic conditions that place the patient at risk.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients (19 in the remote technology group [RT] and 25 in the usual care group [UC]) participated in this study. The mean age was 57 for those in the RT group (7 females and 12 males) and 62 for those receiving UC (11 females and 14 males). Health outcome measurements included hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and the number of days hospitalized. Economic analysis included total hospital and emergency room charges. QOL was measured using the medical outcomes survey instrument 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).
RESULTS: Hospitalizations (RT 0.0018 and UC 0.0056 per study day), hospital days (RT 0.008 and UC 0.036 per study day), emergency room visits (RT 0.0003 and UC 0.0019 per study day), and associated charges (RT \$114 and UC \$322 per study day) were significantly less in the RT group of the study compared with patients receiving UC. The perceived QOL remained the same in the UC group from outset to midpoint of the study (59.1, 59.5), whereas it decreased slightly in the RT group (63.9, 60.76).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that remote telehealth technology can play an important role in improving health outcomes and the cost of care of patients with end-stage renal disease who have complex healthcare needs.},

Systematic reviews also show that most studies evaluate benefits in terms of the cost savings, with no assessment of the health benefits for patients. In a recent review of economic evaluations, I found 33 articles that measured both costs and non-resource consequences of using telemedicine in direct patient care. This represents a considerable increase compared to previous reviews. The articles analysed were highly diverse in both study context and applied methods. Most studies used multiple outcome measures, such as diagnostic accuracy, blood glucose levels, wound size or quality-adjusted life-years gained. The effectiveness measures appeared more consistent and well reported than the costings. Objectives, study design and choice of comparators were mostly well reported. However, most studies lacked information on perspective and costing method, few used general statistics and sensitivity analysis to assess validity, and even fewer used marginal analysis. These shortcomings in economic evaluation methodology are relatively common and have been found in other fields of research.},

There are two possible ways of increasing generalizability: the first is to use a pragmatic trial design so it better reflects normal patient caseload and everyday practice. The second is to use existing data from the literature and decision modelling to estimate the expected costs and outcomes of different alternatives. The first will increase generalizability to other patients than those in the trial and the second will increase generalizability from place to place. The objective and role of the evaluation will decide the most appropriate evaluation approach. Pragmatic trials should be used in studies where the objective is to provide measurements of costs and outcomes for a specific group of patients in a particular setting. This approach is highly relevant in telemedicine evaluations where the objective is to support local investments strategies and reimbursement systems. Decision modelling provides an overall structure for a decision problem and a formal analysis of the implications of different decisions. Modelling can simulate a trial or mimic a current system or a system that decision makers would like to use. Modelling is a useful approach when decisions need to be made about whether to invest in telemedicine within a broader context.},

This LED light is transmitted through each well, and is then collected via 96 individual optical fibers. Captured images of this fiber-bundle are transmitted to our servers through a custom-designed app for processing using a machine learning algorithm, yielding diagnostic results, which are delivered to the user within ∼1 min per 96-well plate, and are visualized using the same app. We successfully tested this mobile platform in a clinical microbiology laboratory using FDA-approved mumps IgG, measles IgG, and herpes simplex virus IgG (HSV-1 and HSV-2) ELISA tests using a total of 567 and 571 patient samples for training and blind testing, respectively, and achieved an accuracy of 99.6\%, 98.6\%, 99.4\%, and 99.4\% for mumps, measles, HSV-1, and HSV-2 tests, respectively. This cost-effective and hand-held platform could assist health-care professionals to perform high-throughput disease screening or tracking of vaccination campaigns at the point-of-care, even in resource-poor and field-settings. Also, its intrinsic wireless connectivity can serve epidemiological studies, generating spatiotemporal maps of disease prevalence and immunity.},

	abstract = {Chronic illnesses account for approximately 75\% of all healthcare costs in the United States today, resulting in functional limitations and loss of independence, as well as increased medical expenditures. The elderly population is at a higher risk for developing chronic conditions, increasing their risk for disabilities. Given the rapid growth of the aging population, and the chronic illnesses, disabilities, and loss of functional independence endemic to elders, novel methods of rehabilitation and care management are urgently needed. Telehealth models that combine care coordination with communications technology offer a means for managing chronic illnesses, thereby decreasing healthcare costs. We examined the effects of a Veterans Administration (VA) telerehabilitation program (Low Activities of Daily Living [ADL] Monitoring Program-LAMP) on healthcare costs. LAMP is based on a rehabilitative model of care. LAMP patients received adaptive equipment and environmental modifications, which focused on self-care and safety within the home. LAMP Care Coordinators remotely monitored their patient's vital signs and provided education and self-management strategies for decreasing the effects of chronic illnesses and functional decline. The matched comparison group (MCG) received standard VA care. Healthcare costs 12 months preenrollment and 12 months post-enrollment were examined through a difference-in-differences multivariable model. Using actual costs totaled for these analyses, no significant differences were detected in post-enrollment costs between LAMP and the MCG. For LAMP patients, the provision of adaptive equipment and environmental modifications, plus intensive in-home monitoring of patients, led to increases in clinic visits post-intervention with decreases in hospital and nursing home stays.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence and associated cost of treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unsustainable, and focus is needed on self-management and prevention of hospital admissions. Telehealth monitoring of patients' vital signs allows clinicians to prioritise their workload and enables patients to take more responsibility for their health. This paper reports the results of a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Telehealth-supported care within a community-based COPD supported-discharge service.
METHODS: A two-arm pragmatic pilot RCT was conducted comparing the standard service with a Telehealth-supported service and assessed the potential for progressing into a full RCT. The co-primary outcome measures were the proportion of COPD patients readmitted to hospital and changes in patients' self-reported quality of life. The objectives were to assess the suitability of the methodology, produce a sample size calculation for a full RCT, and to give an indication of cost-effectiveness for both pathways.
RESULTS: Sixty three participants were recruited (n = 31 Standard; n = 32 Telehealth); 15 participants were excluded from analysis due to inadequate data completion or withdrawal from the Telehealth arm. Recruitment was slow with significant gaps in data collection, due predominantly to an unanticipated 60\% reduction of staff capacity within the clinical team. The sample size calculation was guided by estimates of clinically important effects and COPD readmission rates derived from the literature. Descriptive analyses showed that the standard service group had a lower proportion of patients with hospital readmissions and a greater increase in self-reported quality of life compared to the Telehealth-supported group. Telehealth was cost-effective only if hospital admissions data were excluded.
CONCLUSIONS: Slow recruitment rates and service reconfigurations prevented progression to a full RCT. Although there are advantages to conducting an RCT with data collection conducted by a frontline clinical team, in this case, challenges arose when resources within the team were reduced by external events. Gaps in data collection were resolved by recruiting a research nurse. This study reinforces previous findings regarding the difficulty of undertaking evaluation of complex interventions, and provides recommendations for the introduction and evaluation of complex interventions within clinical settings, such as prioritisation of research within the clinical remit.

The front-end of the system is capable of reading glucose measurements from any glucose meter and sending them automatically via existing networks to the back-end server. The back-end is designed and developed using n-tier web client architecture based on model-view-controller design pattern using open source technology, a cost effective solution. The back-end helps the health-care provider with data analysis; data visualization and decision support, and allows them to send feedback and therapeutic advice to patients from anywhere using a browser enabled device.

METHODS: Using cellular-connected telemedicine devices, we assessed 89 presumptive stroke patients in ambulances in transit. Paramedics assisted remote teleneurologists in obtaining a simplified history and examination, then coordinating care with the receiving emergency department. We prospectively assessed door-to-needle and last-known-well-to-needle times for all intravenous alteplase-treated stroke patients brought to our emergency departments by emergency medical services' transport, comparing those with and without in-transit telestroke.
RESULTS: From January 2015 through March 2016, 111 stroke patients received intravenous alteplase at study emergency departments. Mean door to needle was 13 minutes less with in-transit telestroke (28 versus 41; P=0.02). Although limitations in cellular communication degraded transmission quality, this did not prevent the completion of satisfactory patient evaluations.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in time to treat seems comparable with in-transit telestroke and mobile stroke transport units. The low cost/unit makes this approach scalable, potentially providing rapid management of more patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of modern information telecommunication (ITC) technology and its use in telemedicine plays an increasingly important role in facilitating access to some diagnostic services even to people living in the most remote areas. However, physical and economical constraints in the access to broad band data-transmission network, still represent a considerable obstacle to the transmission of images for the purpose of tele-pathology.
METHODS: Indifferently using m-phones of different brands, and a variety of microscopic preparations, images were taken without the use of any adaptor simply approaching the lens of the mobile cell phone camera to the ocular of common optical microscopes, and subsequently sent via Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) to distant reference centres for tele-diagnosis. Access to MMS service was reviewed with specific reference to the African information communication technology (ICT) market.
RESULTS: Images of any pathologic preparation could be captured and sent over the mobile phone with an MMS, without being limited by appropriate access to the internet for transmission (i.e. access to broad-band services). The quality of the image was not influenced by the brand or model of the mobile-phone used, but only by its digital resolution, with any resolution above 0.8 megapixel resulting in images sufficient for diagnosis.Access to MMS services is increasingly reaching remote disadvantaged areas. Current penetration of the service in Africa was mapped appearing already available in almost every country, with penetration index varying from 1.5\% to 92.2\%.
CONCLUSION: The use of otherwise already widely available technologies, without any need for adaptors or otherwise additional technology, could significantly increase opportunities and quality diagnostics while lowering costs and considerably increasing connectivity between most isolated laboratories and distant reference center.},

We performed a questionnaire for pathologists and pathology residents across Canada, in order to determine their current experiences and attitudes towards digital pathology; which modalities digital pathology is best suited for; and to assess the need for training in digital pathology amongst pathology residents and staff. An online survey consisting of 24 yes/no, multiple choice and free text questions regarding digital pathology was sent out via E-mail to all members of the Canadian Association of Pathologists and pathology residents across Canada. Survey results showed that telepathology (TP) is used in approximately 43\% of institutions, primarily for teaching purposes (65\%), followed by operating room consults (46\%). Seventy-one percent of respondents believe there is a need for TP in their practice; 85\% use digital images in their practice. The top two favored applications for digital pathology are teaching and consultation services, with the main advantage being easier access to cases. The main limitations of using digital pathology are cost and image/diagnostic quality. Sixty-two percent of respondents would attend training courses in pathology informatics and 91\% think informatics should be part of residency training. The results of the survey indicate that Pathologists and residents across Canada do see a need for TP and the use of digital images in their daily practice. Integration of an informatics component into resident training programs and courses for staff Pathologists would be welcomed.},

	abstract = {Background/Rationale: Patients are admitted to Intensive care units (ICUs) either because they need close monitoring despite a low risk of hospital mortality (LRM group) or to receive ICU specific active treatments (AT group). The characteristics and differential outcomes of LRM patients vs. AT patients in Neurocritical Care Units are poorly understood. Methods: We classified 1,702 patients admitted to our tertiary and quaternary care center Neuroscience-ICU in 2016 and 2017 into LRM vs. AT groups. We compared demographics, admission diagnosis, goal of care status, readmission rates and managing attending specialty extracted from the medical record between groups. Acute Physiology, Age and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IVa risk predictive modeling was used to assess comparative risks for ICU and hospital mortality and length of stay between groups. Results: 56.9\% of patients admitted to our Neuroscience-ICU in 2016 and 2017 were classified as LRM, whereas 43.1\% of patients were classified as AT. While demographically similar, the groups differed significantly in all risk predictive outcome measures [APACHE IVa scores, actual and predicted ICU and hospital mortality (p {\textless} 0.0001 for all metrics)]. The most common admitting diagnosis overall, cerebrovascular accident/stroke, was represented in the LRM and AT groups with similar frequency [24.3 vs. 21.3\%, respectively (p = 0.15)], illustrating that further differentiating factors like symptom duration, neurologic status and its dynamic changes and neuro-imaging characteristics determine the indication for active treatment vs. observation. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage/hematoma were significantly more likely to receive active treatments as opposed to having a primary focus on monitoring [13.6 vs. 9.8\%, respectively (p = 0.017)]. Conclusion: The majority of patients admitted to our Neuroscience ICU (56.9\%) had {\textless}10\% hospital mortality risk and a focus on monitoring, whereas the remaining 43.1\% of patients received active treatments in their first ICU day. LRM Patients exhibited significantly lower APACHE IVa scores, ICU and hospital mortality rates compared to AT patients. Observed-over-expected ICU and hospital mortality ratios were better than predicted by APACHE IVa for low risk monitored patients and close to prediction for actively treated patients, suggesting that at least a subset of LRM patients may safely and more cost effectively be cared for in intermediate level care settings.},

One way to address this inequity is through innovative models of care such as telehealth. The aim of this pilot trial was to determine the feasibility, appropriateness and access to a telehealth clinic. In this pilot trial, the telehealth clinic outcomes are compared with the outreach clinic. Both models of care are commonly utilised means of providing healthcare to meet the needs of people living in rural and remote regions. Methods A prospective audit was conducted on a Spinal Assessment Clinic Telehealth pilot trial for patients with spinal disorders requiring non-urgent surgical consultation. Data were recorded from all consultations managed using videoconferencing technology between the Royal Adelaide Hospital and Port Augusta Community Health Service, South Australia between September 2013 and January 2014. Outcomes included analysis of process, service activity, clinical actions, safety and costs. Data were compared to a previous spinal assessment outreach clinic in the same area between August and December 2012. Results There were 25 consultations with 22 patients over the five-month telehealth pilot trial. Spinal disorders were predominantly of the lumbar region (88\%); the majority of initial consultations (64\%) were discharged to the general practitioner. There were three requests for further imaging, five for minor interventions and three for other specialist/surgical consultation. Patient follow-up post telehealth pilot trial revealed no adverse outcomes. The total cost of AUD\$11,187 demonstrated a 23\% reduction in favour of the spinal assessment telehealth pilot trial, with the greatest savings in travel costs. Discussion The telehealth model of care demonstrated the efficient management of patients with spinal disorders in rural regions requiring non-urgent surgical consultation at low costs with no adverse outcomes reported.},

Telemedicine and health sensors stand as indispensable tools for promoting patient engagement, self-management of diseases and assist doctors to remotely follow up patients. In this paper, we evaluate a rapid prototyping solution for information merging based on five health sensors and two low-cost ubiquitous computing components: Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Our study, which is entirely described with the purpose of reproducibility, aimed to evaluate the extent to which portable technologies are capable of integrating wearable sensors by comparing two deployment scenarios: Raspberry Pi 3 and Personal Computer. The integration is implemented using a choreography engine to transmit data from sensors to a display unit using web services and a simple communication protocol with two modes of data retrieval. Performance of the two set-ups is compared by means of the latency in the wearable data transmission and data loss. PC has a delay of 0.051 ± 0.0035 s (max = 0.2504 s), whereas the Raspberry Pi yields a delay of 0.0175 ± 0.149 s (max = 0.294 s) for N = 300. Our analysis confirms that portable devices ( p {\textless} {\textless} 0 . 01 ) are suitable to support the transmission and analysis of biometric signals into scalable telemedicine systems.},

	abstract = {EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The emergence of value-based healthcare requires new approaches for physicians and their organizations in serving their patients. Traditional medical practices have centered on physicians detecting and responding to patients' needs, but with new payment models and technologies, practitioners will be required to prevent health issues from developing. Transitions of care and service coordination among providers and specialists need to be seamless as patients are educated about their health issues and better connected to their medical information. A key enabler of this change will be how well patients can collaborate with their care teams, and several e-health disciplines catalyze this process. In fact, there is an e-health imperative to affect outcomes and patient experiences while lowering costs.The Triple Aim objectives of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement are more achievable with the integration of e-health tools and services with clinical care. The mobile revolution and improvements in data management practices now make improved care coordination possible throughout a patient's journey. Telehealth services facilitate connected care and inform physicians with data that flow into a patient portal, which improves risk monitoring and enables proactive treatment. The growing use of social media fosters community development, which enables patients to share experiences with others, further empowering consumerism in healthcare delivery. Finally, e-health tools enable customization of care for large populations as we stratify patient groups. Clinical data scientists and informaticists partner with physicians to establish and operationalize programs that identify new best practices and drive behavior change-especially for those patients with costly chronic conditions and comorbidities. E-health disciplines are the lifeblood of a system that engages patients in new ways to help them and their physicians adhere to practices that support value-based care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Indirect expenses for accessing health care may place significant fiscal strain on Canadian families. Telemedicine alternatives, using email, telephone, and video conferencing, can mitigate such financial burdens by reducing travel and related costs. Our objectives were to assess costs that families incur visiting an outpatient pediatric surgical clinic, and family attitudes toward telemedicine alternatives.
METHODS: A survey was offered pre-consult to all families who attended pediatric urology and general surgery outpatient clinics over a three-month period.
RESULTS: A total of 1032 of 1574 families screened participated (66.0\%). Less than half (18.5\%) of participants traveled over 200 km, and 32.9\% spent over 4 hours in transit, round-trip. The proportion of participants who spent over \$50 on travel and ancillary expenses was 33.0\%. In 74.0\% of families, 1 or more adults missed work. The proportion of families who perceived costs as somewhat high or high was 29.1\%. Perceived cost was positively correlated to distance traveled, money spent, and missed work (p{\textless}0.01). Most were comfortable with medical communication using technology; and 34.3\%-42.7\% would avoid an in-person clinic visit utilizing email, telephone, and video conferencing. Higher perceived cost (p{\textless}0.001) and distance traveled (p{\textless}0.01) were only weakly associated with greater willingness to substitute a clinic visit with video conferencing.
CONCLUSIONS: Many families face high costs related to routine outpatient clinical visits, and there is a substantial willingness by them to access telemedicine alternatives, rather than the traditional face-to-face clinical visit.},

	abstract = {PROBLEM AND OBJECTIVE: This research derives from the confluence of several factors, namely, the prevalence of a complex array of mental health issues across age, social, ethnic, and economic groups, an increasingly critical shortage of mental health professionals and the associated disability and productivity loss in the population, and the potential of telemental health (TMH) to ameliorate these problems. Definitive information regarding the true merit of telemedicine applications and intervention is now of paramount importance among policymakers, providers of care, researchers, payers, program developers, and the public at large. This is necessary for rational policymaking, prudent resource allocation decisions, and informed strategic planning. This article is aimed at assessing the state of scientific knowledge regarding the merit of telemedicine interventions in the treatment of mental disorders (TMH) in terms of feasibility/acceptance, effects on medication compliance, health outcomes, and cost.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We started by casting a wide net to identify the relevant studies and to examine in detail the content of studies that met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Only studies that met rigorous methodological criteria were included. Necessary details include the specific nature and content of the intervention, the research methodology, clinical focus, technological configuration, and the modality of the intervention.
RESULTS: The published scientific literature on TMH reveals strong and consistent evidence of the feasibility of this modality of care and its acceptance by its intended users, as well as uniform indication of improvement in symptomology and quality of life among patients across a broad range of demographic and diagnostic groups. Similarly, positive trends are shown in terms of cost savings.
CONCLUSION: There is substantial empirical evidence for supporting the use of telemedicine interventions in patients with mental disorders.},

We provide a conceptual context for the proliferation of related concepts, such as telehealth, e-health, and m-health, as well as a classification of the content of these concepts. Our main concern is to develop an explicit taxonomy of telemedicine and to demonstrate how it can be used to provide definitive information about the true effects of telemedicine in terms of cost, quality, and access. Taxonomy development and refinement is an iterative process. If this initial attempt at classification proves useful, subject matter experts could enhance the development and proliferation of telemedicine by testing, revising, and verifying this taxonomy.},

With the rise of the Internet of medical things (IoMT), along with smart devices, the med-tech industry is on the cusp of a home-care revolution, which could also create opportunity for developing effective solutions with significant potential to reduce DFU-associated costs and saving limbs. This article discusses potential applications of IoMT to the DFU patient population and beyond.
METHODS: To better understand potential opportunities and challenges associated with implementing IoMT for management of DFU, the authors reviewed recent relevant literatures and included their own expert opinions from a multidisciplinary point of view including podiatry, engineering, and data security.
RESULTS: The IoMT has opened digital transformation of home-based diabetic foot care, as it enables promoting patient engagement, personalized care and smart management of chronic and noncommunicable diseases through individual data-driven treatment regimens, telecommunication, data mining, and comprehensive feedback tailored to individual requirements. In particular, with recent advances in voice-activated commands technology and its integration as a part of IoMT, new opportunities have emerged to improve the patient's central role and responsibility in enabling an optimized health care ecosystem.
CONCLUSIONS: The IoMT has opened new opportunities in health care from remote monitoring to smart sensors and medical device integration. While it is at its early stage of development, ultimately we envisage a connected home that, using voice-controlled technology and Bluetooth-radio-connected add-ons, may augment much of what home health does today.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A novel system that combines a compact mobile instrument and Internet communications is presented in this paper for remote evaluation of tremors. The system presents a high potential application in Parkinson's disease and connects to the Internet through a TCP/IP protocol. Tremor transduction is carried out by accelerometers, and the data processing, presentation and storage were obtained by a virtual instrument. The system supplies the peak frequency (fp), the amplitude (Afp) and power in this frequency (Pfp), the total power (Ptot), and the power in low (1-4 Hz) and high (4-7 Hz) frequencies (Plf and Phf, respectively).
METHODS: The ability of the proposed system to detect abnormal tremors was initially demonstrated by a fatigue study in normal subjects. In close agreement with physiological fundamentals, the presence of fatigue increased fp, Afp, Pfp and Pt (p {\textless} 0.05), while the removal of fatigue reduced all the mentioned parameters (p {\textless} 0.05). The system was also evaluated in a preliminary in vivo test in parkinsonian patients. Afp, Pfp, Ptot, Plf and Phf were the most accurate parameters in the detection of the adverse effects of this disease (Se = 100\%, Sp = 100\%), followed by fp (Se = 100\%, Sp = 80\%). Tests for Internet transmission that realistically simulated clinical conditions revealed adequate acquisition and analysis of tremor signals and also revealed that the user could adequately receive medical recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed system can be used in a wide spectrum of telemedicine scenarios, enabling the home evaluation of tremor occurrence under specific medical treatments and contributing to reduce the costs of the assistance offered to these patients.},

The Integrated Clinical Environment (ICE) architecture appeared recently with the goal of becoming a common framework for defining the structure of the medical applications as concerns the safe integration of medical devices and sensors. ICE is simply a high level architecture that defines the functional blocks that should be part of a medical system to support interoperability. As a result, the underlying communication backbone is broadly undefined as concerns the enabling software technology (including the middleware) and associated algorithms that meet the ICE requirements of the flexible integration of medical devices and services. Supporting the on line composition of services in a medical system is also not part of ICE; however, supporting this behavior would enable flexible orchestration of functions (e.g., addition and/or removal of services and medical equipment) on the fly. iLandis one of the few software technologies that supports on line service composition and reconfiguration, ensuring time-bounded transitions across different service orchestrations; it supports the design, deployment and on line reconfiguration of applications, which this paper applies to service-based eHealth domains. This paper designs the integration between ICE architecture and iLand middleware to enhance the capabilities of ICE with on line service composition and the time-bounded reconfiguration of medical systems based on distributed services. A prototype implementation of a service-based eHealth system for the remote monitoring of patients is described; it validates the enhanced capacity of ICE to support dynamic reconfiguration of the application services. Results show that the temporal cost of the on line reconfiguration of the eHealth application is bounded, achieving a low overhead resulting from the addition of ICE compliance.},

Sixteen countries are participating in EURO-TELEPATH. Activities are organized in four Working Groups (WGs): WG1 - Pathology Business Modeling, WG2 - Informatics Standards in Pathology, WG3 - Images: Analysis, Processing, Retrieval and Management, and WG4 - Technology and Automation in Pathology. During the first year of work, the collaboration between software engineers, computer scientists, pathologists and other clinicians has been essential to detect three main areas of interest in digital pathology research: virtual microscopy scanning solutions, health informatics standards, and image processing and analysis. Research in these areas is essential to a correct approach to telepathology, including primary diagnosis, and secondary or teleconsultation services. Managing microscopic pathology images (virtual slides) is a challenge to existing information systems, mainly due to its large size, large number, and complex interpretation. Regarding interoperability, the integration of pathology reports and images into eHealth records is an essential objective that research groups should consider. Promoting participation in standards bodies (DICOM, IHE, HL7, IHTSDO) is an essential part of the project work. Understanding the business process of pathology departments in daily practice, including healthcare, education, research, and quality control activities, is the starting point to be sure that standardization efforts converge with user needs. Following a recent IHE proposal, coordination with public health services like national or regional tumor registries must also be supported. Virtual or digital slides are fostering the use of image processing and analysis in pathology not only for research purposes, but also in daily practice. Nowadays, further discussion is needed on the adequacy of current existing technical solutions, including for instance quality of images obtained by scanners, or the efficiency of image analysis applications.},

	abstract = {It is well documented that there is an acute shortage of neurologists and neurosurgeons in India and globally. Despite all efforts, it will be impossible to make available neurospecialists in all suburban and rural areas. Simultaneously, there has been an exponential increase in the growth and development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Plummeting costs and unbelievable sophistication in the availability of user-friendly mobile video conferencing devices is making distance meaningless. Geography has become History! Worldwide, the ultraconservative health care industry, in particular, the medical community, has been uniformly slow to adopt and embrace the use of ICT to extend their clinical reach. In the last decade, however, specialists in all branches of neurosciences are slowly accepting the inevitable that telemedicine must and will have to be incorporated into the core of the healthcare delivery system. This literature review summarizes the current use of telemedicine in different subspecialties of neurosciences. The author defines the growth and development of clinical telemedicine in India with special reference to Neurosciences and attempts to show the stellar role telemedicine has to play in enhancing the services provided by doctors. As clinicians regularly using technology, it should not be difficult for us to convince our patients that today a virtual remote consult and management can indeed effectively substitute for a physical face-to-face encounter.},

	abstract = {Background/Introduction: Implementation of telestroke has been associated with improved thrombolysis rates and clinical outcomes in remote or neurologically underserved spoke hospitals. Yet, the experience of spoke hospitals using telestroke has not been well described. We sought to characterize spoke hospitals' perceptions of telestroke to understand perceived advantages, challenges, and barriers to use.
DESIGN/METHODS: Within our northeastern US telestroke network, we conducted scripted interviews with representatives (stroke coordinators, nurse managers, and emergency physicians) from each of the 15 spoke hospitals connected to a single academic hub hospital. Interview questions included both open-ended and Likert scale responses. We used descriptive and nonparametric analyses (e.g., logit) to present the results.
RESULTS: Of the 15 spoke hospitals interviewed, the majority felt that telestroke enabled them to treat more patients with the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; 93.3\%, n = 14) and to achieve faster door-to-needle times for tPA treatment (80\%, n = 12). Higher Likert scores were not correlated with hospitals' consult volume or tPA volume. The most commonly reported barriers to using telestroke were providers who were not familiar or comfortable using the technology (66\%, n = 10). Few hospitals had concerns that telestroke led to overtreatment with tPA (13.3\%, n = 2) or led to unnecessary transfers (20\%, n = 3). None of the hospitals felt that the physician-patient relationship was compromised, nor was there a concern that patients would have a negative perception of the spoke hospital with utilization of services.
CONCLUSIONS: Within this single hub-spoke telestroke system in the northeast, we found that spoke hospitals perceive the advantages of telestroke to be in enabling improved rates and efficiency of tPA administration. Barriers to use were most often related to technological challenges rather than concerns about patient care or patients' perceptions. Future work should further explore how to better meet the needs of spoke hospitals in caring for stroke patients.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has expanded health coverage for thousands of Illinois residents. Expanded coverage, however, does not guarantee appropriate health care. Diabetes and its ocular complications serve as an example of how providers in underserved urban areas may not be able to keep up with new demand for labor- and technology-intensive health care unless changes in reimbursement policies are instituted.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using medical encounter information from the Chicago HealthLNK Data Repository (HDR), an assembly of non-duplicated and de-identified patient medical records. We used a method of estimating the geographic distribution of undiagnosed diabetic retinopathy in the city of Chicago to illustrate the magnitude of potentially preventable eye disease. All rates were calculated for all ZIP Codes within Chicago (Cook County), and statistical differences between observed and geographically adjusted expected rates (p {\textless} 0.10, p {\textless} 0.05, p {\textless} 0.01) were highlighted as underserved areas.
RESULTS: This analysis included 150,661 patients with diabetes identified from a total of nearly two million patients in Chicago. High rates of undetected diabetic retinopathy were found in low-income and minority areas. Within these areas, 37\% of the identified diabetics were uninsured, with rates ranging widely from 20\% to 68.6\%. Among those with insurance, 32.8\% were covered by Medicare and only 10\% by Medicaid. Most patients with untreated diabetic retinopathy were found to reside in areas where primary health care is provided through Federally Qualified Health Centers.
CONCLUSIONS: With 150,661 diabetics identified in the city of Chicago, and this number continuing to rise each year, a manpower approach with ophthalmologist screening for diabetic retinopathy is not realistic. The ability to identify the growing number of diabetic patients with retinopathy in low-income areas will likely require the adoption of cost-effective screening technologies that are currently not funded by Medicare and Medicaid.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Notwithstanding the cardiovascular disease epidemic, current budgetary constraints do not allow for budget expansion of conventional cardiac rehabilitation programmes. Consequently, there is an increasing need for cost-effectiveness studies of alternative strategies such as telerehabilitation. The present study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive cardiac telerehabilitation programme.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This multi-centre randomized controlled trial comprised 140 cardiac rehabilitation patients, randomized (1:1) to a 24-week telerehabilitation programme in addition to conventional cardiac rehabilitation (intervention group) or to conventional cardiac rehabilitation alone (control group). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated based on intervention and health care costs (incremental cost), and the differential incremental quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.
RESULTS: The total average cost per patient was significantly lower in the intervention group (€2156 ± €126) than in the control group (€2720 ± €276) (p = 0.01) with an overall incremental cost of €-564.40. Dividing this incremental cost by the baseline adjusted differential incremental QALYs (0.026 QALYs) yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €-21,707/QALY. The number of days lost due to cardiovascular rehospitalizations in the intervention group (0.33 ± 0.15) was significantly lower than in the control group (0.79 ± 0.20) (p = 0.037).
CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows the addition of cardiac telerehabilitation to conventional centre-based cardiac rehabilitation to be more effective and efficient than centre-based cardiac rehabilitation alone. These results are useful for policy makers charged with deciding how limited health care resources should best be allocated in the era of exploding need.},

	abstract = {Background Finding innovative and cost-efficient care strategies that induce long-term health benefits in cardiac patients constitutes a big challenge today. The aim of this Telerehab III follow-up study was to assess whether a 6-month additional cardiac telerehabilitation programme could induce long-term health benefits and remain cost-efficient after the tele-intervention ended. Methods and results A total of 126 cardiac patients first completed the multicentre, randomised controlled telerehabilitation trial (Telerehab III, time points t0 to t1). They consequently entered the follow-up study (t1) with evaluations 2 years later (t2). A quantitative analysis of peak aerobic capacity (VO2 peak, primary endpoint), international physical activity questionnaire self-reported physical activity and HeartQoL quality of life (secondary endpoints) was performed. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. Even though a decline in VO2 peak (24 ± 8 ml/[min*kg] at t1 and 22 ± 6 ml/[min*kg] at t2; P ≤ 0.001) was observed within the tele-intervention group patients; overall they did better than the no tele-intervention group ( P = 0.032). Dividing the incremental cost (-€878/patient) by the differential incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.22 QALYs) yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -€3993/QALY. Conclusions A combined telerehabilitation and centre-based programme, followed by transitional telerehabilitation induced persistent health benefits and remained cost-efficient up to 2 years after the end of the intervention. A partial decline of the benefits originally achieved did occur once the tele-intervention ended. Healthcare professionals should reflect on how innovative cost-efficient care models could be implemented in standard care. Future research should focus on key behaviour change techniques in technology-based interventions that enable full persistence of long-term behaviour change and health benefits.

	abstract = {AIMS: The TElemonitoring in the MAnagement of Heart Failure (TEMA-HF) 1 long-term follow-up study assessed whether an initial six-month telemonitoring (TM) programme compared with usual care (UC) would result in reduced all-cause mortality, heart failure admissions and healthcare costs in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients at long-term follow-up.
METHODS: Of the 160 patients included in the multi-centre, randomised controlled telemonitoring trial (TEMA-HF 1, time point t0); 142 CHF patients (65\% male; age: 76 ± 10 years; EF: 36 ± 15\%) were alive and entered the follow-up study (time point: t1) with a final evaluation at 79 months (time point: t2). Both TM and UC group patients received standard heart failure care during the follow-up study (time points: t1 - t2). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included days lost due to heart failure readmissions and readmission/patient follow-up related healthcare costs.
RESULTS: Compared with usual care, the initial six-month TM programme had no significant effect on all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 0.83; 95\% confidence interval, 0.57 to 1.20; p = 0.32). The number of days lost due to heart failure readmissions was significantly lower in the TM group ( p = 0.04). Healthcare costs did not differ significantly between the TM (€ 9140 ± 10580) and UC group (€ 12495 ± 22433) ( p = 0.87).
DISCUSSION: An initial six-month telemonitoring programme was not associated with reduced all-cause mortality in CHF patients at long-term follow-up but resulted in a reduction in the number of days lost due to heart failure readmissions.

	abstract = {Importance: Hospital care for children is becoming more concentrated, with interhospital transfer occurring more frequently even for common conditions. Condition-specific analysis is required to determine the value, costs, and consequences of this trend.
Objectives: To describe the capabilities of transferring and receiving hospitals and to determine how often children transferred after an initial diagnosis of abdominal pain or appendicitis require higher levels of care.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort analysis using the 2 most recent available inpatient and emergency department administrative data sets from all acute care hospitals in California from 2010 to 2011 and Florida, Massachusetts, and New York from 2013 to 2014. Data were analyzed between February and June 2018. All patients younger than 18 years with a primary diagnosis of abdominal pain or appendicitis who underwent an interhospital transfer and whose care could be matched through unique identifiers were included.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes after hospital transfers, classified into encounters with major surgical procedures, imaging diagnostics, and no major procedures. Pediatric Hospital Capability Index of transferring and receiving hospitals.
Results: There were 465 143 pediatric hospital encounters for abdominal pain and appendicitis, including 53 517 inpatient admissions and 15 275 transfers. Among them, 4469 could be matched to encounters in receiving hospitals. The median (interquartile range) age of this cohort was 10 (7-14) years, with 54.8\% female (2449 patients), 40.9\% male (1830 patients), and 4.3\% unreported sex (190 patients). The increase in capability at the receiving hospital compared with the transferring hospital was large (median [interquartile range] change in Pediatric Hospital Capability Index score, 0.70 [0.54-0.82]), with 9.2\% of hospitals (57) with very high capability (Pediatric Hospital Capability Index score {\textgreater}0.77) receiving 80.8\% of the total transfers (3610). Diagnostic imaging was undertaken in the care of 710 transferred patients (15.9\%) and invasive procedures were performed in 2421 patients (54.2\%), including 2153 appendectomies. No imaging or surgery was required in the care of 1338 transfers (29.9\%).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, interfacility transfers of patients with appendicitis and abdominal pain were concentrated toward high-capability hospitals, and about 30\% of patients were released without apparent intervention. These findings suggest an opportunity for improving care and decreasing cost through better interfacility coordination, such as standardized management protocols and telemedicine with high-capability hospitals. Further research is needed to identify similar opportunities among other common conditions.},

Simultaneously, diverse generational pressures-including the consumerism of millennials and unsustainable growth in the costs of care for baby boomers-have accelerated a revolution in healthcare delivery that was marked in 2010 by the passage of the Affordable Care Act.Against this backdrop, Maryland and the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services entered into a partnership in 2014 to modernize the Maryland All-Payer Model. Under this architecture, each Maryland hospital negotiates a global budget revenue agreement with the state's rate-setting agency, limiting the hospital's annual revenue to the budgetary cap established by the state.At Atlantic General Hospital (AGH), leaders had established a disciplined strategic planning process in which the board of trustees, medical staff, and administration annually agree on goals and initiatives to achieve the objectives set forth in its five-year strategic plans. This article describes two initiatives to improve care using technology. In 2006, AGH introduced a service guarantee in the emergency room (ER); the ER 30-Minute Promise assures patients that they will be placed in a bed or receive care within 30 minutes of arrival in the ER. In 2007, several independent hospitals in the state formed Maryland eCare to jointly contract for intensive care unit (ICU) physician coverage via telemedicine. This technology allows clinical staff to continuously monitor ICU patients remotely. The positive results of the ER 30-Minute Promise and Maryland eCare program show that technological advances in an independent, small, rural hospital can make a significant impact on its ability to maintain independence. AGH's strategic investments prepared the organization well for the transition in 2014 to a value-based payment system.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used an observational study with ICU patients cared for during the pre-tele-ICU period and ICU patients cared for during the post-tele-ICU period in 6 ICUs at 5 hospitals that are part of a large nonprofit health care system in the Gulf Coast region. We obtained data on a sample of 4142 ICU patients: 2034 in the pre-tele-ICU period and 2108 in the post-tele-ICU period. Economic outcomes were hospital costs, ICU costs and floor costs, measured for average daily costs, costs per case, and costs per patient.
RESULTS: After the implementation of the tele-ICU, the hospital daily cost increased from \$4302 to \$5340 (24\%); the hospital cost per case, from \$21,967 to \$31,318 (43\%); and the cost per patient, from \$20,231 to \$25,846 (28\%). Although the tele-ICU intervention was not cost-effective in patients with Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 50 or less, it was cost-effective in the sickest patients with Simplified Acute Physiology Score II more than 50 (17\% of patients) because it decreased hospital mortality without increasing costs significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital administrators may conclude that a tele-ICU program aimed at the sickest patients is cost-effective.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To monitor and control the blood glucose levels in inefficiently insulin-treated patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) using a telemonitoring system and determine whether the improvement of HbA1c has a lasting effect following its discontinuation.
DESIGN: Seventy inefficiently controlled insulin-treated DM patients using telemonitoring (telemonitoring group-TG) [HbA1c 9.9±2.3\% (85±24.9mmol/mol)] and 35 age-, body mass index (BMI)- and Hba1c-matched insulin-treated patients receiving outpatient care (control group-CG) [HbA1c 9.7±2.1\% (82±23.4mmol/mol)] were enrolled. Data of TG were transmitted from the glucose-meters to our computers via modem. Communication was achieved via e-mails and mobile phone text-messages through integrated software. HbA1c and BMI were evaluated at enrollment, 3 and 6 months, and 6 months after telemonitoring discontinuation. Frequency of hypo- and hyperglycemias and cost were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Significant reduction in HbA1c was observed in TG both at 3 [7.1±1.0\% (54±10.5mmol/mol) p\&\#60;0.001] and 6 months [6.9±0.9\% (52±9.5mmol/mol) p\&\#60;0.001], compared to the CG group at the same timepoints. Significant reduction was also observed in the TG subgroups with ΗbA1c\&\#8805;10\% and 10\&\#62;HbA1c\&\#8805;7.5\% at 3 and 6 months, compared to CG. No statistically significant differences in BMI were observed between TG and CG. Six months after telemonitoring discontinuation, HbA1c in TG was slightly increased [7.3±1.0\% (56±10.4mol/mol)]. Attenuation was also observed in both TG subgroups. Compared to CG, the number of monthly hypo- and hyperglycemias was reduced in TG. The intervention had a financial benefit for patients living more than 100 km from the health care provider.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring can result in reduction of HbA1c and frequency of hypo- and hyperglycemias. This beneficial effect is slightly attenuated 6 months after terminating telemonitoring.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with depression use more health services than patients without depression. However, when depression symptoms respond to treatment, use of health services declines. Most depression quality improvement studies increase total cost in the short run, which if unevenly distributed across stakeholders, could compromise buy-in and sustainability. The objective of this budget impact analysis was to examine patterns of utilization and cost associated with telemedicine-based collaborative care, an intervention that targets patients treated in small rural primary care clinics.
METHODS: Patients with depression were recruited from VA Community-based Outpatient Clinics, and 395 patients were enrolled and randomized to telemedicine-based collaborative care or usual care. Dependent variables representing utilization and cost were collected from administrative data. Independent variables representing clinical casemix were collected from self-report at baseline.
RESULTS: There were no significant group differences in the total number or cost of primary care encounters. However, as intended, patients in the intervention group had significantly greater depression-related primary care encounters (marginal effect=0.34, P=0.004) and cost (marginal effect=\$61.4, P=0.013) to adjust antidepressant therapy for nonresponders. There were no significant group differences in total mental health encounters or cost. However, as intended, the intervention group had significantly higher depression-related mental health costs (marginal effect=\$107.55, P=0.03) due to referrals of treatment-resistant patients. Unexpectedly, patients in the intervention group had significantly greater specialty physical health encounters (marginal effect =0.42, P=0.001) and cost (marginal effect =\$490.6, P=0.003), but not depression-related encounters or cost. Overall, intervention patients had a significantly greater total outpatient cost compared with usual care (marginal effect=\$599.28, P=0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that telemedicine-based collaborative care does not increase total workload for primary care or mental health providers. Thus, there is no disincentive for mental health providers to offer telemedicine-based collaborative care or for primary care providers to refer patients to telemedicine-based collaborative care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improving the efficiency of critical care service is needed as the shortfall of intensivists is increasing. Standardizing clinical practice, telemedicine, and organizing critical care service at a health system level improves outcomes. We developed a health system Critical Care Program based at an academic medical center. The main feature of our program is an intensivist who shares on-site and telemedicine clinical responsibilities. Tele-ICU facilitates the standardization of high-quality critical care across the system. A common electronic medical record made the communications among the ICUs feasible. Combining faculty from medical and surgical critical care divisions increased the productivity of intensivists.
STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed the administrative database data from 2011 and 2012, including mean census, number of transfers, age, sex, case mix index, mortality, readmissions, and financial data.
RESULTS: The Critical Care program has 106 adult ICU beds; 54 of those beds can be managed remotely using tele-ICU based at the main University hospital. The mean midnight census of the system for 2012 was 69.44 and total patient-days were 34,406. The capital cost of the tele-ICU was \$1,186,220. The annual operational cost is \$1,250,112 or \$23,150 per monitored ICU-bed. Unadjusted mortality was 6.5\% before and 4.9\% after implementation (p {\textless} 0.0002).
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel health system level ICU program built using "off the shelf" technology based on a large University medical center and a tele-ICU with a full degree of treatment authority across the system.},

The aim of this study is to compare costs throughout the evaluation process for those patients assessed initially by telehealth with those seen in-person.
METHODS: All patients approved for kidney transplant waitlist evaluation at our center from March 2013 thru May 2016 with decisions were included in this study. Patients approved for evaluation were scheduled for either an initial telehealth or in-person visit, partly based on patient factors. Clinically related and travel-related costs were calculated. Time estimates for patient time needed to complete visit, time from application approval to initial visit, and time from application approval to decision were obtained. Comparisons were made using t tests.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine months were included for 302 patients. All categories of clinically or travel-related costs were significantly less for the telehealth cohort (P {\textless} 0.0001). Total mean cost per patient was US \$656.11 versus US \$1108.91 for the cohort initially evaluated by telehealth versus in-person (P {\textless} 0.001). The time needed to complete an evaluation (1.7 vs 2.4 days, P {\textless} 0.001) and the time to initial evaluation (51.4 vs 87.9.0 days, P {\textless} 0.001) were significantly less in the telehealth cohort.

The aim of our study was to compare remote pacemaker monitoring with in-home checks of pacemakers, in terms of applicability, efficacy, and cost in a selected population of debilitated elderly patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected 72 subjects (mean age 87 ± 8 years) among elderly debilitated patients with Medtronic pacemakers, compatible with the Carelink(®) remote monitoring system (13 patients with DDD pacemaker; 59 patients with single-lead VDD pacemaker). Remote follow-up was compared with in-home checks performed by nurses in 326 patients in similar clinical conditions. A total of 190 transmissions were received by remote monitoring (mean transmissions per month: 7.0; mean per patient: 2.6; range 1-6) during 27 months of follow-up. In this period, seven pacemakers were replaced owing to battery exhaustion, after a mean of 6.7 years from implantation. The occurrence of atrial or ventricular high-rate episodes was reported in 98 transmissions (53\%). Nineteen patients died (annual mortality: 11.7\%). On comparing the costs borne by the hospital for in-home checks, both for medical personnel and transportation, the estimated average saving was €32 per year per patient.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the remote follow-up of pacemakers is a reliable, effective, and cost-saving procedure in elderly, debilitated patients. Moreover, remote controls provided an accurate and early diagnosis of arrhythmia occurrence.},

Now, with a few clicks, patients can obtain dermatological consultations and prescription medications without a prior physician-patient relationship. To analyse all DTC teledermatology services available to US patients. Methods We performed Internet searches to identify DTC teledermatology services available through Internet webpages or through smartphone applications. For each service, the scope of care provided, cost, wait times, prescription policies and other relevant information were recorded. Results Twenty-two DTC teledermatology services are available to US patients in 45 states. Six (27\%) services offer care from international physicians. Sixteen (73\%) services allow patients to seek care for any reason, while six (27\%) limit care to acne or anti-aging. The median reported response time for DTC teledermatology services is 48 hours from the time of patient request. The median consultation fee for companies providing care from US board-certified physicians is US\$59. Across all services, consultation fees range from US\$1.59 to US\$250. Conclusions DTC teledermatology services are readily available to patients in most states. These services may reduce the cost of patient visits, expand access to care and increase patient convenience. However, the presence of services staffed by physicians who are not US board-certified, as well as the use of incautious language regarding prescription medications, is concerning.},

	abstract = {Introduction The Champlain BASE (Building Access to Specialists through eConsultation) eConsultation service was designed to address the limited access to specialist care in Canada, which can lead to long waiting times and, subsequently, negative patient outcomes. Our primary objective was to perform an in-depth analysis of the use, content, and perceived value of haematology electronic consults (eConsults) submitted by primary care providers (PCPs) to the eConsult service. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study using descriptive statistics to examine post-eConsult surveys for PCPs and other collected data including PCP designation, time for specialist to complete the eConsult, specialist response time, perceived value of the eConsult by the PCP, and the need for a face-to-face referral following the eConsult. A medically-trained author reviewed all haematology eConsults from April 2011 to January 2015, and categorized them by clinical topic and question type using validated taxonomies. Results Haematology accounted for 436 out of 5601 (7.8\%) total eConsults, making it the third most popular service utilized. In 66\% of haematology eConsults, a face-to-face consultation was not needed. Anaemia, neutropenia, and hyperferritinemia were the most common clinical queries. Most eConsult question types concerned the management of haematological disorders or the interpretation of laboratory tests. Most eConsults were answered within three days, using less than 15 minutes of the specialists' time. PCPs highly valued the service. Discussion This initiative increases access to haematology care and has the potential to reduce the long waiting times for non-urgent traditional consultation, along with the benefit of cost savings to the healthcare system.},

	abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) poses monumental public health challenges because of its contribution to mental health, physical health, and both interpersonal and social problems. Recent military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan and the multitude of resulting cases of PTSD have highlighted the public health significance of these conditions. There are now psychological treatments that can effectively treat most individuals with PTSD, including active duty military personnel, veterans, and civilians. We begin by reviewing the effectiveness of these treatments, with a focus on prolonged exposure (PE), a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for PTSD. Many studies conducted in independent research labs have demonstrated that PE is highly efficacious in treating PTSD across a wide range of trauma types, survivor characteristics, and cultures. Furthermore, therapists without prior CBT experience can readily learn and implement the treatment successfully. Despite the existence of highly effective treatments like PE, the majority of individuals with PTSD receive treatments of unknown efficacy. Thus, it is crucial to identify the barriers and challenges that must be addressed in order to promote the widespread dissemination of effective treatments for PTSD. In this review, we first discuss some of the major challenges, such as a professional culture that often is antagonistic to evidence-based treatments (EBTs), a lack of clinician training in EBTs, limited effectiveness of commonly used dissemination techniques, and the significant cost associated with effective dissemination models. Next, we review local, national, and international efforts to disseminate PE and similar treatments and illustrate the challenges and successes involved in promoting the adoption of EBTs in mental health systems. We then consider ways in which the barriers discussed earlier can be overcome, as well as the difficulties involved in effecting sustained organizational change in mental health systems. We also present examples of efforts to disseminate PE in developing countries and the attendant challenges when mental health systems are severely underdeveloped. Finally, we present future directions for the dissemination of EBTs for PTSD, including the use of newer technologies such as web-based therapy and telemedicine. We conclude by discussing the need for concerted action among multiple interacting systems in order to overcome existing barriers to dissemination and promote widespread access to effective treatment for PTSD. These systems include graduate training programs, government agencies, health insurers, professional organizations, healthcare delivery systems, clinical researchers, and public education systems like the media. Each of these entities can play a major role in reducing the personal suffering and public health burden associated with posttraumatic stress.},

Existing studies have demonstrated some potential clinical benefits of mHealth in the various phases of solid organ transplantation (SOT). Furthermore, studies in nontransplant chronic diseases may be used to guide future studies in SOT. Nevertheless, substantially more must be accomplished before mHealth becomes mainstream. Further evidence of clinical benefits and a critical need for cost-effectiveness analysis must prove its utility to patients, clinicians, hospitals, insurers, and the federal government. The SOT population is an ideal one in which to demonstrate the benefits of mHealth. In this review, the current evidence and status of mHealth in SOT is discussed, and a general path forward is presented that will allow buy-in from the health care community, insurers, and the federal government to move mHealth from research to standard care.},

With progression, many individuals become homebound and removed from coordinated, expert care, resulting in excess morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures in acute care settings and institutions. Home visit care models have achieved the triple aim of improving individual and population health while reducing costs in many frail, community-dwelling geriatric cohorts. This study details a novel, interdisciplinary home visit program specifically designed for individuals with PD and related disorders and their family caregivers built upon best practice principles in the care of multimorbid older adults. At each quarterly home visit, a movement disorders-trained neurologist, social worker, and nurse work in parallel with the individual and caregiver to complete a history, physical, detailed medication reconciliation, psychosocial needs assessment, and home safety assessment. A comprehensive, person-centered plan is agreed upon, referrals to community resources are made, standardized documentation is shared, and follow-up communication is instituted. In the first 2 years, 272 visits were conducted with 85 individuals who represent one of the oldest, most disabled PD populations reported. Satisfaction with and retention in the program were high. This study represents the first translation of the success of interdisciplinary and home-based geriatric care models to a population with a specific neurological disease. Preliminary evidence supports the need for such programs in vulnerable populations. Future studies will prospectively assess person-centered outcomes, the effect of using telemedicine on sustainability, and cost effectiveness.},

PURPOSE: To analyze changes in number of dermatology mobile apps since 2014 and discuss benefits and drawbacks of mobile application growth to dermatology.
METHODS: Apple, Android, and Windows were queried for dermatology-related apps. The apps were categorized by purpose and compared to previously published data to assess growth and change in dermatology apps.

CONCLUSIONS: Dermatology apps continue to grow at a comparable pace to general app growth. Teledermatology apps experienced significant growth from 2014 to 2017. This growth has allowed time-efficient and cost-effective access to dermatologists, especially in rural areas. The growth of dermatology apps targeting patients allows for patient autonomy but also can result in access to inaccurate information regarding dermatology conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence and associated cost of treating Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is unsustainable, and focus is needed on self-management and prevention of hospital admissions. Telehealth monitoring of patients' vital signs allows clinicians to prioritise their workload and enables patients to take more responsibility for their health. This paper reports the results of a qualitative study embedded within a feasibility and pilot Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) of Telehealth-supported care within a community-based COPD supported-discharge service. The aim of the study was to qualitatively explore the experiences of patients with COPD who had received either a Telehealth-supported or a specialist nursing intervention following their discharge from hospital after an admission for a COPD exacerbation.
METHODS: Patients were invited to either participate in semi-structured interviews or to complete a semi-structured self-administered questionnaire on completion of the intervention. Nine patients were interviewed (67 \% female) and seventeen patients completed the questionnaires. In addition, three clinicians responsible for the delivery of both interventions were interviewed to obtain their perspectives on the new services.
RESULTS: Seven underlying themes emerged from the patient interviews and were further explored in the questionnaires: (1) patient demographics; (2) information received by the participants; (3) installation of the Telehealth technology; (4) Telehealth service functionality; (5) visits; (6) service withdrawal; and (7) service perceptions. Recipients of both services reported feelings of safety derived from the delivery of an integrated, community-based service.
CONCLUSIONS: Although recipients of the Telehealth service received 50 \% fewer home visits from the clinicians than recipients of a more traditional community-based nursing intervention, the patients were enthusiastic about the service, with some describing it as the best service they had ever received. This suggests that a Telehealth intervention is an acceptable alternative to a more traditional home nursing visit model for monitoring community-based patients with COPD following their discharge from hospital.

DESIGN: Three-arm cohort study.
SETTING: Homes of enrollees of a state-based healthcare plan for older adults.
PARTICIPANTS: Enrollees dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid (N = 268).
INTERVENTION: Health and safety passive remote patient monitoring (PRPM) systems were installed in enrollees' homes (the intervention group) with monitoring and proactive intervention of a case manager when deviation from baseline subject behavior was detected.
MEASUREMENTS: Claims data were collected over 12 months to assess healthcare use and costs in the intervention group and to compare use and costs with those of two control groups: a concurrent group of enrollees who declined the technology and a historical cohort matched on age to the participation group.
RESULTS: Although the small sample size precluded cost differences that were statistically significant, the participant group used substantially less custodial care, emergency department (ED) services, inpatient stays, and ED costs than the two control groups.
CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, the PRPM system was associated with apparent healthcare cost savings. Although more cost analyses are warranted, ambient assisted living technologies are a potentially valuable investment for older adult care.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To report the four-year experience of the Stanford University Network for Diagnosis of Retinopathy of Prematurity (SUNDROP) telemedicine initiative, which was developed to reduce the risk of blindness from retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the SUNDROP archival data between 12/1/2005 and 11/30/2009. A total of 410 consecutively enrolled infants meeting ROP screening criteria had nurse-obtained fundoscopic images evaluated remotely by an ROP specialist. Every infant then received at least one dilated bedside binocular indirect ophthalmoscope (BIO) examination within one week of discharge. All infants were then followed with both telemedicine images and bedside evaluation in clinic according to recommended screening timelines. Primary outcomes were treatment-warranted ROP (TW-ROP), defined as Early Treatment of ROP Type 1, and adverse anatomical outcomes.
RESULTS: The SUNDROP telemedicine screening initiative has not missed any TW-ROP in its four-year evaluation period. A total of 410 infants (820 eyes) were imaged, resulting in 1486 examinations and 18,097 unique images. An average of 12.2 images were obtained per patient. Fourteen infants met TW-ROP criteria on telemedicine examination. After bedside evaluation, 13 infants required laser photocoagulation and one was followed until he spontaneously regressed. Infants with TW-ROP had a significantly lower gestational age (24.9 weeks), birth weight (658.7 grams), and were more likely to be male than the no TW-ROP cohort (all p values {\textless}0.00001). Telemedicine had a calculated sensitivity of 100\%, specificity of 99.8\%, positive predicative value of 92.9\% and negative predictive value of 100\% for the detection of TW-ROP. No patient progressed to retinal detachment or any adverse anatomical outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: The SUNDROP initiative demonstrated a high degree of diagnostic reliability and was able to capture all infants with TW-ROP. Telemedicine offers a cost-effective, reliable and accurate screening methodology for identifying infants with TW-ROP without sacrificing quality of care.},

We explored the feasibility of a comprehensive, telemedicine-based OSA management pathway in a community-based Veteran cohort.
METHODS: This prospective, parallel-group randomized pilot study assessed feasibility of a telemedicine-based pathway for OSA evaluation and management in comparison to a more traditional, in-person care model. The study included 60 Veterans at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center and two affiliated community-based outpatient clinics. Telemedicine pathway feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes were assessed through a variety of quantitative (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, dropout rates, positive airway pressure [PAP] adherence rates, participant satisfaction ratings) and qualitative (verbal feedback) metrics.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in functional outcome changes, patient satisfaction, dropout rates, or objectively measured PAP adherence between groups after 3 months of treatment. Telemedicine participants showed greater improvement in mental health scores, and their feedback was overwhelmingly positive.
CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study suggests that telemedicine-based management of OSA patients is feasible in terms of patient functional outcomes and overall satisfaction with care. Future studies should include larger populations to further elucidate these findings while assessing provider- and patient-related cost effectiveness.},

OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze the potential benefits gained from the addition of dermoscopic images to an internet-based skin cancer screening system.
METHODS: A randomized clinical trial assessed the diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness of clinical teleconsultations (CTC) and clinical with dermoscopic teleconsultations.
RESULTS: A total of 454 patients were enrolled in the trial (nCTC = 226, nclinical with dermoscopic teleconsultation = 228). Teledermoscopy improved sensitivity and specificity (92.86\% and 96.24\%, respectively) compared with CTC (86.57\% and 72.33\%, respectively). Correct decisions were made in 94.30\% of patients through clinical with dermoscopic teleconsultations and in 79.20\% in CTC (P {\textless} .001). The only variable associated with an increased likelihood of correct diagnosis was management using teledermoscopy (odds ratio 4.04; 95\% confidence interval 2.02-8.09; P {\textless} .0001). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed teledermoscopy as the dominant strategy, with a lower cost-effectiveness ratio (65.13 vs 80.84).
LIMITATIONS: Potentially, a limitation is the establishment of an experienced dermatologist as the gold standard for the in-person evaluation.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a web system to attend the patients with CKD not on dialysis and clinically stable stages at distance.
METHODS: Developed a system using the Java language, MySQL database and PrimeFaces framework; available on a Glassfish application server.
RESULTS: The initial access is performed by the nephrologist, which registers the patients with their personal information and access data. After being registered, the patient (or family doctor) can enter the data of your query and these will be following, passed on to the nephrologist for evaluation. The form with the data of interest is pre-determined, but there is possibility to add free-form information. The system enables, in addition, there is exchange of messages between doctors and patients. In addition, users receive messages via e-mail alerting them of their duties. Confidentiality is guaranteed by individual passwords for doctors and patients.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although there have been significant advances in network, hardware, and software technologies, the health care environment has not taken advantage of these developments to solve many of its inherent problems. Research activities in these 3 areas make it possible to apply advanced technologies to address many of these issues such as real-time monitoring of a large number of patients, particularly where a timely response is critical.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to design and develop innovative technological solutions to offer a more proactive and reliable medical care environment. The short-term and primary goal was to construct IoT4Health, a flexible software framework to generate a range of Internet of things (IoT) applications, containing components such as multi-agent systems that are designed to perform Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) activities autonomously. An investigation into its full potential to conduct such patient monitoring activities in a more proactive way is an expected future step.
METHODS: A framework methodology was selected to evaluate whether the RPM domain had the potential to generate customized applications that could achieve the stated goal of being responsive and flexible within the RPM domain. As a proof of concept of the software framework's flexibility, 3 applications were developed with different implementations for each framework hot spot to demonstrate potential. Agents4Health was selected to illustrate the instantiation process and IoT4Health's operation. To develop more concrete indicators of the responsiveness of the simulated care environment, an experiment was conducted while Agents4Health was operating, to measure the number of delays incurred in monitoring the tasks performed by agents.
RESULTS: IoT4Health's construction can be highlighted as our contribution to the development of eHealth solutions. As a software framework, IoT4Health offers extensibility points for the generation of applications. Applications can extend the framework in the following ways: identification, collection, storage, recovery, visualization, monitoring, anomalies detection, resource notification, and dynamic reconfiguration. Based on other outcomes involving observation of the resulting applications, it was noted that its design contributed toward more proactive patient monitoring. Through these experimental systems, anomalies were detected in real time, with agents sending notifications instantly to the health providers.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the cost-benefit of the construction of a more generic and complex system instead of a custom-made software system demonstrated the worth of the approach, making it possible to generate applications in this domain in a more timely fashion.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The fields of mental health, child welfare, and juvenile justice are jointly faced with the challenge of reducing the prevalence of antisocial behavior among adolescents. In the last 20 years, conduct disorders have moved from being considered intractable difficulties to having complex but available solutions. The treatments for even long-standing offending behavior among adolescents are now well documented and supported by a growing and compelling body of evidence. These empirically validated interventions are being widely disseminated, but the replication of the results from clinical trials in community settings has yet to be documented. The treatments, which produced impressive effects in a research context, are difficult to replicate without intensive monitoring of fidelity by the developers. Such monitoring is a barrier toward adoption; as the distance between the adopter and developer increases, so does cost. At the same time, states, communities, and agencies are under increasing pressure to implement those intervention services that have been shown to be most effective. The use of the Internet offers a potential solution in that existing reporting and data collection by clinicians can be subject to remote supervision. Such a system would have the potential to provide dissemination teams with more direct access to higher-quality data and would make adopters more likely to be able to implement services at the highest possible conformity to research protocols.
OBJECTIVE: To create and test such an innovative system for use with the Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC) program, which is an in-home treatment (alternative to a residential- or group-home setting) for antisocial youths. This research could advance the knowledge base about developing innovative infrastructures in community settings to disseminate empirically validated treatments.
METHODS: The fidelity system was used and reviewed by parent and professional users: 20 foster parent users of the Parent Daily Report function, 9 professional MTFC program supervisors, and 4 MTFC consultants. All participants rated the system's ease of use, quality of the website, and observational videos recorded at agency meetings. In addition, foster parents entered data on child behavior.
RESULTS: All professionals and foster parents rated the system as very easy to use. We found particularly high levels of use by parents. Professionals rated the computer-collected videos of clinical meetings as being of high quality and easily codeable.
CONCLUSIONS: The project developed a user-friendly and secure Web-based system using state-of-the-art computer-based protocols for recording questionnaire and observational data generated by community-based MTFC staff and foster parents, with positive satisfaction and utilization results.},

Total healthcare costs were estimated over a 6-month period at individual patient level, from a healthcare sector perspective. The bootstrap method was used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. Telemonitoring costs were found to be €2039 less per patient compared to standard monitoring; however, this difference was not statistically significant.

We now routinely use IA for quantitative and qualitative analysis of theranostic markers such as human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2/neu), estrogen and progesterone receptors, and Ki-67. Quantitative IA requires extensive validation, however, and may not always be the best approach, with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors being one example in which a semiautomated approach may be preferable for patient care. We find that IA has great utility for objective assessment of gastrointestinal tract dysplasia, microvessel density in hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, renal fibrosis, and general quality analysis/quality control, although the applications of these to daily practice are still in development. Collaborations with bioinformatics specialists have explored novel applications to gliomas, including in silico approaches for mining histologic data and correlating with molecular and radiologic findings. We and many others are using WSI for rapid, remote-access slide reviews (telepathology), though technical factors currently limit its utility for routine, high-volume diagnostics. In our experience, the greatest current practical impact of WSI lies in facilitating long-term storage and retrieval of images while obviating the need to keep slides on site. Once the existing barriers of capital cost, validation, operator training, software design, and storage/back-up concerns are overcome, these technologies appear destined to be a cornerstone of precision medicine and personalized patient care, and to become a routine part of pathology practice.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The need for real time anatomic pathology services has grown as healthcare systems, traditionally found at large medical centers, expand into smaller communities. The placement of a pathologist is not cost-, time-, or resource-efficient. Telecytopathology can provide rapid offsite evaluation of cytology tissues. This study evaluated the accuracy rate of rendered preliminary assessments for telecytopathology of ultrasound (US)-guided fine-needle aspirations (FNAs) for an offsite facility by comparing preliminary assessment results with the final diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pathology database was searched for telecytopathology US-guided FNAs with rapid offsite evaluation performed at a regional care center from August 2014 to June 2016. A total of 674 consecutive US-guided FNAs from 444 patients were obtained. FNA sites included lymph node (345 cases), breast (178 cases), thyroid gland (71 cases), and others (80 cases).
RESULTS: Preliminary assessments of the 674 FNAs were adequate/benign in 275 (41\%) cases, adequate/malignant in 182 (27\%) cases, adequate/further review needed in 162 (24\%) cases, indeterminate/borderline cellularity in 37 (5\%) cases, and nondiagnostic in 18 (3\%) cases. Final FNA diagnoses rendered included 391 (58\%) negative for malignancy, 205 (30\%) malignant, 34 (5\%) atypical/suspicious for malignancy, 26 (4\%) indeterminate cellularity-favor benign, and 18 (3\%) nondiagnostic specimens. Concurrent core biopsy was performed in 42 cases and 83 cases were triaged for ancillary studies. The majority (99\%) of US-guided FNAs demonstrated concordant preliminary assessments with the final diagnoses. A major discrepancy occurred in 1 case; 5 cases had minor discrepancies.
CONCLUSIONS: Remote facility telecytopathology can be utilized as an accurate modality in guiding appropriate tissue acquisition and final diagnosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Continuity of care is widely regarded as an important marker of quality in the management of patients with long-term  conditions. New services that integrate telemonitoring into care pathways have potential to change aspects of continuity in both positive  and negative ways.
AIMS: A telemonitoring service for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was introduced in Lothian, Scotland, in  2009. A qualitative study, nested within the TELESCOT COPD randomised control trial, was undertaken to explore the views of patients  and professionals on telemonitoring. The perceived impact of telemonitoring on continuity of care was investigated as part of the  research.
METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 38 patients (47\% male, mean age 67.5 years). A maximum variation sample  in relation to age, sex, socio-economic background, disease severity, and compliance with telemonitoring was recruited. Thirty-two  stakeholders (healthcare professionals and managers) were interviewed. Transcribed coded data were analysed thematically using the  framework approach. Interpretation was supported by multidisciplinary discussion.
RESULTS: Patients and healthcare professionals considered that relationship-based continuity of care was important in the delivery of  telemonitoring services. Managers placed emphasis on improved continuity of clinical management as a means of reducing healthcare costs.  However, professionals described many operational challenges arising from the 'bolting-on' of telemonitoring provision to existing usual care  provision which, they considered, resulted in the proliferation of additional managerial discontinuities.
CONCLUSIONS: Managers and healthcare professionals face major challenges in meeting demands for both relationship continuity and continuity  of clinical management in the development of telemonitoring services.},

In 2011, the Telescot research team commenced work on a feasibility trial to investigate home telemonitoring of blood pressure for people who have experienced stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The team decided to involve patients in the development of the research.
OBJECTIVES: To improve research design through patient involvement.
METHOD OF PATIENT INVOLVEMENT: A modified form of the 'Scrutiny Panel' approach was used to involve people who had stroke in the research project.
RESULTS: The Patient Panel supported the research in three key ways: it informed patient communication; it presented patient perspectives on the applicability and usability of the intervention; and it guided the development of the qualitative study.
DISCUSSION: The initiative was considered a positive experience for all. However, challenges were identified in terms of the time and cost implications of undertaking patient involvement.
IMPLICATION FOR RESEARCH PRACTICE: Importance is attached to adequate project planning and development, partnership working with community-based organizations and the necessity for clear role delineation between patients and professionals to enable effective collaborative working.
CONCLUSIONS: The Telescot Patient Panel was beneficial in supporting the development of the feasibility trial. The Panel approach was considered transferable to other clinical research contexts.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite various applications of tele-ICU, there are still many questions about its costs and advantages in ICU. Some of its advantages are accelerating consultations and bringing physicians' satisfaction from tele-consultation outcomes. The aim of this study is to discuss these advantages.
Materials and Methods: Initially a telemedicine network was implemented and in the case of having no related specialist, the physicians used telemedicine network to perform specialized tele-consultation to thoracic surgery ICU patients. ICU patient's documents during a year before tele-consultation were studied and delay time in consultation was recorded and compared between the two phases. Finally, the physicians' satisfaction with tele-consultation was evaluated.
Results: Fifty-eight tele-consultations in various medical fields were carried out, of which 27 were neurology cases. From the time of receiving a consultation request to its performance, the mean time was 1.3 days in tele-consultation. Tele-consultations were given 2.5 times faster than face to face method. In evaluation of physicians' satisfaction, 82.75\% of them were fully satisfied from tele-consultation, 12.06\% were partly satisfied and 5.17\% were not satisfied.
Conclusion: Since the length of hospitalization in ICU is crucial due to heavy costs of treatment, high risk of contamination and limited beds, performing timely consultation is a key factor in reducing hospitalization period. Tele-consultation in thoracic surgery ICU not only accelerates patient care, but also results in higher physician satisfaction.},

Even though these ventilation modes have become more responsive to patient efforts, adversely they might lead to events such as false triggering, autotriggering, delayed triggering.In addition, manufacturers are developing tools to enhance the follow-up, remotely or offline, of the treatment by using embedded memory in the respiratory devices. This logging might be beneficial for the caregiver to review and document the treatment and tune the settings to the patient's need and comfort.

	abstract = {With the availability of oral care services very unevenly distributed in rural or remote areas, underserved people seek oral care from non-dental care providers. Against this backdrop, and coupled with the decreasing cost of and innovations in technology, there is a growing interest in the adoption of telemedicine services. Regardless of the lack of good-quality evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine, evidence already indicates that telemedicine, even with extra costs, helps in reducing the inequalities in the provision of primary health care. Telemedicine has the potential to overcome geographical barriers and contribute to closing the rural-urban healthcare gap in Australia and many other regions. Although research examining different teledentistry applications has found that this technology can be successfully integrated into different settings, there is little active teledentistry practice in Australia. The integration of telemedicine into the mainstream oral health system is a complex and collaborative process in which numerous factors at individual, infrastructure and organisational levels are involved. Addressing the barriers that delay the implementation of a teledentistry service can provide valuable insights into its lack of acceptance and establish an evidence base that can help to inform future decisions about the benefits of teledentistry.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the scale of resource transfer that could be achieved by screening low-risk schoolchildren using teledentistry rather than using traditional visual dental examination.
METHODS: This study was based on a previous cost-minimisation study that compared the costs of two dental-screening approaches (visual and teledentistry). The data for the population of children 5-14 years of age was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and was divided across Australia according to statistical local area (SA2). The cost models (for teledentistry and visual screening) for each SA2 relative to the state, Remoteness Area (RA) and Socio-Economic Index for Area (SEIFA) indexes were estimated. The geographical information system was used to superimpose modelled cost data on the geographical map to provide a visual presentation of the data. Resource transfer scenarios, based on risk minimisation, were then developed and analysed.
RESULTS: This study demonstrated a suboptimal allocation of dental-care resources, such that children living in high socio-economic areas (major cities) with low disease burdens consuming half of the estimated resources of a universal visual dental screening system. The findings suggest that utilising teledentistry screening for low-risk children has the potential to free up \$40 million per annum. Such resources can be reallocated to increase care access and improve the quality of dental services for vulnerable children.
CONCLUSION: To reduce inequalities in dental health within a community, scarce health-care resources should be targeted at the population at most risk. These findings can be used to inform policymakers, guide the appropriate distribution of scarce resources and target dental services to benefit high-need children.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Stroke is a time-critical medical emergency requiring specialized treatment. Prehospital delay contributes significantly to delayed or missed treatment opportunities. In-ambulance telemedicine can bring stroke expertise to the prehospital arena and facilitate this complex diagnostic and therapeutic process.
AIMS: This study evaluates the efficacy, safety, feasibility, reliability and cost-effectiveness of in-ambulance telemedicine for patients with suspicion of acute stroke. We hypothesize that this approach will reduce the delay to in-hospital treatment by streamlining the diagnostic process and that prehospital stroke care will be improved by expert stroke support via telemedicine during the ambulance transportation.
DESIGN: PreSSUB II is an interventional, prospective, randomized, open-blinded, end-point, single-center trial comparing standard emergency care by the Paramedic Intervention Team of the Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel (control) with standard emergency care complemented with in-ambulance teleconsultation service by stroke experts (PreSSUB).
STUDY OUTCOMES: The primary efficacy endpoint is the call-to-brain imaging time. Secondary endpoints for the efficacy analysis include the prevalence of medical events diagnosed and corrected during in-ambulance teleconsultation, the proportion of patients with ischemic stroke receiving recanalization therapy, the assessment of disability, functional status, quality of life and overall well-being. Mortality at 90 days after stroke is the primary safety endpoint. Secondary safety analysis will involve the registration of any adverse event. Other analyses include assessment of feasibility and reliability and a health economic evaluation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the impact of an Internet-based telematic system on the economic and clinical management of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 6-month prospective, randomized, comparative, open, multicenter study included patients with type 1 diabetes {\textgreater}18 years old treated with multiple insulin doses and with a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of {\textgreater}8\%. We compared an intervention group (IG) (two face-to-face and five telematic appointments) with a control group (CG) (seven face-to-face appointments). The variables studied were (1) patient and healthcare team costs, (2) metabolic control, (3) knowledge of diabetes, (4) quality of life, and (5) self-care treatment adherence.
RESULTS: Of the 154 patients included, 118 (76.6\%) completed the study (IG, 54; CG, 64). The time used by the CG to follow the program was 823±645 min versus 353±222 min in the IG (P{\textless}0.0001). Compared with the CG, the IG required less healthcare time from the professionals (288±105 min vs. 232±89 min; P{\textless}0.001). HbA1c improved in both groups (IG, 9.2±1.5\% [77.0±17.0 mmol/mol] vs. 8.7±1.5\% [71.6±17.0 mmol/mol] [P{\textless}0.001]; CG, 9.2±0.9\% [77.0±10.0 mmol/mol] vs. 8.6±0.9\% [70.5±10.0 mmol/mol] [P{\textless}0.001], as did knowledge and self-care treatment adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of interactive telematic appointments in subjects with type 1 diabetes and inadequate metabolic control is an efficient strategy, providing results comparable to those of face-to-face appointments in relation to improvement in glycemic control, knowledge acquisition, and self-care treatment adherence, with a significant reduction in the time used, especially by patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking in pregnancy is a major public health concern. Pregnant smokers are particularly difficult to reach, with low uptake of support options and few effective interventions. Text message-based self-help is a promising, low-cost intervention for this population, but its real-world uptake is largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the uptake and cost-effectiveness of a tailored, theory-guided, text message intervention for pregnant smokers ("MiQuit") when advertised on the internet.
METHODS: Links to a website providing MiQuit initiation information (texting a short code) were advertised on a cost-per-click basis on 2 websites (Google Search and Facebook; £1000 budget each) and free of charge within smoking-in-pregnancy webpages on 2 noncommercial websites (National Childbirth Trust and NHS Choices). Daily budgets were capped to allow the Google and Facebook adverts to run for 1 and 3 months, respectively. We recorded the number of times adverts were shown and clicked on, the number of MiQuit initiations, the characteristics of those initiating MiQuit, and whether support was discontinued prematurely. For the commercial adverts, we calculated the cost per initiation and, using quit rates obtained from an earlier clinical trial, estimated the cost per additional quitter.
RESULTS: With equal capped budgets, there were 812 and 1889 advert clicks to the MiQuit website from Google (search-based) and Facebook (banner) adverts, respectively. MiQuit was initiated by 5.2\% (42/812) of those clicking via Google (95\% CI 3.9\%-6.9\%) and 2.22\% (42/1889) of those clicking via Facebook (95\% CI 1.65\%-2.99\%). Adverts on noncommercial webpages generated 53 clicks over 6 months, with 9 initiations (9/53, 17\%; 95\% CI 9\%-30\%). For the commercial websites combined, mean cost per initiation was £24.73; estimated cost per additional quitter, including text delivery costs, was £735.86 (95\% CI £227.66-£5223.93). Those initiating MiQuit via Google were typically very early in pregnancy (median gestation 5 weeks, interquartile range 10 weeks); those initiating via Facebook were distributed more evenly across pregnancy (median gestation 16 weeks, interquartile range 14 weeks).
CONCLUSIONS: Commercial online adverts are a feasible, likely cost-effective method for engaging pregnant smokers in digital cessation support and may generate uptake at a faster rate than noncommercial websites. As a strategy for implementing MiQuit, online advertising has large reach potential and can offer support to a hard-to-reach population of smokers.},

PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six purposively selected informants completed semi-structured interviews and 24 individuals with expertise in the relevant clinical and informatics domains from academia, industry, policy and provider organizations and participated in a multi-path mapping workshop.
RESULTS: The evidence base for the effectiveness of telemonitoring is weak and inconsistent, with insufficient cost-effectiveness studies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telehealth services are promoted to reduce the cost of travel for people living in rural areas. The previous Australian Government, through the national Digital Economy Strategy, invested heavily in telehealth service development, at the same time introducing a carbon pricing mechanism. In planning a range of new telehealth services to a rural community the authors sought to quantify the travel conducted by people from one rural area in Australia to access health care, and to calculate the associated carbon emissions.
METHODS: A population survey was conducted over a 1-week period of health-related travel events for the year 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 of all households on King Island, a community situated between the Australian mainland state of Victoria and the state of Tasmania. Validated emissions calculators were sourced from the Carbon Neutral website, including the vehicle and fuel use calculator and air travel carbon calculator, to calculate the total emissions associated with the fuel burned in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e).
RESULTS: Thirty nine percent of the population (625 participants) reported a total of 511 healthcare-related travel events. Participants travelled a total of 346 573 km and generated 0.22 tCO2e per capita. Participants paid the cost of their own travel more than 70\% of the time.
CONCLUSIONS: Dependence on fossil fuels for transport in a carbon economy has a significant impact on total healthcare carbon emissions. Alternative models of care, such as telehealth, need be developed for an environmentally sustainable healthcare system for rural and remote areas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several models suggest how the qualities of a product or service influence user satisfaction. Models such as the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Delone and McLean Information Systems Success demonstrate those relations and have been used in the context of health information systems.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate which qualities foster greater satisfaction among patient and professional users. In addition, we are interested in knowing to what extent improvement in those qualities can explain user satisfaction and whether this makes user satisfaction a proxy indicator of those qualities.
METHODS: The Unified eValuation using ONtology (UVON) method was used to construct an ontology of the required qualities for 7 electronic health (eHealth) apps being developed in the Future Internet Social and Technological Alignment Research (FI-STAR) project, a European Union (EU) project in electronic health (eHealth). The eHealth apps were deployed across 7 EU countries. The ontology included and unified the required qualities of those systems together with the aspects suggested by the Model for ASsessment of Telemedicine apps (MAST) evaluation framework. Moreover, 2 similar questionnaires for 87 patient users and 31 health professional users were elicited from the ontology. In the questionnaires, the user was asked if the system has improved the specified qualities and if the user was satisfied with the system. The results were analyzed using Kendall correlation coefficients matrices, incorporating the quality and satisfaction aspects. For the next step, 2 partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) path models were developed using the quality and satisfaction measure variables and the latent construct variables that were suggested by the UVON method.
RESULTS: Most of the quality aspects grouped by the UVON method are highly correlated. Strong correlations in each group suggest that the grouped qualities can be measures that reflect a latent quality construct. The PLS-SEM path analysis for the patients reveals that the effectiveness, safety, and efficiency of treatment provided by the system are the most influential qualities in achieving and predicting user satisfaction. For the professional users, effectiveness and affordability are the most influential. The parameters of the PLS-SEM that are calculated allow for the measurement of a user satisfaction index similar to CSI for similar health information systems.
CONCLUSIONS: For both patients and professionals, the effectiveness of systems highly contributes to their satisfaction. Patients care about improvements in safety and efficiency, whereas professionals care about improvements in the affordability of treatments with health information systems. User satisfaction is reflected more in the users' evaluation of system output and fulfillment of expectations but slightly less in how far the system is from ideal. Investigating satisfaction scores can be a simple and fast way to infer if the system has improved the abovementioned qualities in treatment and care.},

We present a study examining the feasibility and outcomes of implementation of a telephone follow-up program for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.
METHODS: This is a retrospective review of consecutive patients who prospectively agreed to undergo telephone follow-up after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair instead of standard face-to-face clinic visits. Patients received a telephone call from a dedicated physician assistant 2 to 3 weeks after surgery and answered a predetermined questionnaire. A face-to-face clinic visit was scheduled based on the results of the call or on patient request.
RESULTS: Of 62 patients who underwent surgery, all agreed to telephone follow-up instead of face-to-face clinic visits. Their mean round-trip distance to the hospital was 122 miles. Fifty-five patients (88.7\%) successfully completed planned telephone follow-up. Three patients (4.8\%) were lost to follow-up, and 4 (6.5\%) were erroneously scheduled for a clinic appointment. Of the 55 patients who were reached by telephone, 50 (90.9\%) were satisfied and declined an in-person clinic visit. Five patients (9.1\%) returned for a clinic appointment based on concerns raised during the telephone call. Of these, 1 was found to have an early hernia recurrence and 1 had a seroma.
CONCLUSION: Telephone follow-up by a midlevel provider after laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is feasible and effective and is well received by patients.},

OBJECTIVE: To update the trends and current workforce issues for the field of dermatology.
METHODS: The AAD Practice Profile Survey is sent by both e-mail and postal mail to a random sample of practicing dermatologists who are AAD members.
RESULTS: Shifts are noted in the primary practice setting; fewer dermatologists are in solo practice and more are in group practices than in previous years. Teledermatology use trended upward from 7\% to 11\% between 2012 and 2014. The implementation of electronic health records increased from 51\% in 2011 to 70\% in 2014.
LIMITATIONS: There is potential for response bias and inaccurate self-reporting. Survey responses collected may not be representative of all geographic areas.
CONCLUSION: The demand for dermatology services remains strong. Shifts in the practice setting may be related to increases in overhead costs that are partially associated with the implementation of technology-based medical records. Integration of electronic health records and utilization of telemedicine are increasing.},

	abstract = {AIM: The purpose of this analysis was to assess the budgetary impact and cost effectiveness of the national use of thrombolysis with alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; rt-PA) for acute ischaemic stroke via telemedicine in Denmark.
METHODS: Computations were based on a Danish health economic model of thrombolysis treatment of acute ischaemic stroke via telemedicine. Cost data for stroke units and satellite clinics were taken from the first practical experiences in Denmark with implementing thrombolysis via telemedical linkage to the Stroke Department at Aarhus University Hospital. Effectiveness data were taken from a published pooled analysis of results from randomized controlled trials of alteplase.
RESULTS: The calculations showed that the additional total costs to the hospitals of implementing thrombolysis with alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke via telemedicine were approximately \$US3.0 (range 2.0-5.8) million per year in the case of five centres and five satellite clinics, or \$US3.6 (range 2.4-7.0) million per year based on seven centres and seven satellite clinics. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated to be approximately \$US50,000 when taking a short time perspective (1 year), but thrombolysis was dominant (both cheaper and more effective) after as little as 2 years and cost effectiveness improved over longer time scales.
CONCLUSION: The budgetary impact of using thrombolysis with alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke via telemedicine depends on the existing capacity and organizational conditions at the local hospitals. The health economic model computations suggest that the macroeconomic costs may balance with savings in care and rehabilitation after as little as 2 years, and that potentially large long-term savings are associated with thrombolysis with alteplase delivered by telemedicine, although the long-term calculations are uncertain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older adults who live in rural areas experience significant disparities in health status and access to mental health care. "Telepsychology," (also referred to as "telepsychiatry," or "telemental health") represents a potential strategy towards addressing this longstanding problem. Older adults may benefit from telepsychology due to its: (1) utility to address existing problematic access to care for rural residents; (2) capacity to reduce stigma associated with traditional mental health care; and (3) utility to overcome significant age-related problems in ambulation and transportation. Moreover, preliminary evidence indicates that telepsychiatry programs are often less expensive for patients, and reduce travel time, travel costs, and time off from work. Thus, telepsychology may provide a cost-efficient solution to access-to-care problems in rural areas.
METHODS: We describe an ongoing four-year prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of an empirically supported treatment for major depressive disorder, Behavioral Activation, delivered either via in-home videoconferencing technology ("Telepsychology") or traditional face-to-face services ("Same-Room"). Our hypothesis is that in-homeTelepsychology service delivery will be equally effective as the traditional mode (Same-Room). Two-hundred twenty-four (224) male and female elderly participants will be administered protocol-driven individual Behavioral Activation therapy for depression over an 8-week period; and subjects will be followed for 12-months to ascertain longer-term effects of the treatment on three outcomes domains: (1) clinical outcomes (symptom severity, social functioning); (2) process variables (patient satisfaction, treatment credibility, attendance, adherence, dropout); and (3) economic outcomes (cost and resource use).
DISCUSSION: Results from the proposed study will provide important insight into whether telepsychology service delivery is as effective as the traditional mode of service delivery, defined in terms of clinical, process, and economic outcomes, for elderly patients with depression residing in rural areas without adequate access to mental health services.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little evidence exists regarding the costs of telemedicine, especially considering changes over time. This analysis aimed to analyze trajectory of healthcare cost before, during, and after a behavioral activation intervention delivered via telepsychology and same-room delivery to elderly Veterans with depression.
METHODS: 241 participants were randomly assigned into one of two study groups: behavioral activation for depression via telemedicine or via same-room treatment. Patients received 8 weeks of weekly 60-min individual sessions of behavioral activation for depression. Primary outcomes were collected at 12-months. Inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and total costs were collected from VA Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) datasets for FY 1998-2014 and compared between the two treatment groups. Generalized mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories over time.
RESULTS: Overall cost, as well as, outpatient and pharmacy cost show increasing trend over time. Unadjusted and adjusted trajectories over time for any cost were not different between the two treatment groups. There was a significant overall increasing trend over time for outpatient (p{\textless}0.001) and total cost (p{\textless}0.001) but not for inpatient (p=0.543) or pharmacy cost (p=0.084).
LIMITATIONS: Generalizability to younger, healthier populations may be limited due to inclusion criteria for study participants.
CONCLUSION: Healthcare costs before, during, and after intervention did not differ between the telemedicine and in-person delivery methods. Outpatient costs accounted for most of the increasing trend of cost over time. These results support policies to use both telehealth and in-person treatment modalities to effectively and efficiently provide high quality care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examined whether delivering behavioral activation for depression through telehealth is cost-effective compared to in-person care.
METHODS: This was a randomized, noninferiority trial, with participants assigned to 1 of 2 arms of 8-week behavioral activation therapy: in-person or via telehealth. Primary clinical outcomes included measures of depression (Geriatric Depression Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) at 12 months follow-up. Quality of life was assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Economic outcomes included the difference in health services utilization costs between 1 year post-intervention and 1 year pre-intervention, as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for differences in cost based on mean travel and median travel relative to the 3 primary outcomes and QALYs.
RESULTS: 241 participants were enrolled and completed study procedures between April 2007 and July 2012. Post-intervention, veterans treated in-person had a mean of \$2,998 higher VA health care utilization costs relative to their pre-intervention utilization costs, while veterans treated via telehealth had a mean of \$870.91 higher costs post-intervention relative to pre-intervention. The difference between bootstrap mean and median QALYs was not significantly different from zero.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the intervention costs for telehealth were higher relative to in-person care, veterans receiving behavioral activation via telehealth had lower health utilization costs 1 year after the intervention than those receiving care in person while QALYs were approximately the same. These results demonstrate the noninferiority of telehealth in treating depression in veterans with respect to QALYs and a large and significant cost benefit of using telehealth in terms of health services utilization post-intervention.

We undertook this survey to explore the business models being used at other established telehealth centers.

METHODS: In this study, we compared the business models of 10 successful telehealth centers. We conducted the study by interviewing key individuals at the centers, either through teleconference or telephone.
RESULTS: We found that there are five general approaches to sustaining a telehealth center: grants, telehealth network membership fees, income from providing clinical services, per encounter charges, and operating as a cost center. We also found that most centers use more than one approach.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that, although the first four approaches can contribute to the success of a center, telehealth centers are and should remain cost centers for their respective institutions.},

Thousands of studies and hundreds of systematic reviews have been done, but their variability leaves many questions about telehealth's effectiveness, implementation priorities, and return on investment.
OBJECTIVES: There is an urgent need for a systematic, policy-relevant framework to integrate regulatory, operational, and clinical factors and to guide future investments in telehealth research and practice.
METHODS: An invited multidisciplinary group of 21 experts from AcademyHealth, the American Telemedicine Association (ATA), Kaiser Permanente Institute for Health Policy (KP), and the Physician Insurers Association of America (PIAA) met to review and discuss the components of a draft framework for policy-relevant telehealth research. The framework was revised and presented in a challenge workshop at Concordium 2016, and some additional refinements were made. The current framework encompasses the regulatory and payment policy context for telehealth, delivery system factors, and outcomes of telehealth interventions.
FINDINGS: Based on the feedback at Concordium 2016, the framework seems to have potential to help educate policymakers, payers, and health systems about the value of telehealth and to frame discussions about implementation barriers, including risk management concerns, technology costs, and organizational culture. However, questions remain about how to disseminate and use the framework to help coordinate policy, research, and implementation efforts in the delivery system.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate dermatology healthcare providers' communication via both modalities with regard to content and style.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In-person and teledermatology patient visits were observed, audio-recorded, and transcribed over an 8-month period. A content analysis was performed.
RESULTS: The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the content differences between visit modalities for each category. A p value of 0.05 was considered as significant for all tests. There were no statistically significant differences between modalities in the average number of physician words in seven of eight communication categories: small talk, clinical assessment, psychosocial issues, patient education, patient compliance, patient treatment, and administrative issues (p value range, 0.16-0.91). As well, the same communication themes occurred in each modality to essentially the same degree. For instance, assessment and discussion of treatment occurred in 100\% of in-person and teledermatology visits, as did small talk.
CONCLUSIONS: This research indicates that physician providers communicate with similar style and content whether using teledermatology or in-person.},

The purpose of this study was to describe the access to low-cost consumer technologies and willingness to use them to receive rehabilitation services among stroke survivors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were included in this survey study if they had a stroke, lived in the community, were 19 years of age or older, and able to understand English. Participants completed a study-specific telerehabilitation survey via phone call, mail, in-person, or online. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and survey responses.
RESULTS: One hundred two survey responses were returned, representing a 79.1\% response rate. The mean age of this urban (67.3\%) and rural (32.7\%) sample was 67.6 years. The technologies most commonly owned were as follows: televisions (91\%), landline telephones (88.0\%), and computers (79.0\%). A large proportion of the sample reported an interest to receive assessments (58.4\%), training and exercise programs (64.0\%), and education (61.4\%) via telerehabilitation, however, many were not interested to receive telerehabilitation (∼39\%) and believed that the quality of care would be less than in-person rehabilitation (71.0\%).
CONCLUSIONS: The use of consumer technologies for the delivery of rehabilitation services is both feasible and desirable by stroke survivors. Telerehabilitation services at present should augment and not replace in-person rehabilitation. However, in cases where in-person rehabilitation is neither accessible nor possible, telerehabilitation could serve as an acceptable alternative and is a key area for future research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of digital communication media is becoming increasingly important, with the primary aim of improving both treatment quality and patients' quality of life. In an effort to optimize telemedicine in the field of dermatology, we conducted a survey among dermatologists in Austria.
METHODS: Statistical analysis of a questionnaire that was developed by a working group and sent to 769 Austrian dermatologists.
RESULTS: Overall, 243 dermatologists (132 women/111 men) participated in the survey. Forty-seven percent of male respondents and 55 \% of female respondents had already received requests for teledermatology consultations. Seventy-three percent felt that telemedicine was able to contribute to relieving the economic burden on the health care system. Telecommunication between dermatologists and experts (in a given field of dermatology) was deemed to be particularly useful. While telemedicine was also considered to be appropriate for patient follow-up, it was viewed to be less useful for initial consultations. Roughly 50 \% of respondents used telemedicine to get a second opinion; one-third used it for initial consultations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our survey shows that the majority of participants consider teledermatology to be a useful supplement to the current practice of dermatology. Given its particular usefulness for triage purposes, teledermatology can help reduce the number of trips to the hospital and subsequent waiting times. This in turn leads to cost reduction and saves time for both patients and doctors. Legal regulations that include provisions for appropriate reimbursement of physicians would make using teledermatology more attractive.},

Telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and improve patients' quality of care in communities where access to pain specialists has previously been unavailable. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a telehealth intervention (TelePain) designed to address the need for pain specialist consultation regarding pain and symptom management issues in non-academic medical centers. We describe the theoretical foundation and development of a multifaceted intervention using a cluster randomized clinical trial design. Health care providers and their patients with chronic pain are enrolled in the study. Patient participants receive the intervention (report of symptoms and receipt of a pain graph) weekly for 8 weeks and are contacted at 12 weeks for completion of post-intervention follow-up measures. Their providers attend TelePain sessions which involve a didactic presentation on an evidence-based topic related to pain management followed by patient case presentations and discussion by community clinicians. Symptom management recommendations for each patient case are made by a panel of pain specialists representing internal medicine, addiction medicine, rehabilitation medicine, anesthesiology, psychiatry, and nursing. The outcomes assessed in this randomized trial focus on pain intensity, pain's interference on function and sleep, and anxiety, depression, and cost-effectiveness. Some of the challenges and lessons that we have learned early in implementing the TelePain intervention are also reported.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abortion rates in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) are nearly triple those in Western Europe, due to less use of contraception and highly restrictive abortion laws. Women resort to clandestine and often unsafe methods to end unwanted pregnancies, exposing themselves to the risk of complications and mortality. Medical abortion (MA) presents a safer alternative.
OBJECTIVES: To present evidence of MA's contributions to reduced complications, describe strategies to enhance safe MA, and highlight existing barriers to access in LAC, while examining MA's role in newly legal abortion services.
RESULTS: Substantial declines in abortion-related morbidity and mortality and lower costs of treating complications are observed in LAC with MA than with other self-induction methods. Telephone hotlines, telemedicine and harm reduction models enhance access to safer abortion and help reduce complication rates by facilitating information on MA's proper use. Misoprostol is registered in most LAC countries, but access is increasingly limited by regulations and cost.
CONCLUSION: Despite highly restrictive abortion laws in LAC, MA increases access to safer abortion. Yet, significant barriers remain and much more must be done to enhance use of modern contraceptive and safer abortion methods among women in the region.},

	abstract = {Standardization of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) care through participation in the ImproveCareNow (ICN) Network has improved outcomes for pediatric patients with IBD, but under the current care model, our improvements have plateaued. Current ICN model care guidelines recommend health supervision visits every six months. We identified a gap in our practice's ability to ensure either a routine six month follow-up or a rapid follow-up after a disease flare, and a significant number of patients with active disease status during a six month period lacked timely reassessment after interventions or medication changes. Telemedicine provides an alternative method of care delivery to address these gaps, but has had limited use in patients with IBD. A multi-step approach to offer alternative follow-up care options via telemedicine was developed with potential impact on remission rates and quality of life. Short term goals of the pilot were to improve telemedicine access for patients with IBD were to 1) increase the percent of patients with active disease with a follow-up completed within two months of a visit from 40\% to 70\%, 2) increase the percent of patients with a visit scheduled within two months of their last sick visit from 20\% to 70\% (interim measure), 3) increase the number of eVisits from zero visits per month to two visits per month during pilot phase, 4) increase electronic communication with patients from zero messages per month to 200 messages per month, 5) no change in complications or adverse events (defined as an unplanned visit or ED (emergency department) encounter within 30 days of an eVisit. The expected outcomes of the e-visit model were to: maintain baseline care standards and health screening capabilities, improve access to care, and provide equivalent care delivery (no increase in the number of unplanned clinical encounters). Using the IHI model for improvement (Plan-Do-Study-Act) we have seen a progressive increase in the rate of patient signups for the electronic medical record patient portal, with a baseline median of 20\% per clinic compared with a current median of approximately 70\% after six months. We successfully implemented e-messaging in its pilot form among five providers and have seen steady uptake in patient use from 5 patient initiated messages during the first month to 76 messages/month over the past three months. E-visits have replaced a total of 32 visits to date. Medications, nutrition, and disease activity were appropriately screened and managed electronically without the need for a physical office visit by the treating gastroenterologist. Access to care was improved in that all patients completed their e-visits from their homes without missing school or work and did not require a physical office visit. One visit successfully identified worsening of the patient's clinical course and resulted in a scheduled office visit request, but no unplanned office visits or ED visits have occurred. This report represents the first description of telemedicine use in routine clinical care in children with IBD. We anticipate continuing use of this novel mode of health care delivery in pediatrics in an effort to increase the proportion of patients seen for interval follow-up, after IBD diagnosis, or mild flare in an effort to target early treatment changes that should result in improved remission and patient reported outcomes. E-visits are less expensive and time consuming than traditional visits and may serve as an additional method of cost savings by matching care to a patient's individual needs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: India's economic growth rate in recent years has been fairly impressive. But, it has been consistently failing to make considerable progress in achieving health related Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets. Lack of coherence between provisions and utilization becomes the face of the problem. Inadequacies in outreach, access and affordability coupled with escalating healthcare costs have aggravated the problem. Here the application of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model seems to have enormous potential to ease the impasse.
METHODS: This paper tries to find the gap between the provisions and access in healthcare. The paper attempts to construct a Health Infrastructure Index (HII) and Health Attainment Index (HAI) for different states of India. Considering the presence of regional variations found in health infrastructure and attainment among the states, two states, viz. Maharashtra (MAH) and West Bengal (WB) have been chosen. Then contributions of health programs like Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), National Rural Telemedicine Network (NRTN) and Fair Price Shops (FPS), all PPP initiatives, have been assessed for both the states by carrying out comprehensive benefit-cost analysis.
RESULTS: The health infrastructure for population per unit area captures the outreach/delivery issue and the health attainment reveals the true scenario about how far the infrastructure has been accessed by the people; and the gap between the two, as the paper finds, is the root of the problem. The combined effect of RSBY and NRTN will leave both MAH and WB higher benefits in terms of health attainment. The contributions of RSBY and NRTN have been assessed for both the states by carrying out comprehensive benefit-cost analysis. FPS comes up with immense benefits for WB. It is yet to be implemented in MAH.
CONCLUSION: The outreach and access problems arising from deficiencies in infrastructure, human resources and financial ability are expected to be well-addressed by the spread of RSBY and NRTN jointly. The FPS mechanism under PPP initiative can be an effective tool in solving affordability problem by reducing the cost of treatment.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate travel-related and environmental savings resulting from the use of telemedicine for outpatient specialty consultations with a university telemedicine program.
METHODS: The study was designed to retrospectively analyze the telemedicine consultation database at the University of California Davis Health System (UCDHS) between July 1996 and December 2013. Travel distances and travel times were calculated between the patient home, the telemedicine clinic, and the UCDHS in-person clinic. Travel cost savings and environmental impact were calculated by determining differences in mileage reimbursement rate and emissions between those incurred in attending telemedicine appointments and those that would have been incurred if a visit to the hub site had been necessary.
RESULTS: There were 19,246 consultations identified among 11,281 unique patients. Telemedicine visits resulted in a total travel distance savings of 5,345,602 miles, a total travel time savings of 4,708,891 minutes or 8.96 years, and a total direct travel cost savings of \$2,882,056. The mean per-consultation round-trip distance savings were 278 miles, average travel time savings were 245 minutes, and average cost savings were \$156. Telemedicine consultations resulted in a total emissions savings of 1969 metric tons of CO2, 50 metric tons of CO, 3.7 metric tons of NOx, and 5.5 metric tons of volatile organic compounds.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the positive impact of a health system's outpatient telemedicine program on patient travel time, patient travel costs, and environmental pollutants.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Only preliminary reports have evaluated the impact of telemedicine in trauma care. This study will analyze outcomes before (pre-TM) and after (post-TM) implementation of telemedicine in the management of rural trauma patients initially treated at local community hospitals (LCH) before trauma center (TC) transfer.
METHODS: Seven rural hospital emergency departments in Mississippi were equipped with dual video cameras with remote control capability. All trauma patients initially treated at these LCH with TC consultation were reviewed. Data included patient demographics, Injury Severity Score, institutional volume of patients, mode of transportation, length of stay in LCH, transfer time (TT), mortality, and hospital cost. Patients were grouped in the pre-TM and post-TM periods. Statistical testing was with two-sample Student's t test or chi analysis as appropriate.
RESULTS: During 5 years, 814 traumatically injured patients (pre-TM, n = 351; post-TM, n = 463) presented to the LCH. In the pre-TM period, 351 patients were transferred directly from the LCH for definitive management to the TC. In the post-TM period, 463 virtual consults were received, of which 51 patients were triaged to the TC. There were no differences in patient age, sex, or mode of transportation. When comparing post-TM with pre-TM era, patients had a higher Injury Severity Score (18 vs. 10, p {\textless} 0.001); less incidence of blunt trauma 35 (68\%) versus 290 (82\%), p {\textless} 0.05; a decrease in length of stay at LCH 1.5 hours versus 47 hours, p {\textless} 0.001; as well as TT LCH to TC 1.7 hours versus 13 hours, p {\textless} 0.001. After arrival to TC during the post-TM era patients received more units of packed red bed cell 13 units versus 5 units, p {\textless} 0.001 but without difference in mortality 4 (7.8\%) versus 17 (4.8\%), when compared with pre-TM era. Of statistical significance there was a dramatic decrease in hospital cost when comparing post-TM and pre-TM eras (\$1,126,683 vs. \$7,632,624, p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Telemedicine significantly improved rural LCH evaluation and management of trauma patients. More severely injured trauma patients were identified and more rapidly transferred to the TC. Total TC hospital costs were significantly decreased without significant changes in TC mortality. Introduction of telemedicine consultation to rural LCH emergency departments expanded LCH trauma capabilities and conserved TC resources, which were directed to more severely injured patients.},

One of the recent developments in this field is the use of direct-to-consumer (DTC) marketing to promote and advertise genetic and genomic consultant services to consumers. Using Google.com, we identified providers that promote their telegenetics services online. By analyzing their websites, we identify and examine key points regarding DTC telegenetics: how are telegenetics services portrayed, how is informed consent obtained, and what protections are offered to clients' personal health information? We found that the portrayal of a wide range of telegenetics services on providers' websites is extremely positive. The risks associated with the implementation of telegenetics were rarely mentioned. Consent forms were often unavailable and did not cover all of the relevant information. The measures for protecting clients' personal health information by telegenetics providers were found to be generally inadequate and weak. We concluded that DTC telegenetics may increase patients' access to genetic counseling with affordable costs. However, before further developing DTC telegenetics, more research and regulatory improvements are required to guarantee truthful advertising, ensure informed consent, secure personal health data sharing, and warrant adequate privacy protection.},

	abstract = {In the HIV Translating Initiatives for Depression into Effective Solutions project, we conducted a randomized controlled effectiveness and implementation trial comparing depression collaborative care with enhanced usual care in Veterans Health Administration HIV clinics in the US. An offsite HIV depression care team including a psychiatrist, a depression care manager (DCM), and a clinical pharmacist provided collaborative care using a stepped-care model of treatment and made recommendations to providers through the electronic health record system. The DCM delivered care management to HIV patients through phone calls, performing routine assessments and providing counseling in self-management and problem-solving. The DCM documented all calls in each patient's electronic medical record. In this paper we present results from interviews conducted with patients and clinical staff in a multi-stage formative evaluation (FE). We conducted semi-structured FE interviews with 26 HIV patients and 30 clinical staff at the three participating sites during and after the trial period to gather their experiences and perspectives concerning the intervention components. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using rapid content analysis techniques. Patients reported high satisfaction with the depression care manager (DCM) phone calls. Both HIV and mental health providers reported that the DCM's chart notes in the electronic health record were very helpful, and most felt that a dedicated DCM for HIV patients is ideal to meet patient needs. Sites encountered barriers to achieving and maintaining universal depression screening, but had greater success when such screening was incorporated into routine intake processes. FE results demonstrated that depression care management via telehealth from an offsite team is acceptable and helpful to both HIV patients and their providers. Given that a centralized offsite depression care team can deliver effective, cost-effective, cost-saving services for multiple HIV clinics in different locations with high patient and provider satisfaction, broad implementation should be considered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, spondyloarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease share similar underlying pathophysiological processes, providing the opportunity to treat the patients using similar biological therapies. Failure of biological treatments due to underexposure can be managed by therapeutic drug monitoring. Adjusting the treatment based on pharmacokinetic monitoring can be further improved by taking pharmacodynamic parameters such as clinical and molecular markers into account.
METHODS: Here, we critically evaluate the existing evidence, the hurdles to be taken and the opportunities for a widespread implementation of pharmacodynamic monitoring.
RESULTS: Pharmacodynamic monitoring typically is the monitoring of biochemical markers. A pharmacodynamic marker preferably is specific for the pharmacological action of a drug, but most of the time nonspecific pharmacodynamic markers are used, like C-reactive protein and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Clinical pharmacodynamic markers typically evaluate physical variables or symptoms. While physician-reported outcomes have been studied for a longer time and often have been shown to correlate well with molecular pharmacodynamic markers and treatment outcomes, the introduction of mobile health or mHealth technologies caused a shift towards patient-reported outcomes, with the associated challenge to consistently reflect the inflammatory state, thereby preventing undertreatment or unnecessary overdosing of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary goal of pharmacodynamic monitoring is to optimize the response, but it can also have an impact on safety, costs, patient adherence, etc. Ideally, the constant remote monitoring of patient-reported disease activity is expected to become the standard, facilitated by mHealth technologies.},

The program is sponsored by at-risk self-insured employers, health plans and provider organizations where it is free to members with diabetes or it is available directly to the person with diabetes where they cover the cost.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate BG data from 4544 individuals with diabetes who were enrolled in the Livongo program from October 2014 through December 2015.
METHODS: Members used the Livongo glucose meter to measure their BG levels an average of 1.8 times per day. We estimated the probability of having a day with a BG reading outside of the normal range (70-180 mg/dL, or 3.9-10.0 mmol/L) in months 2 to 12 compared with month 1 of the program, using individual fixed effects to control for individual characteristics.
RESULTS: Livongo members experienced an average 18.4\% decrease in the likelihood of having a day with hypoglycemia (BG {\textless}70 mg/dL) and an average 16.4\% decrease in hyperglycemia (BG {\textgreater}180 mg/dL) in months 2-12 compared with month 1 as the baseline. The biggest impact was seen on hyperglycemia for nonusers of insulin. We do not know all of the contributing factors such as medication or other treatment changes during the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that access to a connected glucose meter and certified diabetes educator coaching is associated with a decrease in the likelihood of abnormal glucose excursions, which can lead to diabetes-related health care savings.},

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study over 15 months.
SETTING: Four district hospitals in south-east England and a London paediatric cardiology centre.
PATIENTS: Babies and children.
INTERVENTION: A telecardiology service introduced alongside outreach clinics.
MEASUREMENTS: Clinical outcomes and mean NHS costs per patient.
RESULTS: 266 new patients were studied: 75 had teleconsultations (19 of 42 newborns and 56 of 224 infants and children). Teleconsultation patients generally were younger (49\% being under 1 year compared with 32\% seen personally (p = 0.025)) and their symptoms were not as severe. A cardiac intervention was undertaken immediately or planned for five telemedicine patients (7\%) and 30 conventional patients (16\%). However, similar proportions of patients were discharged after being assessed (32\% telemedicine and 39\% conventional). During scheduled teleconferences the mean duration of time per patient in sessions involving real-time echocardiography was 14.4 min, and 8.5 min in sessions where pre-recorded videos were transmitted. Mean cost comparisons for telemedicine and face-to-face patients over 14-day and 6-month follow-up showed the telecardiology service to be cost-neutral for the three hospitals with infrequently-held outreach clinics (1519 UK pounds vs 1724 UK pounds respectively after 14 days).
CONCLUSION: Paediatric cardiology centres with small cadres of specialists are under pressure to cope with ever-expanding caseloads of new patients with suspected anomalies. Innovative use of telecardiology alongside conventional outreach services should suitably, and economically, enhance access to these specialists.},

	abstract = {The credibility and reliability of health IT systems as a means of achieving changes towards safer and cost-effective care have been questioned for over two decades due to the lack of methodologically strong evidence. As national level adoption and implementation of health IT are becoming widespread across the EU and globally, but are also being offset by adverse reports, the demands for evidence become more pronounced and the stakes higher. The adaptation of HTA (health technology assessment) methodology as a means to address gaps in health IT evidence production has been proposed repeatedly and tested in the field of telemedicine services. HTA has in many ways run a course parallel to that of health IT, while in certain respects attaining more clear achievements. This contribution investigates aspects of a bilaterally beneficial relation between the two disciplines using three lines of exploration: the methodological goodness-of-fit between health IT evaluation and HTA; the solutions each has proposed to the problem of producing high quality evidence in reduced amount of time; and the way each has addressed the strengthened role and position of patients. The analysis demonstrates areas of convergence between health IT and HTA. It also highlights topics which would need to be jointly addressed in the process, such as innovative and high quality data collection and analysis, inclusion of patient reported outcomes and patient safety, and transferability and generalizability of findings. In closing, it takes a glimpse of the challenges emerging as a result of the progress at the cross-roads of medicine, science and technology.},

	abstract = {Background: Telemedicine is a rapidly growing tool since its invention in the 1950s. Recently, it has expanded to the field of plastic surgery. In the Connecticut VA System, there is 1 plastic surgeon at a central location for the state of Connecticut and southern Massachusetts. Our aim was to pilot a telehealth program for plastic surgery consultation within the VA to improve access to subspecialty care. We intend to discuss the value of telehealth as part of consultation services, and assess patient attitudes toward telemedicine.
Methods: Patients in the Connecticut VA System referred for plastic surgery consultation for evaluation of nonurgent diagnoses, such as skin lesions, carpal tunnel syndrome, and chronic wounds, were invited to participate. After being appropriately consented according to Connecticut state law, patients completed a postvisit questionnaire rating their overall satisfaction, quality of interaction, and ability to communicate using a modified 10-point Likert scale. Means were calculated for numerical responses. Preference for future telehealth visits was reported as a percentage.
Results: Forty-one of 44 eligible patients elected to participate. Of those patients, 83\% (n = 34) stated they prefer telemedicine services for future visits. Patients rated overall satisfaction 9.2/10, overall quality of interaction 9.2/10, ability to communicate 9.3/10, and sound and video quality 8.6/10 and 9.0/10, respectively.
Conclusion: Remote video telemedicine is a feasible method of plastic surgery consultation and results in high patient satisfaction. Further studies should focus on cost-effectiveness and ways to broaden the use of telehealth services in plastic surgery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although simplified visual stimuli, such as dots or gratings presented on homogeneous backgrounds, provide strict control over the stimulus parameters during visual experiments, they fail to approximate visual stimulation in natural conditions. Adoption of virtual reality (VR) in neuroscience research has been proposed to circumvent this problem, by combining strict control of experimental variables and behavioral monitoring within complex and realistic environments.
NEW METHOD: We have created a VR toolbox that maximizes experimental flexibility while minimizing implementation costs. A free VR engine (Unreal 3) has been customized to interface with any control software via text commands, allowing seamless introduction into pre-existing laboratory data acquisition frameworks. Furthermore, control functions are provided for the two most common programming languages used in visual neuroscience: Matlab and Python.
RESULTS: The toolbox offers milliseconds time resolution necessary for electrophysiological recordings and is flexible enough to support cross-species usage across a wide range of paradigms.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Unlike previously proposed VR solutions whose implementation is complex and time-consuming, our toolbox requires minimal customization or technical expertise to interface with pre-existing data acquisition frameworks as it relies on already familiar programming environments. Moreover, as it is compatible with a variety of display and input devices, identical VR testing paradigms can be used across species, from rodents to humans.
CONCLUSIONS: This toolbox facilitates the addition of VR capabilities to any laboratory without perturbing pre-existing data acquisition frameworks, or requiring any major hardware changes.},

One of the greatest challenges for the PA management in several biomes in the world is wildfires. The objective of this work was to evaluate the potentialities and limitations of the use of data obtained by orbital remote sensing in the monitoring fire occurrence in PAs. Fire Occurrence Records (FORs) were analyzed in Serra do Brigadeiro State Park, Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2007 to 2015, using photo interpreted data from TM, ETM+ and OLI sensors of the Landsat series and the Hot Spot Database (HSD) from the Brazilian Institute of Space Research - INPE. It was also observed the time of permanence of the scar left by fire on the landscape, through the multitemporal analysis of the behavior of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio) indexes, before and after the occurrence. The greatest limitation found for the orbital remote monitoring was the presence of clouds in the passage of the sensor in dates close to the occurrence of the fires. The burned area identified by photo interpretation was 54.9\% less than the area contained in the FOR. Although the HSD reported fire occurrences in the buffer zone (up to 10km from the Park), no FORs were found at a distance greater than 1100m from the boundaries of the PA. As the main potential of remote sensing, the possibility of identifying burned areas throughout the park and surroundings is highlighted, with low costs and greater accuracy.},

	volume = {16},
	issn = {1445-6354},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Little is known about Australian rural women's overall experiences of accessing an abortion service and the barriers they encounter. Approximately one in three Australian women access an abortion at some time in their lives. Most abortions are undertaken during the first trimester of pregnancy in private clinics. Although both medical and surgical abortions are uncomplicated medical procedures, abortion remains a contentious area of women's health. Whilst it is clear that rural women experience disparities in relation to access to health care, there is a gap in the evidence on rural women's experiences of accessing an abortion. The aim of the present study was to identify factors that women in rural New South Wales (NSW) experience in accessing abortion services and suggestions about how rural women could be better supported when seeking access to an abortion service.
METHODS: In-depth qualitative interviews were undertaken with rural women living in NSW who had had an abortion in the previous 15 years. Participants self-selected for a phone or face-to-face interview, in response to promotion of the study through women's services, community flyers and press releases.
RESULTS: Rural women in this study experienced many barriers to accessing an abortion. Women travelled 1-9 hours one way to access an abortion in clinics. Several women borrowed money for the abortion fee. Five themes were identified: finding information about the provider; stigma, shame and secrecy; logistics involved in accessing the clinic related to travel, money and support; medical and surgical abortion; and ways rural women could be better supported in this process. Suggestions to improve rural women's access to abortion services included more affordable services that were 'closer to home' as a way to reduce travel and cost, and to normalise abortion as a women's health rights issue.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite welcome legal and pharmaceutical reform in Australia, results from this small study indicate that there is a long way to go remove barriers on issues rural women experience in their process of accessing reproductive care, including the pervasiveness of abortion stigma. Services closer to home may help reduce inequities in access to health care experienced by rural women. Strategies such as broader use of tele-health and willingness of general practitioners to become authorised prescribers for medical abortions could help to reduce long distances to travel to services and the financial burden experienced by rural women.},

	abstract = {The teleoncology practice based at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) in Kansas City, Kansas, is one of the longest running practices of its kind worldwide. The practice began in 1995 and connected an oncologist at KUMC with a rural medical center in Hays, Kansas. Fifteen years later, the practice continues to thrive at Hays Medical Center and has also expanded to include two additional sites within the state-the Northeast Kansas Center for Health and Wellness in Horton and Goodland Regional Medical Center in Goodland-that offer regularly scheduled teleoncology clinics. While the KUMC practice has witnessed an expansion in service sites throughout its history, the practice has seen a significant decrease in the costs associated with providing such services since its inception. The cost decrease can, in part, be attributed to an increase in the number of teleoncology visits conducted through the practice since it began. In Fiscal Year 1995 (FY 1995), 103 teleoncology visits resulted in a cost per visit of \$812. Five years later, the FY 2000 \$410 per visit cost for 121 visits was almost half the cost identified in the initial cost analysis. The FY 2003 cost per visit for 219 visits saw another decrease to \$401, and the most recent FY 2005 cost analysis yielded another decrease to \$251 per visit for 235 visits. The data reported below are likely to be the best now available to track time trends in the cost of providing telemedicine or telehealth consultations. The Conclusion and Policy Recommendations at the end of this article will focus on both the cost-time profile and some other challenges and lessons learned.},

To evaluate ways in which the Affordable Care Act will likely impact the practice of critical care medicine.

DATA SOURCES AND SYNTHESIS: Data sources for this concise review include search results from the PubMed and Embase databases, as well as sources relevant to public policy such as the text of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and reports of the Congressional Budget Office. As all of the Affordable Care Act's provisions will not be fully implemented until 2019, we also drew upon cost, population, and utilization projections, as well as the experience of existing state-based healthcare reforms.
CONCLUSIONS: The Affordable Care Act represents the furthest reaching regulatory changes in the U.S. healthcare system since the 1965 Medicare and Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act. The Affordable Care Act aims to expand health insurance coverage to millions of Americans and place an emphasis on quality and cost-effectiveness of care. From models which link pay and performance to those which center on episodic care, the Affordable Care Act outlines sweeping changes to health systems, reimbursement structures, and the delivery of critical care. Staffing models that include daily rounding by an intensivist, palliative care integration, and expansion of the role of telemedicine in areas where intensivists are inaccessible are potential strategies that may improve quality and profitability of ICU care in the post-Affordable Care Act era.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although rehabilitation therapy is commonly provided after stroke, many patients do not derive maximal benefit because of access, cost, and compliance. A telerehabilitation-based program may overcome these barriers. We designed, then evaluated a home-based telerehabilitation system in patients with chronic hemiparetic stroke.
METHODS: Patients were 3 to 24 months poststroke with stable arm motor deficits. Each received 28 days of telerehabilitation using a system delivered to their home. Each day consisted of 1 structured hour focused on individualized exercises and games, stroke education, and an hour of free play.
RESULTS: Enrollees (n = 12) had baseline Fugl-Meyer (FM) scores of 39 ± 12 (mean ± SD). Compliance was excellent: participants engaged in therapy on 329/336 (97.9\%) assigned days. Arm repetitions across the 28 days averaged 24,607 ± 9934 per participant. Arm motor status showed significant gains (FM change 4.8 ± 3.8 points, P = .0015), with half of the participants exceeding the minimal clinically important difference. Although scores on tests of computer literacy declined with age ( r = -0.92; P {\textless} .0001), neither the motor gains nor the amount of system use varied with computer literacy. Daily stroke education via the telerehabilitation system was associated with a 39\% increase in stroke prevention knowledge ( P = .0007). Depression scores obtained in person correlated with scores obtained via the telerehabilitation system 16 days later ( r = 0.88; P = .0001). In-person blood pressure values closely matched those obtained via this system ( r = 0.99; P {\textless} .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: This home-based system was effective in providing telerehabilitation, education, and secondary stroke prevention to participants. Use of a computer-based interface offers many opportunities to monitor and improve the health of patients after stroke.},

	doi = {10.1089/tmj.2013.0211},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both primary care and specialty care in many areas face access constraints. Tools to evaluate and engage patients with chronic disease, without having them present to the clinic, are needed. Asynchronous virtual care has been explored as one of the ways to deliver care more efficiently, yet this has not been integrated into a busy practice environment. This pilot study aims to assess the utility of a Web platform that allows patients with chronic disease to be evaluated for follow-up care, thereby avoiding an office visit.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with 10 common chronic conditions were recruited into the study at a busy primary care clinic. Instead of booking an in-office follow-up visit, they were directed online to complete a questionnaire pertaining to their condition 7-28 days after their office visit. Their physician would review their responses and make treatment decisions, informing the patient online. Patient and physician satisfaction was measured using a validated Likert scale after each visit.
RESULTS: Patients were satisfied with the Web site and process as a way to receive their follow-up care. Clinicians were satisfied in making clinical decisions with the information received via the Web site. The clinician time spent for the overall encounter was significantly shorter than for an in-person follow-up visit.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and patients are interested in tools that improve patient health, are convenient, and save time for both parties. Targeting patients with chronic illness and leveraging available technology to deliver the care are very satisfactory to both clinicians and patients. Asynchronous virtual visits for patients with chronic medical conditions are an effective way to evaluate and manage patients, while providing physicians significant time savings. These visits have the potential to reduce in-office follow-up visits across primary care, potentially improving access and reducing costs.},

DESIGN: A prospective within-trial patient-level economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Patients recruited through primary care, and intervention delivered via telehealth service.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults with a 10-year CVD risk ≥20\%, as measured by the QRISK2 algorithm, with at least 1 modifiable risk factor.
INTERVENTION: A series of up to 13 scripted, theory-led telehealth encounters with healthcare advisors, who supported participants to make behaviour change, use online resources, optimise medication and improve adherence. Participants in the control arm received usual care.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness measured by net monetary benefit at the end of 12 months of follow-up, calculated from incremental cost and incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Productivity impacts, participant out-of-pocket expenditure and the clinical outcome were presented in a cost-consequences framework.
RESULTS: 641 participants were randomised-325 to receive the telehealth intervention in addition to usual care and 316 to receive only usual care. 18\% of participants had missing data on either costs, utilities or both. Multiple imputation was used for the base case results. The intervention was associated with incremental mean per-patient National Health Service (NHS) costs of £138 (95\% CI 66 to 211) and an incremental QALY gain of 0.012 (95\% CI -0.001 to 0.026). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £10 859. Net monetary benefit at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per QALY was £116 (95\% CI -58 to 291), and the probability that the intervention was cost-effective at this threshold value was 0.77. Similar results were obtained from a complete case analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that the Healthlines telehealth intervention was likely to be cost-effective at a threshold of £20 000 per QALY.

AIMS: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a telehealth intervention ('Healthlines') for patients with depression.
METHOD: A prospective patient-level economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial. Patients were recruited through primary care, and the intervention was delivered via a telehealth service. Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of depression and PHQ-9 score ≥10 were recruited from 43 English general practices. A series of up to 10 scripted, theory-led, telephone encounters with health information advisers supported participants to effect a behaviour change, use online resources, optimise medication and improve adherence. The intervention was delivered alongside usual care and was designed to support rather than duplicate primary care. Cost-effectiveness from a combined health and social care perspective was measured by net monetary benefit at the end of 12 months of follow-up, calculated from incremental cost and incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost-consequence analysis included cost of lost productivity, participant out-of-pocket expenditure and the clinical outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 609 participants were randomised - 307 to receive the Healthlines intervention plus usual care and 302 to receive usual care alone. Forty-five per cent of participants had missing quality of life data, 41\% had missing cost data and 51\% of participants had missing data on either cost or utility, or both. Multiple imputation was used for the base-case analysis. The intervention was associated with incremental mean per-patient National Health Service/personal social services cost of £168 (95\% CI £43 to £294) and an incremental QALY gain of 0.001 (95\% CI -0.023 to 0.026). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £132 630. Net monetary benefit at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000 was -£143 (95\% CI -£164 to -£122) and the probability of the intervention being cost-effective at this threshold value was 0.30. Productivity costs were higher in the intervention arm, but out-of-pocket expenses were lower.
CONCLUSIONS: The Healthlines service was acceptable to patients as a means of condition management, and response to treatment after 4 months was higher for participants randomised to the intervention. However, the positive average intervention effect size was modest, and incremental costs were high relative to a small incremental QALY gain at 12 months. The intervention is not likely to be cost-effective in its current form.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term cost-effectiveness (measured as the ratio of incremental NHS cost to incremental quality-adjusted life years) of a telehealth intervention for patients with raised cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
DESIGN: A cohort simulation model developed as part of the economic evaluation conducted alongside the Healthlines randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Patients recruited through primary care, and intervention delivered via telehealth service.
PARTICIPANTS: Participants with a 10-year CVD risk ≥20\%, as measured by the QRISK2 algorithm, and with at least 1 modifiable risk factor, individually randomised from 42 general practices in England.
INTERVENTION: A telehealth service delivered over a 12-month period. The intervention involved a series of responsive, theory-led encounters between patients and trained health information advisors who provided access to information resources and supported medication adherence and coordination of care.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness measured by net monetary benefit over the simulated lifetime of trial participants from a UK National Health Service perspective.
RESULTS: The probability that the intervention was cost-effective depended on the duration of the effect of the intervention. The intervention was cost-effective with high probability if effects persisted over the lifetime of intervention recipients. The probability of cost-effectiveness was lower for shorter durations of effect.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was likely to be cost-effective under a lifetime perspective.

	abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to revolutionize the way research is conducted in many scientific fields. UAVs can access remote or difficult terrain, collect large amounts of data for lower cost than traditional aerial methods, and facilitate observations of species that are wary of human presence. Currently, despite large regulatory hurdles, UAVs are being deployed by researchers and conservationists to monitor threats to biodiversity, collect frequent aerial imagery, estimate population abundance, and deter poaching. Studies have examined the behavioral responses of wildlife to aircraft (including UAVs), but with the widespread increase in UAV flights, it is critical to understand whether UAVs act as stressors to wildlife and to quantify that impact. Biologger technology allows for the remote monitoring of stress responses in free-roaming individuals, and when linked to locational information, it can be used to determine events or components of an animal's environment that elicit a physiological response not apparent based on behavior alone. We assessed effects of UAV flights on movements and heart rate responses of free-roaming American black bears. We observed consistently strong physiological responses but infrequent behavioral changes. All bears, including an individual denned for hibernation, responded to UAV flights with elevated heart rates, rising as much as 123 beats per minute above the pre-flight baseline. It is important to consider the additional stress on wildlife from UAV flights when developing regulations and best scientific practices.},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.4568},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the global prevalence of insufficient physical activity (PA), effective interventions that attenuate age-related decline in PA levels are needed. Mobile phone interventions that positively affect health (mHealth) show promise; however, their impact on PA levels and fitness in young people is unclear and little is known about what makes a good mHealth app.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the effects of two commercially available smartphone apps (Zombies, Run and Get Running) on cardiorespiratory fitness and PA levels in insufficiently active healthy young people. A second aim was to identify the features of the app design that may contribute to improved fitness and PA levels.
METHODS: Apps for IMproving FITness (AIMFIT) was a 3-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants were recruited through advertisements in electronic mailing lists, local newspapers, flyers posted in community locations, and presentations at schools. Eligible young people aged 14-17 years were allocated at random to 1 of 3 conditions: (1) use of an immersive app (Zombies, Run), (2) use of a nonimmersive app (Get Running), or (3) usual behavior (control). Both smartphone apps consisted of a fully automated 8-week training program designed to improve fitness and ability to run 5 km; however, the immersive app featured a game-themed design and narrative. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using data collected face-to-face at baseline and 8 weeks, and all regression models were adjusted for baseline outcome value and gender. The primary outcome was cardiorespiratory fitness, objectively assessed as time to complete the 1-mile run/walk test at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were PA levels (accelerometry and self-reported), enjoyment, psychological need satisfaction, self-efficacy, and acceptability and usability of the apps.
RESULTS: A total of 51 participants were randomized to the immersive app intervention (n=17), nonimmersive app intervention (n=16), or the control group (n=18). The mean age of participants was 15.7 (SD 1.2) years; participants were mostly NZ Europeans (61\%, 31/51) and 57\% (29/51) were female. Overall retention rate was 96\% (49/51). There was no significant intervention effect on the primary outcome using either of the apps. Compared to the control, time to complete the fitness test was -28.4 seconds shorter (95\% CI -66.5 to 9.82, P=.20) for the immersive app group and -24.7 seconds (95\% CI -63.5 to 14.2, P=.32) for the nonimmersive app group. No significant intervention effects were found for secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Although apps have the ability to increase reach at a low cost, our pragmatic approach using readily available commercial apps as a stand-alone instrument did not have a significant effect on fitness. However, interest in future use of PA apps is promising and highlights a potentially important role of these tools in a multifaceted approach to increase fitness, promote PA, and consequently reduce the adverse health outcomes associated with insufficient activity.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients with diabetes require insulin therapy to achieve optimal glycemic control. Initiation and titration of insulin often require an insulin dose adjustment (IDA) program, involving frequent exchange of blood glucose levels (BGLs) and insulin prescription advice between the patient and healthcare team. This process is time consuming with logistical barriers.
OBJECTIVE: To develop an innovative mobile health (m-Health) mobile-based IDA program (mIDA) and evaluate the user adherence and experience through a proof-of-concept trial.
METHODS: In the program, an m-Health system was designed to be integrated within a clinical IDA service, comprising a Bluetooth-enabled glucose meter, smartphone application, and clinician portal. Insulin-requiring patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus and stable BGL were recruited to use the m-Health system to record and exchange BGL entries, insulin dosages, and clinical messages for 2 weeks. The user experience was evaluated by a Likert scale questionnaire.
RESULTS: Nine participants, aged 58 ± 14 years (mean ± SD), completed the trial with average daily records of 3.1 BGL entries and 1.2 insulin dosage entries. The participants recognized the potential value of the clinical messages. They felt confident about managing their diabetes and were positive regarding ease of use and family support of the system, but disagreed that there were no technical issues. Finally, they were satisfied with the program and would continue to use it if possible.
CONCLUSIONS: The m-Health system for IDA showed promising levels of adherence, usability, perception of usefulness, and satisfaction. Further research is required to assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of using this system in outpatient settings.},

METHOD: This was a secondary analysis of a randomized clincial trial with 134 rural-dwelling adults 65 years and older with decreased quality of life and elevated psychological symptomatology. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the anxiety and phobic anxiety subscales of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R).
RESULTS: Compared to a minimal support control condition, CBT for depression resulted in significantly greater improvements in symptoms of anxiety and phobic anxiety from pre-treatment to post-treatment.
CONCLUSION: Home-delivered CBT for depression can be an effective treatment for anxiety in a hard-to-reach older populations.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Additional research should explore integrated anxiety and depression protocols and other treatment modalities, including bibliotherapy or telehealth models of CBT, to reduce costs associated with its in home delivery. Flexibility in administration and adaptations to the CBT protocol may be necessary for use with vulnerable, rural older adults.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design of a novel wireless sensor network structure to monitor patients with chronic diseases in their own homes through a remote monitoring system of physiological signals. Currently, most of the monitoring systems send patients' data to a hospital with the aid of personal computers (PC) located in the patients' home. Here, we present a new design which eliminates the need for a PC. The proposed remote monitoring system is a wireless sensor network with the nodes of the network installed in the patients' homes. These nodes are then connected to a central node located at a hospital through an Internet connection. The nodes of the proposed wireless sensor network are created by using a combination of ECG sensors, MSP430 microcontrollers, a CC2500 low-power wireless radio, and a network protocol called the SimpliciTI protocol. ECG signals are first sampled by a small portable device which each patient carries. The captured signals are then wirelessly transmitted to an access point located within the patients' home. This connectivity is based on wireless data transmission at 2.4-GHz frequency. The access point is also a small box attached to the Internet through a home asynchronous digital subscriber line router. Afterwards, the data are sent to the hospital via the Internet in real time for analysis and/or storage. The benefits of this remote monitoring are wide ranging: the patients can continue their normal lives, they do not need a PC all of the time, their risk of infection is reduced, costs significantly decrease for the hospital, and clinicians can check data in a short time.},

We have developed and validated a device, the ototoxicity identification device (OtoID), which enables remote hearing monitoring by a patient during chemotherapy treatment. Aspects of the design such as patient self-testing and texting of results to the audiology clinic are important features of this device.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to present the efficacy and effectiveness of the OtoID hearing screener.
RESEARCH DESIGN: A repeated measures design was used in this study.
STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-one veterans undergoing cisplatin chemotherapy were recruited in this study.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Participants were tested using the OtoID at each cisplatin treatment by an audiologist using the manual mode of test and the participant using the automated mode of test. Test sensitivity and specificity were developed from the detection (yes/no) of an American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) change in hearing.
RESULTS: The OtoID had a test sensitivity of 80.6\% and specificity of 85.3\%. A logistic regression model analysis of the probability of an ASHA shift identified by the automated OtoID was conducted. Separate models were fit to establish effects of age, average baseline thresholds in the sensitive range for ototoxicity (SRO), and dose of cisplatin on the probability of a positive hearing change result. Interactions were also included to evaluate these effects on the sensitivity and false-positive rates of the automated test. Results indicated no statistically significant effects of age, of baseline hearing in the SRO frequencies, or of cisplatin dose.
CONCLUSIONS: The OtoID automated test can be recommended for use. The automated test provides significant personnel efficiencies. The modem with simple text messaging function recently added to the device improves on these efficiencies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blended care, meaning that online (Internet) components are used in combination with face-to-face contact, in mental health is increasingly encouraged, but research about the needs of psychologists is scarce.
METHODS: We assessed the perceptions, design, and barriers toward blended care among members of the Dutch Association of Psychologists through an e-mailed survey. Mean scores (SD) and answer percentages were calculated. Mann-Whitney tests were performed to investigate differences between users and nonusers and primary- and secondary care professionals.
RESULTS: Generally, psychologists (63\% response rate) had a positive perception toward blended care and they intended to use it in future (M = 3.71, SD = 1.19). Users of blended care and secondary care professionals were more positive toward blended care than nonusers and primary care professionals. Online psychoeducation, diary forms, and exercises for different therapeutic approaches and communication technology configurations were most welcomed. Still, quite some barriers were mentioned before professionals would use blended care.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychologists had a positive perception toward blended care, as long as attention is paid to the perceived barriers. Results of this survey could be used in the development of online components that correspond to the needs of professionals. Reviewing the needs of psychologists, e-health components of different therapeutic approaches, apart from cognitive behavioral therapy, are welcomed. Future research is necessary to gain insight in the (cost) effectiveness of blended care for different types of patients (e.g., transdiagnostic interventions) and of different therapeutic approaches.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The use of telepathology in intraoperative consultations has been increasing due to limited time and availability of pathologists, and the demand for increased access to pathology subspecialists in difficult cases. The five main categories of telepathology are (1) static, (2) dynamic, (3) robotic, (4) whole slide imaging (WSI), and (5) hybrid methods. The majority of these methods have been found to offer diagnostic accuracy rates similar to conventional microscopy, at the cost of slightly prolonged time to evaluate slides. Areas covered: Herein we discuss the salient features of each telepathology method and provide examples of their performance reported in the literature. Expert commentary: Telepathology systems from any of the aforementioned categories can be employed to achieve timely and accurate diagnoses as long as they meet clinical needs and are validated for the intended use case. The decision to purchase a particular system depends on the clinical application, specific needs and budget of the laboratory, as well as the personal preference of the telepathologists involved. The adoption of telepathology practice is likely to expand in order to meet the increasing demand for subspecialist consultation and as technology advances to improve diagnostic accuracy and workflow.},

It was based on the use of an ambulance equipped with a scanner, a point-of-care laboratory, and telemedicine capabilities (Mobile Stroke Unit). Despite demonstrating a marked reduction in the delay to thrombolysis, this strategy is criticized because of potentially unacceptable costs.
METHODS: We related the incremental direct costs of prehospital stroke treatment based on data of the first trial on this concept to one year direct cost savings taken from published research results. Key parameters were configuration of emergency medical service personnel, operating distance, and population density. Model parameters were varied to cover 5 different relevant emergency medical service scenarios. Additionally, the effects of operating distance and population density on benefit-cost ratios were analyzed.
RESULTS: Benefits of the concept of prehospital stroke treatment outweighed its costs with a benefit-cost ratio of 1.96 in the baseline experimental setting. The benefit-cost ratio markedly increased with the reduction of the staff and with higher population density. Maximum benefit-cost ratios between 2.16 and 6.85 were identified at optimum operating distances in a range between 43.01 and 64.88 km (26.88 and 40.55 miles). Our model implies that in different scenarios the Mobile Stroke Unit strategy is cost-efficient starting from an operating distance of 15.98 km (9.99 miles) or from a population density of 79 inhabitants per km2 (202 inhabitants per square mile).
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that based on a one-year benefit-cost analysis that prehospital treatment of acute stroke is highly cost-effective across a wide range of possible scenarios. It is the highest when the staff size of the Mobile Stroke Unit can be reduced, for example, by the use of telemedical support from hospital experts. Although efficiency is positively related to population density, benefit-cost ratios can be greater than 1 even in rural settings.},

Replacement-related adverse events are difficult to identify and require monitoring of both short-term complications and long-term patient outcome. The aim of this study is to perform a structured evaluation of both short- and long-term adverse events and a cost analysis of consecutive ICD replacement procedures. Detect Long-term Complications After ICD Replacement (DECODE) is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter cohort study designed to estimate long-term complication rates (at 12 months and 5 years) in patients undergoing ICD generator replacement. The study will also evaluate predictors of complications, patient management before and during the replacement procedure in clinical practice, and the costs related to use of health care resources. About 800 consecutive patients with standard indications for ICD generator replacement will be enrolled in this study. The decision to undertake generator replacement/upgrade will be made according to the investigators' own judgment (which will be recorded). Patients will be followed for 60 months through periodic in-hospital examinations or remote monitoring. Detailed data on complications related to ICD replacement in current clinical practice are still lacking. The analysis of adverse events will reveal the value of new preventive strategies, thereby yielding both clinical and economic benefits. Moreover, assessment of complication rates after ICD replacement in a real-life setting will help estimate the actual long-term cost of ICD therapy and assess the real impact of increasing ICD longevity on cost-effectiveness.},

METHODS: We address shortcomings of existing consumer-level health informatics applications in supporting senior health consumers, and provide designers of such systems with a design framework. We assess the feasibility of patient-centred health management systems (HMSs) that are designed based on the proposed framework. In contrast to traditional telehealth, HMSs are patient centred and aim at enabling health consumers to take control of their own health by providing functionality for health self-management. Quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted in evaluating a prototype HMS.
RESULTS: Senior healthcare consumers viewed our HMS prototype positively, and experienced a positive change in their attitude towards their health. We identified requirements and challenges for HMSs. In particular, participants indicated that social networking features must have a clear purpose beyond simple broadcasting of emotions and opinions.
DISCUSSION: Our study indicates that seniors are able and motivated to leverage a web-based patient-centred HMS, provided that there are suitable health support applications tailored to their needs. This could be achieved by making it attractive for third party application developers to contribute HMS content.},

We compared the number of transfers, average hospital revenue, and average professional billing revenue before and after the deployment of telemedicine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of hospital and physician billing records for patients transferred from 16 hospitals where telemedicine services were implemented between July 2003 and December 2010. Hospital revenue was defined as total revenue minus operating costs. Professional billing revenue was defined as total payment received as the result of physician billing of patients' insurance. We compared the number of transfers, average net hospital revenue per year, and average professional billing revenue per year before and after the deployment of telemedicine at these hospitals.
RESULTS: There were 2,029 children transferred to the children's hospital from the 16 hospitals with telemedicine during the study period. The average number of patients transferred per year to the children's hospital increased from 143 pre-telemedicine to 285 post-telemedicine. From these patients, the average hospital revenue increased from \$2.4 million to \$4.0 million per year, and the average professional billing revenue increased from \$313,977 to \$688,443 per year. On average, per hospital, following the deployment of telemedicine, hospital revenue increased by \$101,744 per year, and professional billing revenue increased by \$23,404 per year.
CONCLUSIONS: In a competitive healthcare region with more than one children's hospital, deploying pediatric telemedicine services to referring hospitals resulted in an increased market share and an increased number of transfers, hospital revenue, and professional billing revenue.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Medication nonadherence is a serious issue in clinical trials, especially in studies of substance abuse disorders. Measuring and confirming adherence is critical to ensuring that collected data is accurate and interpretable. This study evaluated the feasibility and success of a smartphone-based approach (Cellphone Assisted Remote Observation of Medication Adherence [CAROMA]) to visually confirm medication adherence in a clinical trial.
METHOD: Medication adherence was confirmed visually via smartphones provided to participants in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial for cannabis dependence. Every morning, subjects (n=20) were video-called by staff who observed consumption of study medication. Adherence was also assessed with weekly face-to-face visits, pill counts and plasma drug levels. Subjects were paid for completing daily CAROMA visits, and for returning the smartphone at study completion.
RESULTS: CAROMA confirmed 96.04\% adherence to medication. Concordance between expected and actual remaining study medication counted at weekly study visits was 87.69\%. Subjects assigned to active study medication had detectable plasma drug levels, while those assigned to placebo did not. CAROMA was estimated to cost approximately \$100 per subject per week - a total of \$300.24 per subject for the 3-week outpatient portion of the trial.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility, success and cost-effectiveness of CAROMA to facilitate and confirm medication adherence in a clinical trial. Preliminary findings support larger and longer studies, and possibly applying this approach to clinical care - especially in other populations with high rates of medication nonadherence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing use of Web-based solutions for health prevention and promotion presents opportunities to improve self-management and adherence to guideline-based therapy for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Despite promising preliminary evidence, many users stop using Web-based solutions due to the burden of data entry, hidden costs, loss of interest, and a lack of comprehensive features. Evaluations tend to focus on effectiveness or impact and fail to evaluate the nuanced variables that may interact to contribute to outcome success (or failure).
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate a Web-based solution for improving self-management in T2DM to identify key combinations of contextual variables and mechanisms of action that explain for whom the solution worked best and in what circumstances.
METHODS: A qualitative realist evaluation was conducted with one-on-one, semistructured telephonic interviews completed at baseline, and again toward the end of the intervention period (3 months). Topics included participants' experiences of using the Web-based solution, barriers and facilitators of self-management, and barriers and facilitators to effective use. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis strategies, after which the key themes were used to develop statements of the relationships between the key contextual factors, mechanisms of action, and impact on the primary outcome (glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c).
RESULTS: Twenty-six interviews (14 baseline, 12 follow-up) were completed with 16 participants with T2DM, and the following 3 key groups emerged: the easiest fit, the best fit, and those who failed to activate. Self-efficacy and willingness to engage with the solution facilitated improvement in HbA1c, whereas competing priorities and psychosocial issues created barriers to engagement. Individuals with high baseline self-efficacy who were motivated, took ownership for their actions, and prioritized diabetes management were early and eager adopters of the app and recorded improvements in HbA1c over the intervention period. Individuals with moderate baseline self-efficacy and no competing priorities, who identified gaps in understanding of how their actions influence their health, were slow to adopt use but recorded the greatest improvements in HbA1c. The final group had low baseline self-efficacy and identified a range of psychosocial issues and competing priorities. These participants were uncertain of the benefits of using a Web-based solution to support self-management, ultimately resulting in minimal engagement and no improvement in HbA1c.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-efficacy, competing priorities, previous behavior change, and beliefs about Web-based solutions interact to determine engagement and impact on the clinical outcomes. Considering the balance of these patient characteristics is likely to help health care providers identify individuals who are apt to benefit from a Web-based solution to support self-management of T2DM. Web-based solutions could be modified to incorporate the existing screening measures to identify individuals who are at risk of suboptimal adherence to inform the provision of additional support(s) as needed.},

	abstract = {Aims: To evaluate the effect of telemonitoring on adherence to non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.
Methods and results: A randomized, single-blind, crossover, controlled trial in 48 AF patients on once or twice daily (OD or BID) NOAC. The Medication Event Monitoring System tracked NOAC intake during three phases of 3 months each: daily telemonitoring, telemonitoring with immediate telephone feedback in case of intake errors, and an observation phase without daily transmissions. Unprotected days were defined as ≥ 3 or ≥ 1 consecutively missed doses for a BID or OD NOAC, respectively, or excess dose intake. Cost-effectiveness was calculated based on anticipated stroke reduction derived from patients' risk profile and measured intake. Persistence over the entire study was 98\%. Telemonitoring-only already led to very high taking and regimen adherence (97.4\% respectively 93.8\%). Nevertheless, direct feedback further improved both to 99.0\% and 96.8\%, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001 respectively P = 0.002). Observation without daily monitoring resulted in a significant waning of taking adherence (94.3\%; P = 0.049). Taking adherence was significantly higher for OD compared to BID NOAC, although unprotected days were similar. Feedback intervention had an incremental cost of €344 289 to prevent one stroke, but this could be as low as €15 488 in high-risk patients with low adherence and optimized technology.
Conclusion: Telemonitoring resulted in high NOAC adherence due to the notion of being watched, as evidenced by the rapid decline during the observation period. Feedback further optimized adherence. Telemonitoring with or without feedback may be a cost-effective approach in high-risk patients deemed poorly adherent.},

Their impact on healthcare costs, however, has yet to be investigated. This study aims to determine the cost-benefits of such interventions in comparison to routine care.
OBJECTIVES: To analyze the cost-benefit of an Internet Blood Glucose Monitoring Service (IBGMS) in comparison to routine diabetes care.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 200 patients were surveyed to assess the cost associated with doctor appointments in the past 12 months. Annual number of visits to medical services for diabetes and costs of transportation, parking, and time taken off work for visits were surveyed. Self-reported frequency of SMBG and most recent A1C were also surveyed. We compared 100 patients who used the IBGMS with 100 patients who only used routine care.
RESULTS: There is a trend of lowered total cost in the intervention group compared to the control group. The control group spent \$210.89 per year on visits to physicians; the intervention group spent \$131.26 (P = 0.128). Patients in control group visited their endocrinologist 1.76 times per year, those in intervention group visited their endocrinologist 1.36 times per year, significantly less frequently than the control group (P = 0.014). Number of visits to other medical services is similar between the groups. Average A1C in intervention group is 7.57\%, in control group is 7.69\% (P = 0.309).
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that IBGMS, while not reaching statistical significance, may be associated with slightly reduced A1C and cost due to visiting physicians.},

METHODS: Data collected included the distance from the patient's home to the main Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center, the distance from the patient's home to the community based outpatient clinic (CBOC), travel distance saved for the patient, and travel pay status. Following CVT clinic appointments patients were asked to complete a written feedback assessment to evaluate patient satisfaction. All data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Veterans saved 8,981 miles in travel distance, and the VA saved \$2,317.51 due to averted travel reimbursement. There was a 90\% satisfaction rate with the CVT pain management clinic services, and 90\% of patients agreed that they would recommend telehealth to other veterans.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, patients are satisfied with the CVT pain management clinic. Furthermore, the substantial miles saved for the patients, as well as the cost savings for the VA, indicates that this service has tangible benefits. As this clinic continues to operate, it can be expected that miles saved for patients and cost savings for the VA will continue to grow.},

Current technologies used to conduct remote patient assessments have high start-up costs, yet they cannot consistently establish quality timely connections. Smartphones can be used for high-quality video teleconferencing. They are inexpensive and ubiquitous among health care providers. We aimed to study the reliability of high-quality video teleconferencing using smartphones for conducting the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).
METHODS: Two vascular neurologists assessed 100 stroke patients with the NIHSS. The remote vascular neurologist assessed subjects using smartphone videoconferencing with the assistance of a bedside medical aide. The bedside vascular neurologist scored patients contemporaneously. Each vascular neurologist was blinded to the other's NIHSS scores. We tested the inter-method agreement and physician satisfaction with the device.
RESULTS: We demonstrated high total NIHSS score correlation between the methods (r=0.949; P{\textless}0.001). The mean total NIHSS scores for bedside and remote assessments were 7.93±8.10 and 7.28±7.85, with ranges, of 0 to 35 and 0 to 37, respectively. Eight categories had high agreement: level of consciousness (questions), level of consciousness (commands), visual fields, motor left and right (arm and leg), and best language. Six categories had moderate agreement: level of consciousness (consciousness), best gaze, facial palsy, sensory, dysarthria, and extinction/inattention. Ataxia had poor agreement. There was high physician satisfaction with the smartphone.
CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone high-quality video teleconferencing is reliable, easy to use, affordable for telestroke NIHSS administration, and has high physician satisfaction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A hub-and-spoke telestroke network is an effective way to extend quality emergency stroke care to remote hospitals and improve patient outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost utility of a telestroke network in the management of acute ischemic stroke from the societal perspective.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was developed to compare the incremental costs and effectiveness of a telestroke network. One-year transition probabilities between the 3 health states based on the modified Rankin scale--minimal-to-no disability, moderate-to-severe disability, and death--were derived from literature. Costs included telemedicine setup and maintenance, initial and recurrent stroke treatment, rehabilitation, long-term care, and caregiver costs. Effectiveness was defined as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Model inputs were obtained from the literature supplemented by data from Georgia Health Sciences University and Mayo Clinic. The base case network included 1 hub and 7 spokes, and assumed no survival benefits from acute treatment in a network. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: Compared with no network, patients treated in a telestroke network incurred \$1436 lower costs and gained 0.02 QALYs over a lifetime. Incremental costs decreased from \$444 for the first year to -\$1436 over a lifetime; incremental QALYs increased from 0.002 for the first year to 0.02 over a lifetime. Overall, results were robust in the 1-way sensitivity analyses. A telestroke network became less cost-effective with increasing spoke-to-hub transfer rates.
CONCLUSIONS: A telestroke network is cost savingand more effective compared with no network from the societal perspective in most modeled scenarios.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To overcome the problem of maldistribution of dermatologists in rural areas, live interactive teleconsultation systems are being used in some countries. However, these systems are not in common use because few evaluations on their efficiency and economic viability were reported.
METHODS: We constructed an easy-to-use asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)-based live interactive teleconsultation system and conducted 150 trial sessions between two rural hospitals and Shimane University Hospital. The clinical usefulness and economic advantages of this system were evaluated using data obtained from the trials.
RESULTS: The system efficiently captured images at a resolution sufficient for specialized consultations: follicular openings were visible in the images obtained from a distance of 2 m. This system is more advantageous than a conventional clinic if the following condition is fulfilled: y ≤ 6.00 x-3.86 [x, time required for one-way travel (h); y, time required for consultation (h)]. Our two lines in trial fulfilled this condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Asymmetric digital subscriber line-based live interactive teleconsultation technology is beneficial in many rural hospitals that do not have a dermatologist.},

Objective: To analyze the economic outcomes of the Blood Pressure Telemonitoring and Pharmacist Management on Blood Pressure (Hyperlink) study, a cluster randomized controlled trial which used home blood pressure telemonitoring and pharmacist case management to achieve better blood pressure control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
Methods: A prospective analysis compared differences in medical costs and encounters in the Hyperlink telemonitoring intervention and usual care groups in the 12 months pre- and post-enrollment using medical and pharmacy insurance claims from a health care sector perspective. Generalized estimating equation models were used to estimate differences between groups over time. These results, combined with previously published prospective study results on intervention costs and blood pressure outcomes, were used to estimate cost-effectiveness measures for blood pressure control and reduction.
Findings: Total medical costs in the intervention group were lower compared with the usual care group by an average of \$281 per person, but this difference was not statistically significant. Clinic-based office visit, radiology, pharmacy, and hospital costs were also non-significantly lower in the intervention group. Statistically significant differences were found in lipid-related laboratory costs (higher) and in hypertension- (higher) and lipid-related (lower) pharmacy costs. Patterns in medical costs were similar for medical encounters. On average, the intervention cost \$7337 per person achieving hypertension control and \$139 or \$265 per mm Hg reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, respectively.
Conclusions: Home blood pressure monitoring and pharmacist case management to improve hypertension care can be implemented without increasing, and potentially reducing, overall medical care costs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if self-monitoring via home-based telehealth equipment could, when combined with ongoing remote monitoring by a nurse, reduce the incidence of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) presentations for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was used to compare the outcomes for participants receiving the telehealth equipment and monitoring with those for participants in an information-only control group, over a period of 6 months. Participants receiving the telehealth intervention were taught to measure and record their vital signs (blood pressure, weight, temperature, pulse, and oxygen saturation levels) on a daily basis. These were then transmitted automatically via telephone to a secure Web site where they were monitored each day by the telehealth nurse.
RESULTS: The telehealth group had fewer ED presentations and hospital admissions and a reduced length of stay in comparison with the control group. These results were not statistically significant. However, the reduction in health service use was large enough to result in significant cost savings, with the annual cost savings of the telehealth group compared with the control group being \$2,931 per person.
CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth monitoring of patient vital signs reduced health service utilization for individuals with COPD and resulted in significant cost savings. In terms of individual health benefits, improvements in participants' self-management behaviors and control over their condition was evident.},

This has been driven partly by the overcautious approach to linking quality of data to the extent of monitoring and SDV and partly by being on the safer side of regulations. The regulations however, do not state any upper or lower limits of SDV. What it expects from researchers and the sponsors is methodologies which ensure data quality. How the industry does it is open to innovation and application of statistical methods, targeted and remote monitoring, real time reporting, adaptive monitoring schedules, etc. In short, hybrid approaches to monitoring. Coupled with concepts of optimum monitoring and SDV at site and off-site monitoring techniques, it should be possible to save time required to conduct SDV leading to more available time for other productive activities. Organizations stand to gain directly or indirectly from such savings, whether by diverting the funds back to the R\&D pipeline; investing more in technology infrastructure to support large trials; or simply increasing sample size of trials. Whether it also affects the work-life balance of monitors who may then need to travel with a less hectic schedule for the same level of quality and productivity can be predicted only when there is more evidence from field.},

Thus, during the last decade, we assisted to relevant progress in the medical treatment and rehabilitation techniques and devices, including the development of telemedicine for geriatric care.
AIM: To demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel tele-health-care model allowing a better management of elderly living in nursing homes.
METHODS: Fifty-nine elderly patients (19 males and 40 females; mean age 79.1 (±9.2), were randomly divided into two groups: the experimental group that performed a proper telemonitoring with a multimodal approach (including monitoring of the vital signs and neurological/psychological counseling), and the control group, which underwent standard in-home nursing care. Neurobehavioral symptoms and quality of life were assessed in both the groups at baseline, and after the telecare protocol's end.
RESULTS: The experimental group had a statistically significant reduction in Geriatric Depression Scale (p {\textless} 0.01) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (p {\textless} 0.05) scores, and an improvement in their quality of life. Moreover, mean blood pressure and heart rate were lower in the experimental than in the control group (p {\textless} 0.05), and admission to health care services was higher in the control than in the experimental group (p {\textless} 0.05).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The combination of eHealth applications and/or services with cloud technology provides health care staff—with sufficient mobility and accessibility for them—to be able to transparently check any data they may need without having to worry about its physical location.
OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this paper is to put forward secure cloud-based solutions for a range of eHealth services such as electronic health records (EHRs), telecardiology, teleconsultation, and telediagnosis.
METHODS: The scenario chosen for introducing the services is a set of four rural health centers located within the same Spanish region. iCanCloud software was used to perform simulations in the proposed scenario. We chose online traffic and the cost per unit in terms of time as the parameters for choosing the secure solution on the most optimum cloud for each service.
RESULTS: We suggest that load balancers always be fitted for all solutions in communication together with several Internet service providers and that smartcards be used to maintain identity to an appropriate extent. The solutions offered via private cloud for EHRs, teleconsultation, and telediagnosis services require a volume of online traffic calculated at being able to reach 2 Gbps per consultation. This may entail an average cost of €500/month.
CONCLUSIONS: The security solutions put forward for each eHealth service constitute an attempt to centralize all information on the cloud, thus offering greater accessibility to medical information in the case of EHRs alongside more reliable diagnoses and treatment for telecardiology, telediagnosis, and teleconsultation services. Therefore, better health care for the rural patient can be obtained at a reasonable cost.},

The main objective of this article is to present a secure, cloud-based solution for a telecardiology service in different scenarios: a hospital, a health center in a city, and a group of health centers in a rural area.
METHODS: iCanCloud software is used to simulate the scenarios. The first scenario will be a city hospital with over 220,000 patients at its emergency services, and ∼1 million outpatient consultations. For the health center in a city, it serves ∼107,000 medical consultations and 16,700 pediatric consultations/year. In the last scenario, a group of health centers in a rural area serve an average 437.08 consultations/month and around 15.6 a day.
RESULTS: Each one of the solutions proposed shares common features including the following: secure authentication through smart cards, the use of StorageGRID technology, and load balancers. For all cases, the cloud is private and the estimated price of the solution would cost around 450 €/month.
CONCLUSIONS: Thanks to the research conducted in this work, it has been possible to provide an adapted solution in the form of a telecardiology service for a hospital, city health center, and rural health centers that offer security, privacy, and robustness, and is also optimum for a large number of cloud requests.},

The advantage of remote monitoring appears obvious in impending CIED failures and suspected symptoms but is less likely in routine follow-up of CIED.

For this reason, alternative ways to provide behavioural treatment for chronic drooling need to be explored. In a pair of case studies, the feasibility and potential of an outpatient variant of a behavioural treatment programme for drooling based on self-management strategies was researched with two children with oral motor difficulties. In a three week programme, these children were taught to perform a self-management routine in order to achieve saliva control during regular visits to the child rehabilitation centre. In addition, their parents and teachers were taught to prompt the self-management routine and instructed to provide additional practice at home and at school. In doing so, they were offered support by means of telehealth and personal contact. At the end of the treatment programme, both children showed a significant decrease in drooling severity. Their parents and teachers were satisfied with the treatment effect. Although the present treatment programme showed promising results, further adaptions are necessary to make the treatment programme more widely accessible.},

Over a period of three years, we conducted interviews with the project team and the users about the workability of the system and its integration in practice. Beside the interviews, we analyzed record data to measure the quality of the images. We compared the qualitative accounts with these measurements.
RESULTS: According to our measurements, the quality of the images was at least satisfactory in 90\% of the cases, i.e. the images could be used to screen the patients--reducing the workload of the ophthalmologist considerably. However, both the ophthalmologist and the optometrists became increasingly dissatisfied respectively with the perceived quality of the pictures and the perceived workload.Through a detailed analysis of how the professionals discussed the quality of the pictures, we re-constructed how the notion of quality of the images and being a good professional were constructed and linked. The IT system transformed into a quality system and, at the same time, transformed the notions of being a good professional. While a continuous dialogue about the quality of the pictures became an emblem for the quality of care, this dialogue was hindered by the system and the way the care process was structured.
CONCLUSION: To conceptualize what telemedicine does in interdisciplinary work practices, a fine-tuned analysis is needed to assess how IT systems re-shape the social relations between professional groups. Such transformations should not be exclusively attributed to the technology itself or to the professionals working with it. Instead we need to assess these technologies through an empirically grounded study of the sociotechnical functioning of telemedicine.},

Yes, there is the government-supported electronic medical record, which is here to stay (until our electrical and/or wired network fails). Yes, there is new technology, including robotic surgery and telemedicine and efforts to link these to our cell phones and applications, making care and expertise more available across long distances. And yes, there exist goals to extend care beyond the physician to other health care professions as the buffer between the physician and the patient, sometimes to reduce cost and sometimes to make care more ubiquitous. However, an Internet search will show that most say that the only constant in healthcare is change. I propose that the ultimate constant in healthcare is the physician-patient relationship.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12874-016-0175-6},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Action research (AR) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are usually considered to be theoretically and practically incompatible. However, we argue that their respective strengths and weaknesses can be complementary. We illustrate our argument from a recent study assessing the effect of telemonitoring on health-related quality of life, self-care, hospital use, costs and the experiences of patients, informal carers and health care professionals in two urban hospital services and one remote rural primary care service in New Zealand.
METHODS: Data came from authors' observations and field notes of discussions with three groups: the healthcare providers and healthcare consumers who participated in the research, and a group of 17 researchers and collaborators. The consumers had heart failure (Site A, urban), airways disease (Site B, urban), and diabetes (Site C, rural). The research ran from 2008 (project inception) until 2012 (project close-off). Researchers came from a wide range of disciplines. Both RCT and AR methods were recognised from early in the process but often worked in parallel rather than together. In retrospect, we have mapped our observed research processes to the AR cycle characteristics (creation of communicative space, democracy and participation, iterative learning and improvement, emergence, and accommodation of different ways of knowing).
RESULTS: We describe the context, conduct and outcomes of the telemonitoring trial, framing the overall process in the language of AR. Although not fully articulated at the time, AR processes made the RCT sensitive to important context, e.g. clinical processes. They resulted in substantive changes to the design and conduct of the RCT, and to interpretation and uptake of findings, e.g. a simpler technology procurement process emerged. Creating a communicative space enabled co-design between the researcher group and collaborators from the provider participant group, and a stronger RCT design.
CONCLUSIONS: It appears possible to enhance the utility of RCTs by explicitly embedding them in an AR framework to shape stronger RCT design. The AR process and characteristics may enable researchers to evaluate telehealth while enhancing rather than compromising the quality of an RCT, where research results are returned to practice as part of the research process.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs) may improve the quality of care, reduce access barriers, and help control medical costs. Despite the role of primary care clinicians as potential key users of RMTs, few studies explore their views. This study explores rural primary care clinician interest and the resources necessary to incorporate RMTs into routine practice.
METHODS: We conducted 15 in-depth interviews with rural primary care clinician members of the Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network (ORPRN) from November 2011 to April 2012. Our multidisciplinary team used thematic analysis to identify emergent themes and a cross-case comparative analysis to explore variation by participant and practice characteristics.
RESULTS: Clinicians expressed interest in RMTs most relevant to their clinical practice, such as supporting chronic disease management, noting benefits to patients of all ages. They expressed concern about the quantity of data, patient motivation to utilize equipment, and potential changes to the patient-clinician encounter. Direct data transfer into the clinic's electronic health record (EHR), availability in multiple formats, and review by ancillary staff could facilitate implementation. Although participants acknowledged the potential system-level benefits of using RMTs, adoption would be difficult without payment reform.
CONCLUSIONS: Adoption of RMTs by rural primary care clinicians may be influenced by equipment purpose and functionality, implementation resources, and payment. Clinician and staff engagement will be critical to actualize RMT use in routine primary care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delivery of specialty healthcare to rural citizens in the United States remains largely unmet. The Veterans Health Administration is in a unique position to deliver specialty care to rural Veterans because it is mandated to deliver medical care to all eligible Veterans regardless of residence. To accomplish this, the VHA developed large national telehealth networks that provided over 1 million episodes of care in 2012. We investigated whether clinical video telehealth technologies can provide quality efficient neurologic follow-up care to Veterans living in the rural southwest United States.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Veterans with chronic neurologic conditions living remotely in New Mexico, southern Colorado, eastern Arizona, and western Texas were offered follow-up teleneurology care at 11 rural community-based outpatient clinics following initial evaluation at the Albuquerque, NM, neurology outpatient clinic.
RESULTS: Over a 2-year period, 87\% of 354 consecutive patients returned a performance improvement satisfaction questionnaire. Ninety percent of the patients were fully satisfied with their visit, and 92\% felt teleneurology saved them time and money. We calculated an average time savings of 5 h and 325 miles driven, plus at least \$48,000 total cost savings. Ninety-five percent reported they wanted to continue their neurologic care by teleneurology.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms earlier pilot studies of successful follow-up care through telemedicine. Our patients were highly satisfied with the convenience and quality of their teleneurology visit, and the neurology providers were convinced that neurologic care to both teleneurology and clinic follow-up patients was equivalent. Teleneurology to rural Veterans can provide quality neurologic care and overwhelming patient satisfaction and save considerable time and money.},

INTRODUCTION: The Veterans Administration (VA) developed a large national telehealth network to address 5.2 million rural veterans. New Mexico's Albuquerque VA Neurology Service developed a teleneurology program for their rural veterans. This article analyzes our first 1,100 teleneurology patient visits.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Veterans living in remote areas of New Mexico, southern Colorado, eastern Arizona, and western Texas were offered follow-up teleneurology care at 16 rural VA community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) following an initial evaluation at the Albuquerque VA neurology outpatient clinic. Surveys were sent after all teleneurology visits focused on quality of care, ease of communication, satisfaction, and staff's ability to deliver same quality care as in person. Problems encountered, differences between face-to-face clinics and teleneurology, and cost savings were examined.
RESULTS: Regarding the 701 (64\%) returned surveys, we found 90\% perceived they received good care, 91\% felt there was good communication, 88\% liked the convenience, and 87\% reported they desired to continue teleneurology care. Ninety-six percent reported saving time, money, or both through CBOC visits instead of driving to Albuquerque.
DISCUSSION: All providers felt that they could deliver excellent care through teleneurology. We found emergency room visits for neurologic problems was similar for both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our rural veteran patients and neurology staff overwhelmingly found high quality patient care can be delivered via teleneurology for a variety of chronic neurologic problems and was comparable to care delivered in neurology face-to-face clinics.},

	abstract = {Intensivist physician involvement has been shown to improve outcomes for critically ill patients. Unfortunately, the number of Intensivists nationally is unable to meet the current demand. Similar to the civilian community, the Navy critical care workforce is limited by available resources. Tele-critical care (TCC) has recently been shown to improve outcomes for critically ill patients, and has been suggested as a suitable means of extending Intensivist expertise. Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton (NHCP) is a small community hospital located 41 miles north of Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD). NHCP operates a relatively low-volume six-bed medical-surgical intensive care unit. The Intensivist staffing of NHCP has been variable, ranging from 3 Intensivists to periods of time with no on-site Intensivists. This intermittent staffing has led to (1) network disengagements, (2) unnecessary transfers to NMCSD, and (3) adverse outcomes for critically ill patients cared for at NHCP without Intensivist involvement. In early 2014, NMCSD established a TCC system to address this staffing challenge. Through the TCC program, the tele-Intensivist at NMCSD provides 24/7 coverage for patients located at NHCP using low-cost, off-the-shelf, synchronous high-definition video-teleconferencing equipment, and remote access to electronic medical record, imaging studies, and laboratory data. The tele-Intensivist also participates in multidisciplinary teaching rounds with the NHCP house staff. Several medical protocols have also been developed and implemented as part of the TCC program. When comparing the 12 months before implementation with the 19 months following implementation, we found (1) a trend toward increase volume of admissions per month (22.9 ± 7.5 vs. 27 ± 6.6, p = 0.11), (2) a decrease in total number of avoidable disengagements (12 ± 0.9 vs. 0, p = 0.0008), (3) increased maximum Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score per month (17.22 ± 2.2 vs. 21.8 ± 5.5, p = 0.018), and no adverse outcomes related to the TCC system. This reduction in disengagements correlated with a savings in out-of-network expenditures of \$1.3 million over the 19 months of program operation. There was no change in either the patients' length of stay or the number of patients transferred to NMCSD. TCC improves readiness by increasing the volume and acuity of critical care patient encounters at the spoke hospital. TCC can also enhance Graduate Medical Education by providing Intensivist teaching, and supports the concept of "Regionalized Care" by improving the integration of care between hospitals. The quality of care is improved through the more rapid transfer of patients who require a higher level of care, standardization of care through protocols, and the Intensivist expertise that is applied to patients kept at the smaller facility. The value of care increased through both enhanced quality, and the cost savings associated with decreasing network disengagements. Leveraging new technology to provide remote care for our sickest beneficiaries has been proven a successful solution to the dilemma of limited Intensivist staffing. Leadership should consider TCC as a tool to extend Intensivist expertise to all of our small hospitals, and should explore the application of synchronous telehealth within the operational environment where similar staffing challenges exist.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF) are chronic diseases that impart significant health and care costs to the patient and health system. Limited access to health services affects disease severity and functional status. Telemonitoring has shown promise in reducing acute care utilization for chronic disease patients, but the benefit for the underserved has not been determined. We evaluated acute care utilization outcomes following an acute event of a 90-day transitional care program integrating telemonitoring technology and home visits for underserved COPD and HF patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were enrolled into the program between October 2010 and August 2012. Primary outcomes included rates of emergency department (ED) visits and all-cause re-admission at 30, 90, and 180 days postdischarge. Program and functional status at enrollment and discharge and satisfaction with telemonitoring at discharge were measured. Telemonitoring included daily symptomatology recording and was removed at 90 days. A control cohort was identified through electronic health records and propensity-matched via 15 variables to achieve a sample size with balanced baseline characteristics.
RESULTS: Program patients showed 50\% reduction in 30-day re-admission and 13-19\% reduction in 180-day re-admission compared with control patients. There was no significant difference in ED utilization. Patients were satisfied with telemonitoring services, and functional status improved by program end.
CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study suggests telemonitoring in the context of a transitional care model following an acute event may reduce all-cause 30-day re-admissions by up to 50\% and has the potential to reduce long-term acute care utilization and thus care costs. More rigorous and long-term investigation is warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few telemedicine programs have undergone cost analyses, impeding their implementation into practice. We report on the economic analysis of a nurse-administered intervention designed to improve blood pressure control among hypertensive veterans.
METHODS: We randomized hypertensive patients at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center primary care clinic to behavioral (n = 294) or nonbehavioral (n = 294) interventions. Behavioral intervention patients received tailored information bimonthly for 2 years via telephone. To calculate intervention cost, we microcosted the nurse's labor cost and computer hardware and software costs, applied a direct-to-indirect cost ratio, and distributed the costs over an estimated cohort of patients. We analyzed data from the Veterans Affairs Decision Support System to assess whether the intervention impacted overall health care utilization and costs. We used life expectancy estimates from the literature to develop decision models to calculate cost per life-year saved.
RESULTS: The mean annual intervention cost was \$112 (range \$61-\$259). During 2 years of follow-up, patients in the intervention group incurred \$7,800 in inpatient costs and \$9,741 in outpatient costs; the nonintervention group incurred \$6,866 in inpatient costs and \$9,599 in outpatient costs. The total cost difference was not statistically significant (P = .56). Cost-effectiveness of the behavioral intervention ranged from \$42,457 per life-year saved for normal-weight women to \$87,300 per life-year saved for normal-weight men.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that a nurse-administered, tailored behavioral intervention can be implemented at nominal cost and be cost-effective; however, there was no apparent lowering of health care utilization and costs during the 2 years of follow-up.},

	abstract = {Importance: The costs and utility of teledermatology are important features of implementation. Such an analysis requires a description of the perspective of the entity that will bear the cost.
Objective: To assess the costs and utility of a store-and-forward teledermatology referral process compared with a conventional referral process from the perspectives of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and society.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Three hundred ninety-one randomized participants were referred from remote sites of primary care to the dermatology services of 2 VA medical facilities for ambulatory skin conditions from December 2008 through June 2010, and follow-up was completed in March 2011. The time trade-off utility measures and costs were collected during a 9-month period among participants in a 2-site parallel group randomized clinical trial. The perspectives of the VA and society were evaluated. The multiple imputation procedure or weighted means were used for missing data elements. Data were analyzed from January to July 2014.
Interventions: Referrals were managed using store-and-forward teledermatology or a conventional text-based referral process.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Total costs from the perspectives of the VA and society incurred during the 9-month follow-up were used to derive per-participant costs. Utility, using the time trade-off method, was the measure of effectiveness.
Results: From the VA perspective, the total cost for conventional referrals was \$66 145 (minimum, \$58 697; maximum, \$71 635), or \$338 (SD, \$291) per participant (196 participants); the total cost for teledermatology referrals was \$59 917 (mimimum, \$51 794; maximum, \$70 398), or \$308 (SD, \$298) per participant (195 participants). The \$30 difference in per-participant cost was not statistically significant (95\% CI, -\$79 to \$20). From the societal perspective, the total cost for conventional referrals was \$106 194 (minimum, \$98 746; maximum, \$111 684), or \$542 (SD, \$403) per participant (196 participants); the total cost for teledermatology referrals was \$89 523 (minimum, \$81 400; maximum, \$100 400) or \$460 (SD, \$428) per participant. This \$82 difference in per-participant cost was statistically significant (95\% CI, -\$12 to -\$152). From baseline to the 9-month follow-up, the time trade-off utility value improved by 0.02 in the conventional referral group and 0.03 in the teledermatology group. This difference was not statistically significant (P = .50).
Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with conventional referrals, store-and-forward teledermatology referrals were performed at a comparable cost (VA perspective) or at a lower cost (societal perspective) with no evidence of a difference in utility as measured by the time trade-off method.

	abstract = {Globally, new cancer cases will rise by 57\% within the next two decades, with the majority in the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Consequently, a steep increase of about 40\% in cancer deaths is expected there, mainly because of lack of treatment facilities, especially radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is required for more than 50\% of patients, but the capital cost for equipment often deters establishment of such facilities in LMICs. Presently, of the 139 LMICs, 55 do not even have a radiotherapy facility, whereas the remaining 84 have a deficit of 61.4\% of their required radiotherapy units. Networking between centers could enhance the effectiveness and reach of existing radiotherapy in LMICs. A teleradiotherapy network could enable centers to share and optimally utilize their resources, both infrastructure and staffing. This could be in the form of a three-tier radiotherapy service consisting of primary, secondary, and tertiary radiotherapy centers interlinked through a network. The concept has been adopted in some LMICs and could also be used as a "service provider model," thereby reducing the investments to set up such a network. Teleradiotherapy networks could be a part of the multipronged approach to address the enormous gap in radiotherapy services in a cost-effective manner and to support better accessibility to radiotherapy facilities, especially for LMICs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The application of telemedicine has been described for its use in medical training and education, management of stroke patients, urologic surgeries, pediatric laparoscopic surgeries, clinical outreach, and the field of orthopedics. However, the usefulness of a secure, mobile telehealth application, and messaging platform has not been well described.
OBJECTIVE: A pilot study was conducted to implement a health insurance portability and accountability act (HIPAA) compliant form of communication between doctors in an orthopedic clinical setting and determine their reactions to MyDoc, a secure, mobile telehealth application, and messaging platform.
METHODS: By replacing current methods of communication through various mobile applications and text messaging services with MyDoc over a six week period, we gained feedback and determined user satisfaction with this innovative system from questionnaires handed to the program director, program coordinator, one trauma consultant, all orthopedic residents, and six non-orthopedic residents at the National University Hospital in Singapore.
RESULTS: Almost everyone who completed the questionnaire strongly agreed that MyDoc should replace current systems of peer to peer communication in the hospital. The majority also felt that the quality of images, videos, and sound were excellent. Almost everyone agreed that they could communicate easily with each other and would feel comfortable doing so routinely. The majority felt that virtual consults through MyDoc should be made available to inpatients as well as outpatients to potentially lessen clinic loads and provide a secure manner in which patients can communicate with their primary teams any time convenient to both. It was also agreed by most that the potential of telerounding had advantages, especially on weekends as a supplement to normal rounds.
CONCLUSIONS: Potential uses of MyDoc in an orthopedic clinical setting include HIPAA-compliant peer to peer communication, clinical outreach in the setting of trauma, supervision in the operating room or watching procedures being performed remotely, providing both patient and parent reassurance in pediatric orthopedic patients, and finally in the setting of outpatient clinics. With our pilot study having excellent results in terms of acceptance and satisfaction, the integration of a secure, mobile telehealth application, and messaging platform, not only in the orthopedic department but also the hospital in general, has an exciting and limitless potential. More so in this era where downsizing hospital costs is beneficial, doing so may also be mandatory in order to comply with the soon to be introduced personal data protection act.},

	abstract = {Between July 2003 and December 2007, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) introduced a national home telehealth program, Care Coordination/Home Telehealth (CCHT). Its purpose was to coordinate the care of veteran patients with chronic conditions and avoid their unnecessary admission to long-term institutional care. Demographic changes in the veteran population necessitate VHA increase its noninstitutional care (NIC) services 100\% above its 2007 level to provide care for 110,000 NIC patients by 2011. By 2011, CCHT will meet 50\% of VHA's anticipated NIC provision. CCHT involves the systematic implementation of health informatics, home telehealth, and disease management technologies. It helps patients live independently at home. Between 2003 and 2007, the census figure (point prevalence) for VHA CCHT patients increased from 2,000 to 31,570 (1,500\% growth). CCHT is now a routine NIC service provided by VHA to support veteran patients with chronic conditions as they age. CCHT patients are predominantly male (95\%) and aged 65 years or older. Strict criteria determine patient eligibility for enrollment into the program and VHA internally assesses how well its CCHT programs meet standardized clinical, technology, and managerial requirements. VHA has trained 5,000 staff to provide CCHT. Routine analysis of data obtained for quality and performance purposes from a cohort of 17,025 CCHT patients shows the benefits of a 25\% reduction in numbers of bed days of care, 19\% reduction in numbers of hospital admissions, and mean satisfaction score rating of 86\% after enrolment into the program. The cost of CCHT is \$1,600 per patient per annum, substantially less than other NIC programs and nursing home care. VHA's experience is that an enterprise-wide home telehealth implementation is an appropriate and cost-effective way of managing chronic care patients in both urban and rural settings.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This retrospective analysis of 2009-2012 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) administrative data assessed the efficacy of care coordination home telehealth (CCHT), a model of care designed to reduce institutional care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Outcomes for 4,999 CCHT-non-institutional care (NIC) patients were compared with usual (non-CCHT) care in a matched cohort group (MCG) of 183,872 Veterans. Both cohorts were comprised of patients with complex chronic conditions with statistically similar baseline (pre-CCHT enrollment) healthcare costs, when adjusted for age, sex, chronic disease, emergency room (ER) visits, hospital admissions, hospital lengths of stay, and pharmacy costs.
RESULTS: Subsequent analyses after 12 months of CCHT-NIC enrollment showed mean annual healthcare costs for CCHT-NIC patients fell 4\%, from \$21,071 to \$20,206, whereas the corresponding costs for MCG patients increased 48\%, from \$20,937 to \$31,055. Higher mean annual pharmacy expenditure of 22\% (\$470 over baseline) for CCHT-NIC patients versus 15\% for MCG patients (\$326 over baseline) was attributable to the medication compliance effect of better care coordination. Several healthcare cost drivers (e.g., ER visits and admissions) had sizable declines in the CCHT-NIC group. Medicare usage review in both cohorts excluded this as a confounding factor in cost analyses. Prefinal case selection criteria analysis of both cohorts yielded a 9.8\% mortality rate in CCHT patients versus 16.58\% in non-CCHT patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study corroborates previous positive VHA analyses of CCHT but contradicts results from recent non-VHA studies, highlighting the efficacy of the VHA's standardized CCHT model, which incorporates a biopsychosocial approach to care that emphasizes patient self-management.},

In this context 'practice-centred' evaluation acts as a scalable, coordinating framework for evaluation that recognises health information technology supported care as an achievement that is contingent and ongoing. We argue that if complex programmes of technology-enabled service innovation are understood in terms of their contribution to patient care and supported by participative, capability-building evaluation methodologies, conditions are created for practitioners and patients to realise the potential of technologies and make substantive contributions to the evidence base underpinning health innovation programmes.
BACKGROUND: Electronic Patient Records (EPRs) and telemedicine are positioned by policymakers as health information technologies that are integral to achieving improved clinical outcomes and efficiency savings. However, evaluating the extent to which these aims are met poses distinct evaluation challenges, particularly where clinical and cost outcomes form the sole focus of evaluation design. We propose that a practice-centred approach to evaluation - in which those whose day-to-day care practice is altered (or not) by the introduction of new technologies are placed at the centre of evaluation efforts - can complement and in some instances offer advantages over, outcome-centric evaluation models.
METHODS: We carried out a regional programme of innovation in renal services where a participative approach was taken to the introduction of new technologies, including: a regional EPR system and a system to support video clinics. An 'action learning' approach was taken to procurement, pre-implementation planning, implementation, ongoing development and evaluation. Participants included clinicians, technology specialists, patients and external academic researchers. Whilst undergoing these activities we asked: how can a practice-centred approach be embedded into evaluation of health information technologies?
DISCUSSION: Organising EPR and telemedicine evaluation around predetermined outcome measures alone can be impractical given the complex and contingent nature of such projects. It also limits the extent to which unforeseen outcomes and new capabilities are recognised. Such evaluations often fail to improve understanding of 'when' and 'under what conditions' technology-enabled service improvements are realised, and crucially, how such innovation improves care.
SUMMARY: Our contribution, drawn from our experience of the case study provided, is a protocol for practice-centred, participative evaluation of technology in the clinical setting that privileges care. In this context 'practice-centred' evaluation acts as a scalable, coordinating framework for evaluation that recognises health information technology supported care as an achievement that is contingent and ongoing. We argue that if complex programmes of technology-enabled service innovation are understood in terms of their contribution to patient care and supported by participative, capability-building evaluation methodologies, conditions are created for practitioners and patients to realise the potential of technologies and make substantive contributions to the evidence base underpinning health innovation programmes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neurosurgery is a highly specialized service that, because of high costs, is often centralized. Since 2005, a neurosurgical telecounseling service was defined and then deployed in the Veneto Region. It was aimed at creating the same range of services for head trauma by using standardized protocols at regional levels and at rationalizing the use of human and technological resources by providing a network of services that manages patients at the local level. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the use of this service.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Interoperability and flexibility were granted by creating a technological framework based on international standards. Physicians of local hospitals electronically transmit patients' clinical data and images to neurosurgeons located at a central hospital. These physicians respond to the requesting physicians by providing all the necessary recommendations.
RESULTS: The outcomes were collected over a period of 41 months. The service is now available in 34 hospitals. Every year 3,181 telecounselings are conducted for patients with an average age of 65.5 years (55\% male, 45\% female) whose health status is mainly not serious. Within 30 min from the request of telecounseling, 49\% of responses are sent. In 84\% of cases the patient was not moved. The overall appreciation of clinicians is positive (4.3/5). Intervention time was reduced, and resources were optimized.
CONCLUSIONS: The service brought remarkable benefits at the organizational level. The reorganization of the processes and patient management leads to rationalization of both human and technological resources.},

Telemonitoring can identify worsening heart failure but previous randomized trials have enrolled selected patient populations. The Home-HF study examined the impact of home telemonitoring on typical heart failure patients discharged from three acute hospitals in North West London, UK.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients hospitalized with heart failure were randomized to telemonitoring or usual specialist care. Primary outcome measures were days alive and out of hospital. Secondary outcome measures were number and duration of heart failure hospitalizations, clinic visits, and quality of life. We recruited 182 patients. There was no difference in the primary outcome measure in the two groups, but there were significantly fewer unplanned hospitalizations for heart failure decompensation, and a reduction in clinic and emergency room visits in the telemonitoring group. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean direct health service costs.
CONCLUSION: Home telemonitoring in a typical elderly population of heart failure patients produces a similar outcome to 'usual' specialist care, but reduces clinic and emergency room visits and unplanned heart failure rehospitalizations at little additional cost. This method of disease monitoring may allow specialist services to increase the number of patients under their care.},

Mo̅tiv8 Systems, an Internet-based remote monitoring platform, was used to collect video-recorded breath carbon monoxide (CO) samples. All team members could communicate with each other via an online discussion forum. During baseline conditions, only 3.3\% of CO samples were negative for smoking, which suggests that self-monitoring and access to the online discussion forum were insufficient to initiate abstinence. When the group contingencies were instituted 41.3\% of CO samples were negative. There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 arrangements in the percentage of negative CO samples or point prevalence at the end of treatment or at the 3-month follow-up. Participants posted an average of 25 comments on the discussion forum, most of which were rated as positive by independent observers. The mean cost of vouchers per participant was lower in the full group (\$33) relative to the mixed group (\$190).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy of wide-field digital retinal imaging for retinopathy of prematurity screening.
DESIGN: Retrospective study in a quaternary public neonatal intensive care unit.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 108 premature infants screened for retinopathy of prematurity.
METHODS: Retrospective chart and photo review were performed on participants screened by both serial wide-field digital retinal imaging and concurrent binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. Review of captured digital photos was performed independently by a masked reader. Using the binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy findings as the gold standard, the efficacy of wide-field digital retinal imaging in detecting treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity, defined as type 1 prethreshold disease, was determined.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity of wide-field digital retinal imaging in detecting treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity.
RESULTS: Treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity was detected in 11 infants by both binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy examination and telemedicine images taken at the same visit. Wide-field digital retinal imaging has a sensitivity of 100\% (95\% CI: 76.2-100\%) and a specificity of 97.9\% (95\% CI: 93.4-99.7\%) in detecting infants with treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity. Positive and negative predictive values of wide-field digital retinal imaging were 84.6\% (95\% CI: 57.8-97.3\%) and 100\% (95\% CI: 96.9-100\%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Wide-field digital retinal imaging is accurate, reliable and efficient in detecting treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity. Incorporating wide-field digital retinal imaging with telemedicine in standard retinopathy of prematurity management can potentially improve delivery, accessibility, quality and cost of retinopathy of prematurity care.},

Individuals experiencing impairment due to depressive symptomatology are most likely to report their symptoms to a primary care provider. As such, national guidelines highlight the need to assess and effectively treat depression via primary care. Despite these guidelines, the dissemination of evidence-based psychotherapy via primary care is limited, likely due to both provider- and patient-level treatment barriers. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies are promising for addressing these barriers and for promoting uptake of evidence-based depression treatment. Among evidence-based psychotherapies for depression, brief Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD) has shown great promise and is particularly amenable to mHealth delivery. Herein, we discuss the development of a BATD mobile application, Moodivate, that was developed in order to disseminate BATD via primary care. This paper focuses on description of (1) rationale for Moodivate treatment development, (2) Moodivate treatment components, (3) ongoing clinical trial evaluation of Moodivate, and (4) clinical considerations for incorporating Moodivate into clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Changes in thoracoabdominal motion are highly prevalent in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Home care services that use telemedicine techniques and Internet-based monitoring have the potential to improve the management of these patients. However, there is no detailed description in the literature of a system for Internet-based monitoring of patients with disturbed thoracoabdominal motion. The purpose of this work was to describe the development of a new telemedicine instrument for Internet-based home monitoring of thoracoabdominal movement. The instrument directly measures changes in the thorax and abdomen circumferences and transfers data through a transmission control protocol∕Internet protocol connection. After the design details are described, the accuracy of the electronic and software processing units of the instrument is evaluated by using electronic signals simulating normal subjects and individuals with thoracoabdominal motion disorders. The results obtained during in vivo studies on normal subjects simulating thoracoabdominal motion disorders showed that this new system is able to detect a reduction in abdominal movement that is associated with abnormal thoracic breathing (p {\textless} 0.0001) and the reduction in thoracic movement during abnormal abdominal breathing (p {\textless} 0.005). Simulated asynchrony in thoracoabdominal motion was also adequately detected by the system (p {\textless} 0.0001). The experimental results obtained for patients with respiratory diseases were in close agreement with the expected values, providing evidence that this instrument can be a useful tool for the evaluation of thoracoabdominal motion. The Internet transmission tests showed that the acquisition and analysis of the thoracoabdominal motion signals can be performed remotely. The user can also receive medical recommendations. The proposed system can be used in a spectrum of telemedicine scenarios, which can reduce the costs of assistance offered to patients with respiratory diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a frequently occurring, often disabling symptom in MS with no single effective treatment. In current fatigue management interventions, personalized, real-time follow-up is often lacking. The objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of the MS TeleCoach, a novel intervention offering telemonitoring of fatigue and telecoaching of physical activity and energy management in persons with MS (pwMS) over a 12-week period. The goal of the MS TeleCoach, conceived as a combination of monitoring, self-management and motivational messages, is to enhance levels of physical activity thereby improving fatigue in pwMS in an accessible and interactive way, reinforcing self-management of patients.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective, open-label feasibility study of the MS TeleCoach in pwMS with Expanded Disability Status Scale ≤ 4 and moderate to severe fatigue as measured by the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC). Following a 2-week run-in period to assess the baseline activity level per patient, the target number of activity counts was gradually increased over the 12-week period through telecoaching. The primary efficacy outcome was change in FSMC total score from baseline to study end. A subset of patients was asked to fill in D-QUEST 2.0, a usability questionnaire, to evaluate the satisfaction with the MS TeleCoach device and the experienced service.
RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were recruited from 16 centres in Belgium, of which 57 patients (76\%) completed the study. FSMC total score (p = 0.009) and motor and cognitive subscores (p = 0.007 and p = 0.02 respectively) decreased from baseline to week 12, indicating an improvement in fatigue. One third of participants with severe fatigue changed to a lower FSMC category for both FSMC total score and subscores. The post-study evaluation of patient satisfaction showed that the intervention was well accepted and that patients were very satisfied with the quality of the professional services.
CONCLUSION: Using MS TeleCoach as a self-management tool in pwMS suffering from mild disability and moderate to severe fatigue appeared to be feasible, both technically and from a content perspective. Its use was associated with improved fatigue levels in the participants who completed the study. The MS Telecoach seems to meet the need for a low-cost, accessible and interactive self-management tool in MS.},

The lack of clarity about the value of telehealth implementations has been one reason cited for this slow adoption. The Center for Information Technology Leadership has examined the value of telehealth encounters in which there is a provider both with the patient and at a distance from the patient. We considered three models of telehealth: store-and-forward, real-time video and hybrid systems. Evidence from the literature was extrapolated using a simulation, which found that the hybrid model was the most cost-effective of the three. The simulation predicted savings of \$4.3 billion per year if hybrid telehealth systems were to be implemented in emergency rooms, prisons, nursing home facilities and physician offices across the US. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine which factors most affected costs and savings. For all three telehealth models, the highest sensitivities were to the cost of a face-to-face visit, the cost of a telehealth visit and the success rate of a telehealth visit, i.e. the proportion of telehealth visits that avoided the need for a face-to-face visit. Payers, providers and policy-makers should work together to remove the barriers to the adoption of telehealth in order to make it widely available to all.},

	abstract = {Introduction Treatment adjustments in Parkinson's disease (PD) are in part dependent on motor assessments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of home-based motor monitoring plus standard in-office visits versus in-office visits alone in patients with advanced PD. Methods The procedures consisted of a prospective, one-year follow-up, randomized, case-control study. A total of 40 patients with advanced PD were randomized into two groups: 20 patients underwent home-based motor monitoring by using wireless motion sensor technology, while the other 20 patients had in-office visits. Motor and non-motor symptom severities, quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and comorbidities were assessed every four months. Direct costs were assessed using a standardized questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results Both groups of PD patients were largely comparable in their clinical and demographic variables at baseline; however, there were more participants using levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel in the home-based motor monitoring group. There was a trend for lower Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale functional status (UPDRS II) scores in the patients monitored at home compared to the standard clinical follow-up ( p = 0.06). However, UPDRS parts I, III, IV and quality-adjusted life-years scores were similar between both groups. Home-based motor monitoring was cost-effective in terms of improvement of functional status, motor severity, and motor complications (UPDRS II, III; IV subscales), with an ICER/UPDRS ranging from €126.72 to €701.31, respectively. Discussion Home-based motor monitoring is a tool which collects cost-effective clinical information and helps augment health care for patients with advanced PD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home tele-monitoring (HTM) is used to monitor the clinical signs and symptoms of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) in order to reduce unplanned hospital admissions. However, not all patients who are referred will agree to use HTM, and some patients choose to withdraw early from its use.
AIMS: ADaPT-HF will investigate whether depression, anxiety, low perceived control, reduced technology capability, level of education, age or the severity or complexity of a patient's illness can predict refusal of, or early withdrawal from, HTM in patients with CHF.
METHODS: The study will recruit 288 patients who have been recently admitted to hospital with heart failure who have been referred for HTM. At the time of referral, patients will complete depression (nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety (seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder questionnaire), perceived control (eight-item revised Controlled Attitudes Scale) and technology capability (ten-item Technology Readiness Index 2.0) screening questionnaires. In addition, data on demographics, diagnosis, clinical examination, socio-economic status, history of comorbidities, medication, biochemistry and haematology will be recorded. The primary outcome will be a composite of refusal of or early withdrawal from HTM. The principle analysis will be made using logistic regression.
CONCLUSION: By establishing which factors influence a patient's decision to refuse or withdraw early from HTM, it may be possible to redesign HTM referral processes. It may be that patients with CHF who also have depression, anxiety, low control and poor technology skills should not be referred until they receive appropriate support or that they should be managed differently when they do receive HTM. The results of ADAPT-HF may provide a way of making more efficient and cost-effective use of HTM services.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12911-018-0647-1},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traumatic injury is a serious global health burden, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where medical care often lacks resources and expertise. In these contexts, diagnostic telemedicine could prove a cost effective tool, yet it remains largely underused here, and knowledge on its potential impact is limited. Particularly scarce is the view of the expert user physicians, and how they themselves relate to this technology.
METHODS: This qualitative study investigated tele-experts' (n = 15) views on the potential for image based teleconsultation to be integrated in trauma and emergency care services. A semi-structured interview guide was used to gather data concerning an mHealth app for burns diagnostics in the acute care setting, in the Western Cape, South Africa. Questions examined challenges and opportunities in user acceptance and outcomes, in specific case management and in the wider healthcare system. Resulting data were subject to qualitative content analysis.
RESULTS: Experts perceived remote diagnostic support through mHealth as linking directly to several key ideas in medicine, including barriers to care, medical culture and hierarchy, and medical ethics within a society. Ideas running through the data pertained to the widening and narrowing of inherent gaps in the healthcare system, and the formalisation of processes, practices and relationships, effected by the introduction of an app. Wide consensus was stated on positive outcomes such as increased education opportunities, improved professional relationships and a better ability to advise and diagnose, all further facilitated through greater ease of access. The belief was that these could achieve a narrowing of systemic divides within healthcare, although it was acknowledged that the possibility to induce the opposite effect also arose. Differing opinions were voiced relating to the involvement of allied health professionals and feedback.
CONCLUSION: Experts see several aspects to an mHealth app for remote diagnostic support which could enhance provision of trauma and emergency care in a resource poor setting, relating to reduced delays, streamlined care and improved outcomes. Attention is also drawn, however, to specifics of the environment which would demand further and careful consideration for success - time pressure, intensity and the wide range of subspecialties to be considered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite recognition of the benefits associated with well-controlled diabetes and hypertension, control remains suboptimal. Effective interventions for these conditions have been studied within academic settings, but interventions targeting both conditions have rarely been tested in community settings. We describe the design and baseline results of a trial evaluating a behavioral intervention among community patients with poorly-controlled diabetes and comorbid hypertension.
METHODS: Tailored Case Management for Diabetes and Hypertension (TEACH-DM) is a 24-month randomized, controlled trial evaluating a telephone-delivered behavioral intervention for diabetes and hypertension versus attention control. The study recruited from nine community practices. The nurse-administered intervention targets 3 areas: 1) cultivation of healthful behaviors for diabetes and hypertension control; 2) provision of fundamentals to support attainment of healthful behaviors; and 3) identification and correction of patient-specific barriers to adopting healthful behaviors. Hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure measured at 6, 12, and 24 months are co-primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, self-reported medication adherence, exercise, and cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: Of 377 randomized patients, 193 were allocated to the intervention and 184 to attention control. The cohort is balanced in terms of gender, race, education level, and income. The cohort's mean baseline hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure are above goal, and mean baseline body mass index falls in the obese range. Baseline self-reported non-adherence is high for diabetes and hypertension medications. Trial results are pending.
CONCLUSIONS: If effective, the TEACH-DM intervention's telephone-based delivery strategy and nurse administration make it well-suited for rapid implementation and broad dissemination in community settings.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A number of effective treatments for bulimia nervosa have been developed, but they are infrequently used, in part due to problems with dissemination. The goal of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of telemedicine delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa.
METHOD: A randomized controlled trial of face-to-face versus telemedicine cognitive behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa. One hundred twenty eight women with DSM-IV bulimia nervosa or eating disorder, not otherwise specified subsyndromal variants of bulimia nervosa were randomized to 20 sessions of treatment over 16 weeks. A cost effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective was conducted.
RESULTS: The total cost per recovered (abstinent) subject was \$9324.68 for face-to-face CBT, and \$7300.40 for telemedicine CBT. The cost differential was accounted for largely by therapist travel costs. Sensitivity analyses examining therapy session costs, gasoline costs and telemedicine connection costs yielded fundamentally similar results.
DISCUSSION: In this study, CBT delivered face-to-face and via telemedicine were similarly effective, and telemedicine delivery cost substantially less. These findings underscore the potential applicability of telemedicine approaches to eating disorder treatment and psychiatric treatment in general.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nonadherence, inadequate monitoring, and side-effects result in suboptimal outcomes in ulcerative colitis (UC). We hypothesize that telemanagement for UC will improve symptoms, quality of life, adherence, and decrease costs.
PURPOSE: This article describes the challenges encountered in the design of the home telemanagement in patients with UC trial.
METHODS: In a randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of telemanagement for UC compared to best available care, 100 patients will be enrolled. Subjects in the intervention arm will complete self-testing with telemanagement weekly; best available care subjects will receive scheduled follow up, educational fact sheets, and written action plans. Telemanagement consists of a home-unit, decision support server, and web-based clinician portal. The home-unit includes a scale and laptop. Subjects will respond to questions about symptoms, side-effects, adherence, and knowledge weekly; subjects will receive action plans after self-testing. Outcome variables to be assessed every 4 months include: disease activity, using the Seo index; quality of life, using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire; adherence, using pharmacy refill data and the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale; utilization of healthcare resources, using urgent care visits and hospitalizations.
RESULTS: We encountered several challenges during design and implementation of our trial. First, we selected a randomized controlled trial design. We could have selected a quasiexperimental design to decrease the sample size needed and costs. Second, identification of a control group was challenging. Telemanagement patients received self-care plans and an educational curriculum. Since controls would not receive these interventions, we thought our results would be biased in favor of telemanagement. In addition, we wanted to evaluate the mode of delivery of these components of care. Therefore, we included written action plans and educational materials for patients in the control group ('best available care'). Third, we could not blind subjects to group assignment. In an attempt to decrease bias, staff was masked to group assignment to decrease measurement bias. Fourth, we selected outcome measures that were not invasive to decrease risks to subjects and to enhance recruitment.
LIMITATIONS: Our results may not be generalizable as our program is a tertiary center. Further, subjects are not blinded to the intervention potentially resulting in bias; we attempt to minimize this bias by having staff masked to treatment group at the time of assessment of outcome measures.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, our trial will be the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate telemedicine in subjects with gastrointestinal disease. We describe several issues encountered in design and implementation of our trial that will aid investigators when planning telemedicine trials in inflammatory bowel disease.},

More than 11 million Americans are diagnosed with COPD, with an additional 13 million people estimated to be living with undiagnosed disease. For patients diagnosed with COPD, the turning point will be hospitalization. It is important, therefore, that new treatment techniques that manage the signs and symptoms of the COPD and impact the prevalence and severity of exacerbations, hospital admissions, quality of life, and activities of daily living, and innovative clinical management strategies that optimize hospital discharge planning, all show promise in improving outcomes for patients with COPD. In particular, readmissions following COPD hospitalization are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and costs of care, and therefore hospital readmissions are receiving close scrutiny as an opportunity to improve patient care. To this end, programs to assess the presence and severity of dyspnea, and secretion burden and clearance, through implementation of a telemedicine program, use of noninvasive ventilation or supplemental oxygen, and development of a comprehensive self-management program have all been found to be variously effective as elements of a posthospitalization treatment plan.

While it is within the purview of speech-language pathologists to provide evaluation, treatment, and management of dysphagia, the number of patients with dysphagia is growing faster than the number of qualified dysphagia clinicians. Because dysphagia consultations via telepractice are feasible and relatively accessible from a technological standpoint, they offer a promising strategy to bring the expertise of distant dysphagia experts to patients in underserved areas. Tele-dysphagia management has the potential to increase patients' survival, enhance the expertise of primary, local clinicians, and reduce healthcare costs. Even a modest reduction in either hospital admissions for aspiration pneumonia, or in the length of stay for AP, could save the US health care system hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Wide spread tele-dysphagia management offers significant opportunities for prevention, cost-savings and advanced training, and is therefore worthy of consideration by stakeholders in the health care system and university training programs.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Heart failure (HF) treatment guided by physicians with access to real-time pressure measurement from a wireless implantable pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) sensor (CardioMEMS), has previously been shown to reduce HF-related hospital admissions in the CHAMPION trial. However, uncertainty remains regarding the value of CardioMEMS in European health systems where healthcare costs are significantly lower than in the USA.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PAP-guided treatment of HF using the CardioMEMS™ HF system compared with usual care. Cost-effectiveness was measured as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. In the base case analysis over a time horizon of 10 years, PAP-guided HF therapy increased cost compared with usual care by £10 916 (€14 030). QALYs per patient for usual care and PAP-guided patients were 2.57 and 3.14, respectively, reflecting an increase of 0.57 QALYs with PAP-guided treatment. The resultant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is £19 274 (€24 772) per QALY gained. The base case analysis did not include staff time, due to a lack of data concerning this variable. Running the model with estimated staff time included resulted in an increased ICER of between £22 342 and £25 464 per QALY gained (€28 709-32 721).
CONCLUSION: The analysis indicates that integrating wireless PAP monitoring into the management of UK HF patients is likely to be a cost-effective addition to the HF treatment pathway for appropriate patients.},

Microcontrollers allow for the creation of simple, inexpensive machines that receive input from one or more sensors to trigger a mechanical or electrical output. Bringing these technologies together, we have developed custom solutions that improve capabilities and reduce costs, errors, and human intervention. In this article, we describe three devices: JetLid, TipWaster, and Remote Monitoring Device (REMIND). JetLid employs a microcontroller and presence sensor to trigger a high-speed fan that reliably de-lids microtiter plates on a high-throughput screening system. TipWaster uses a presence sensor to activate an active tip waste chute when tips are ejected from a pipetting head. REMIND is a wireless, networked lab monitoring device. In its current implementation, it monitors the liquid level of waste collection vessels or bulk liquid reagent containers. The modularity of this device makes adaptation to other sensors (temperature, humidity, light/darkness, movement, etc.) relatively simple. These three devices illustrate how 3D printing and microcontrollers have enabled the process of rapidly turning ideas into useful devices.},

A possible solution could be delivery of care via telehealth. This study aims to identify current barriers in accessing healthcare services, and to determine if telehealth is an acceptable mode of healthcare delivery, from the perspective of patients with chronic musculoskeletal conditions. Methods Surveys were distributed to current patients receiving care within the Neurosurgical and Orthopaedic Physiotherapy Screening Clinic and Multidisciplinary Service (N/OPSC \& MDS) at six facilities throughout Queensland, Australia. The 48-item survey evaluated five key areas including demographics; current barriers to attendance; satisfaction with current management provided by the N/OPSC \& MDS; technology access and literacy; and attitudes and preference towards telehealth. Results In total, 85 patients (71\%) completed the survey. The majority of patients were satisfied overall with the N/OPSC \& MDS, but almost one-quarter of the patients reported ceasing treatment due to difficulty accessing services. Over half of the respondents were willing to use telehealth if it reduced the costs (53\%) and time (57\%) associated with attending appointments. Patients in paid employment were more likely (65\%) to use telehealth if it reduced work absenteeism. Overall, 78\% of patients were identified as having appropriate technology access to enable home telehealth. Specifically, 43\% of patients would prefer home telehealth over having to travel to attend their appointments. Discussion The majority of N/OPSC \& MDS patients are willing to engage in telehealth for the management of their chronic musculoskeletal condition. These findings justify consideration of telehealth as an additional method of service delivery within the existing N/OPSC \& MD service.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The use of e-mail-based telemedicine has been demonstrated as an effective and low-cost way of delivering healthcare to patients in remote areas who have limited access to medical services. We established a novel teleorthopedic service for a catchment area encompassing 972,000 km2 using a commercial off-the-shelf e-mail application. Before the implementation of this program, patients with acute orthopedic injuries were required to travel by air up to 1,900 km for evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon. In the present study, we examined the patient demographics and consultation characteristics and calculated the cost savings associated with patient travel for this teleorthopedic service.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 1,000 consecutive e-mail-based consults and radiographic images received for new patients with acute orthopedic injuries from January 2008 to June 2013. Seventy-nine consults were excluded due to incomplete documentation, leaving 921 available for analysis. The service records were examined to identify patient demographics, orthopedic diagnosis, the percentage of patients managed locally, and the medical indications for patients requiring transfer. As the travel costs for patients requiring transport to the university hospital center are borne by governmental health agencies, the savings accrued from treating patients in their home communities were also calculated.
RESULTS: For the 921 consultations, the mean age of patients was 27 years (range, 3 months-88 years), with 40.7\% of all patients being younger than 18 years. The most common diagnoses were ankle fractures (15.2\%), clavicle fractures (11.2\%), distal radius fractures (11.2\%), and fractures of the foot (10.2\%). One hundred ninety patients (20.6\%) required transfer, whereas 731 patients (79.4\%) were treated in their home communities. Of the patients who were transferred, 123 (64.7\%) required surgery, 55 (28.9\%) required clinical evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon, and 12 (6.4\%) required CT or MRI. Cost savings related to return trip travel expenses were calculated to be \$5,538,120 Canadian (CAD) for the review period.
SUMMARY: Using an e-mail-based teleorthopedic service to manage acutely injured patients in remote communities allowed 79\% of patients to be treated locally, with travel-related cost savings of \$5,538,120 CAD.},

Our aim was to evaluate the applicability of the CareLink(®) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) remote monitoring system as a complementary option to the follow-up of patients with implanted devices, between in-office visits. Evaluated outcomes included both clinical (event detection and time to diagnosis) and nonclinical (patient's satisfaction and economic costs) aspects. An observational, longitudinal, prospective study was conducted with patients from a Portuguese central hospital sampled by convenience during 1 week (43 patients). Data were collected in four moments: two in-office visits and two remote evaluations, reproducing 1 year of clinical follow-up. Data sources included health records, implant reports, initial demographic data collection, follow-up printouts, and a questionnaire. After selection criteria were verified, 15 patients (11 men [73\%]) were included, 63.4±10.8 years old, representing 14.0±6.3 implant months. Clinically, 15 events were detected (9 by remote monitoring and 6 by patient-initiated activation), of which only 9 were symptomatic. We verified that remote monitoring could detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic events, whereas patient-initiated activation only detected symptomatic ones (p=0.028). Moreover, the mean diagnosis anticipation in patients with events was approximately 58 days (p{\textless}0.001). In nonclinical terms, we observed high or very high satisfaction (67\% and 33\%, respectively) with using remote monitoring technology, but still 8 patients (53\%) stated they preferred in-office visits. Finally, the introduction of remote monitoring technology has the ability to reduce total follow-up costs for patients by 25\%. We conclude that the use of this system constitutes a viable complementary option to the follow-up of patients with implantable devices, between in-office visits.},

METHODS: A 5-year retrospective review of all cleft patients evaluated in an ambulatory setting was conducted. Patient demographics and location, number, and type of telemedicine visits were recorded. Specific treatment algorithms utilizing telemedicine for perioperative care for primary and secondary cleft lip and nasal repair, palatoplasty, and operation for velopharyngeal insufficiency are described. A cost-utility analysis was performed comparing distances between patient homes and primary hub versus telemedicine clinic sites.
RESULTS: Five hundred nineteen patients were identified; 18.1\% attended at least 1 teleconferencing visit. Postoperative follow-up was 100\%. The majority of screening, preoperative, and postoperative care was provided using telemedicine. In-person evaluations were performed when intraoral assessments were necessary. Telemedicine visits were associated with an average savings of 239 miles per visit in the United States and 578 miles per visit in Mexico.
CONCLUSIONS: Video teleconferencing can be used to provide comprehensive regional and international cleft care to facilitate initial evaluations and consistent follow-up.

The objective of the current study was to analyze a low-cost telecytopathology method for the remote assessment of thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs), with comparison of the primarily rendered adequacy and diagnosis with the final conventional analysis.
METHODS: Material collected from thyroid FNABs was immediately smeared onto glass slides and stained with Diff-Quik. A conventional microscope attached to a smart device was operated on-site by either a medical student or a pathology resident for Wi-Fi transmission of the images by Skype. The cytopathologist would remotely guide the screening of the slides, zooming in and out of areas of interest. Remote assessment included an analysis of material adequacy and a preliminary diagnosis. The quality of the transmission and the number of slides also were recorded. After a washout period of 3 weeks, final diagnosis and adequacy were assigned by conventional microscopy.
RESULTS: The final agreement rate for adequacy between remote and conventional analysis was 90.5\%. For diagnosis, the final agreement rate was 83.3\%. The diagnosis agreement rate varied, depending on the quality of transmission: there was 88\% agreement when the quality was excellent, 77.8\% agreement when it was good, and 62.5\% agreement when it was poor.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-cost telecytopathology is an efficient method for the remote assessment of thyroid FNAB adequacy and diagnosis. The wide use of such technology in low-resource or remote centers may have a positive impact on the number of adequate or satisfactory samples, optimizing the management of patients who have thyroid nodules.},

	abstract = {AIM: The new REHAL® platform manages home-based cardiac rehabilitation programs without most of the drawbacks of an earlier E-Remedy EC proposal. The proposal is based on the awareness that safe home rehabilitation is only possible in the post-hospital phase when the patient no longer needs direct control by medical staff and has become accustomed to the technological set-up.
METHODS: The platform is composed of a web-based database and client software (Ergomonitor), which allows health staff to manage the sessions without a real-time connection and legal liability. Ergomonitor permits the complete management of a bike (training session settings, web transmission and data recording) by a serial connection to a PC. Patients own their data and may approve the access of health personnel to evaluate the results and introduce longitudinal ambulatory information together with updated physical activity protocols. The health service does not bear the cost of the technological set-up. Ergomonitor acquires and records heart rate, loads, pedalling speed and other parameters of interest (i.e., arterial pressure) and forwards data to a remote database. Health personnel can modify time by time the scheduled exercise settings, analyse the results of each session and compare session by session.
RESULTS: The platform is actually used in hospital, gymnasium and home context. More than 1000 subjects have been enrolled in the protocol, with a very good appreciation.
CONCLUSION: The first experience of REHAL® (six months, more than 1000 enrolled patients) highlights the positive aspects of the solution: the patients are very satisfied with the continuity of the rehabilitation programme and the clinicians are very satisfied they can follow their patient population longitudinally and with a personalized protocol.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ScriptAssist, a telehealth nursing program using psychological techniques, reduced emergency department (ED) utilization and improved adherence among Medicaid health plan members with serious and persistent mental illness (SPMI).
STUDY DESIGN: Nonrandomized controlled trial.
METHODS: Of 210 eligible Medicaid health plan members with SPMI, 59 (28\%) were contacted by phone and 51 (86\%) participated. Participants received an average of 3.5 calls over 9 months, with 2.1 attempts per completed call. Participants had clinically significant levels of impairment; medication switching, polypharmacy, and medical comorbidities were common. Intervention group participants' results were compared with those of nonparticipants to rule out regression to the mean, history, and maturation effects. Intervention group participants' results also were compared with baseline data to rule out selection bias.
RESULTS: Program participants had fewer ED visits during the intervention than a comparison group, and reduced their ED use and hospitalization rate compared with the previous year. Participants also had better medication adherence based on pharmacy and interview data.
CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive-behavioral and motivational-interviewing techniques can improve antipsychotic medication adherence. Telehealth may be a useful strategy for disseminating these evidence-based techniques. Lessons learned included the importance of real-time referral data, a need to address polypharmacy, and a need to overcome contact difficulties resulting from disease processes and "unknown caller" IDs. Despite these difficulties, using a disease management model, the program was feasible, and the reduced number of ED visits indicated potential cost-effectiveness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a political drive in the UK to use assistive technologies such as telehealth and telecare as an innovative and efficient approach to healthcare delivery. However, the success of implementation of such services remains dependent on the ability to engage the wider population to adopt these services. It has been widely acknowledged that low acceptance of technology, forms a key barrier to adoption although findings been mixed. Further, it remains unclear what, if any barriers exist between patients and how these compare to those who have declined or withdrawn from using these technologies. This research aims to address this gap focusing on the UK based Cambridgeshire Community Services Assistive Telehealth and Telecare service, an integrated model of telehealth and telecare.
METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted between 1st February 2014 and 1st December 2014, to explore the views and experiences of 'users' and 'non-users' using this service. 'Users' were defined as patients who used the service (N = 28) with 'non-users' defined as either referred patients who had declined the service before allocation (N = 3) or had withdrawn after using the ATT service (N = 9). Data were analysed using the Framework Method.
RESULTS: This study revealed that there are a range of barriers and facilitators that impact on the decision to adopt and continue to engage with this type of service. Having a positive attitude and a perceived need that could be met by the ATT equipment were influential factors in the decision to adopt and engage in using the service. Engagement of the service centred on 'usability', 'usefulness of equipment', and 'threat to identity and independence'.
CONCLUSIONS: The paper described the influential role of referrers in decision-making and the need to engage with such agencies on a strategic level. The findings also revealed that reassurance from the onset was paramount to continued engagement, particularly in older patients who appeared to have more negative feelings towards technology. In addition, there is a clear need for continued product development and innovation to not only increase usability and functionality of equipment but also to motivate other sections of the population who could benefit from such services. Uncovering these factors has important policy implications in how services can improve access and patient support through the application of assistive technology which could in turn reduce unnecessary cost and burden on overstretched health services.},

	doi = {10.1177/1084713811427707},
	abstract = {The need for reliable access to hearing health care services is growing globally, particularly in developing countries and in remotely located, underserved regions in many parts of the developed world. Individuals with hearing loss in these areas are at a significant disadvantage due to the scarcity of local hearing health care professionals and the high cost of hearing aids. Current approaches to making hearing rehabilitation services more readily available to underserved populations include teleaudiology and the provision of amplification devices outside of the traditional provider-client relationship. Both strategies require access to such resources as dedicated equipment and/or specially trained staff. Another possible strategy is a self-fitting hearing aid, a personal amplification device that is equipped with an onboard tone generator to enable user-controlled, automated, in situ audiometry; an onboard prescription to determine the initial hearing aid settings; and a trainable algorithm to enable user-controlled fine-tuning. The device is thus assembled, fitted, and managed by the user without the need for audiological or computer support. This article details the self-fitting concept and its potential application in both developing and developed countries. Potential advantages and disadvantages of such a device are discussed, and considerations for further investigations into the concept are presented. Overall, the concept is considered technologically viable with the main challenges anticipated to be development of clear, simple user instructions and a delivery model that ensures reliable supplies of instant-fit ear tips and batteries.},

	abstract = {With the advent of 4G and other long-term evolution (LTE) wireless networks, the traditional boundaries of patient record propagation are diminishing as networking technologies extend the reach of hospital infrastructure and provide on-demand mobile access to medical multimedia data. However, due to legacy and proprietary software, storage and decommissioning costs, and the price of centralization and redevelopment, it remains complex, expensive, and often unfeasible for hospitals to deploy their infrastructure for online and mobile use. This paper proposes the SparkMed data integration framework for mobile healthcare (m-Health), which significantly benefits from the enhanced network capabilities of LTE wireless technologies, by enabling a wide range of heterogeneous medical software and database systems (such as the picture archiving and communication systems, hospital information system, and reporting systems) to be dynamically integrated into a cloud-like peer-to-peer multimedia data store. Our framework allows medical data applications to share data with mobile hosts over a wireless network (such as WiFi and 3G), by binding to existing software systems and deploying them as m-Health applications. SparkMed integrates techniques from multimedia streaming, rich Internet applications (RIA), and remote procedure call (RPC) frameworks to construct a Self-managing, Pervasive Automated netwoRK for Medical Enterprise Data (SparkMed). Further, it is resilient to failure, and able to use mobile and handheld devices to maintain its network, even in the absence of dedicated server devices. We have developed a prototype of the SparkMed framework for evaluation on a radiological workflow simulation, which uses SparkMed to deploy a radiological image viewer as an m-Health application for telemedical use by radiologists and stakeholders. We have evaluated our prototype using ten devices over WiFi and 3G, verifying that our framework meets its two main objectives: 1) interactive delivery of medical multimedia data to mobile devices; and 2) attaching to non-networked medical software processes without significantly impacting their performance. Consistent response times of under 500 ms and graphical frame rates of over 5 frames per second were observed under intended usage conditions. Further, overhead measurements displayed linear scalability and low resource requirements.},

The medical home is characterized by the AAP as a care model that "must be accessible, family centered, continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective." However, some children and families use acute care services outside the medical home because there is a perceived or real benefit related to accessibility, convenience, or cost of care. Examples of such acute care entities include urgent care facilities, retail-based clinics, and commercial telemedicine services. Children deserve high-quality, appropriate, and safe acute care services wherever they access the health care system, with timely and complete communication with the medical home, to ensure coordinated and continuous care. Treatment of children under established, new, and evolving practice arrangements in acute care entities should adhere to the core principles of continuity of care and communication, best practices within a defined scope of services, pediatric-trained staff, safe transitions of care, and continuous improvement. In support of the medical home, the AAP urges stakeholders, including payers, to avoid any incentives (eg, reduced copays) that encourage visits to external entities for acute issues as a preference over the medical home.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of telemedicine in the management of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that multidisciplinary comprehensive HF care could achieve better results when it is delivered using telemedicine.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 178 eligible patients with HF were randomized to either structured follow-up on the basis of face-to-face encounters (control group, 97 patients) or delivering health care using telemedicine (81 patients). Telemedicine included daily signs and symptoms based on telemonitoring and structured follow-up by means of video or audio-conference. The primary end-point was non-fatal HF events after six months of follow-up. The median age of the patients was 77 years, 41\% were female, and 25\% were frail patients. The hazard ratio for the primary end-point was 0.35 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-0.59; p-value {\textless} 0.001) in favour of telemedicine. HF readmission (hazard ratio 0.39 (0.19-0.77); p-value=0.007) and cardiovascular readmission (hazard ratio 0.43 (0.23-0.80); p-value=0.008) were also reduced in the telemedicine group. Mortality was similar in both groups (telemedicine: 6.2\% vs control: 12.4\%, p-value {\textgreater} 0.05). The telemedicine group experienced a significant mean net reduction in direct hospital costs of €3546 per patient per six months of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients managed in the setting of a comprehensive HF programme, the addition of telemedicine may result in better outcomes and reduction of costs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop, implement, and evaluate a peer-led diabetes self-management support program in English and Spanish for a diverse, urban, low-income population. The program goals and objectives were to improve diabetes self-management behaviors, especially becoming more physically active, healthier eating, medication adherence, problem solving, and goal setting.
METHODS: After a new training program for peers led by a certified diabetes educator (CDE) was implemented with 5 individuals, this pilot evaluation study was conducted in 2 community settings in the East and South Bronx. Seventeen adults with diabetes participated in the new peer-led 5-session program. Survey data were collected pre- and postintervention on diabetes self-care activities, quality of well-being, and number of steps using a pedometer.
RESULTS: This pilot study established the acceptance and feasibility of both the peer training program and the community-based, peer-led program for underserved, minority adults with diabetes. Significant improvements were found in several physical activity and nutrition activities, with a modest improvement in well-being. Feedback from both peer facilitators and participants indicated that a longer program, but with the same educational materials, was desirable.
CONCLUSIONS: To reduce health disparities in urban communities, it is essential to continue program evaluation of the critical elements of peer-led programs for multiethnic adults with diabetes to promote self-management support in a cost-effective and culturally appropriate manner. Practice Implications A diabetes self-management support program can be successfully implemented in the community by peers, within a model including remote supervision by a CDE.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in information technology and telecommunications have provided the option of making it easier to diagnose and treat obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) using telemedicine techniques. This study assessed the feasibility and reliability of respiratory polygraphy and prescription of treatment by pressure adjustment with auto-continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) systems, both being transmitted telematically to the Sleep Unit, with teleconsultation as a support method.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty patients were studied from a population 80 km from the Sleep Unit using respiratory polygraphy transmitted in real time. They were divided into two groups: one was seen by conventional consultation, and the other was seen using teleconsultation. We also estimated satisfaction with this system and its costs.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 53 ± 10.3 years, with a body mass index of 31 ± 6.2 kg/m(2) and an Epworth score of 12 ± 5.3. In total, 35 patients were diagnosed with OSAS, with an Apnea-Hypopnea Index of ≥10, and CPAP treatment was started in 16 of them. The agreement in the Apnea-Hypopnea Index, total apneas and hypopneas, mean oxygen saturation, and time with an oxygen saturation {\textless}90\% was greater than 90\% between the studies transmitted in real time and those stored in the polygraph. The level of compliance with CPAP treatment was 85\% for the patients who were seen in a conventional clinic and 75\% in those seen by teleconsultation.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of telematic techniques is useful to establish a diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for OSAS with the creation of a Wide Core Sleep Laboratory as a process controller.},

The TMOC was more efficient, with a reduced number ( p {\textless} 0.003) and duration ( p {\textless} 0.01) of appointments required until discharge. Significant patient cost savings ( p = 0.002) were reported for the TMOC due to decreased travel requirements. While staff costs were reduced, additional telehealth equipment levies resulted in a lower but non-significant overall cost difference to the health service when using the TMOC. High satisfaction was reported by all participants attending the TMOC.

INTRODUCTION: To obtain baseline international data about telemedicine use among movement disorder clinicians.
METHODS: An online survey was sent to all 6,056 Movement Disorder Society members in 2015. Scope, reimbursement, and perceived quality of telemedicine were assessed.
RESULTS: There were 549 respondents (9.1\% overall response rate) from 83 countries. Most (85.8\%) were physicians, and most (70.9\%) worked in an academic or university practice. Half of respondents (n = 287, from 57 countries) used telemedicine for clinical care; activities included e-mail (63.2\%), video visits (follow-up [39.7\%] and new [35.2\%]), and video-based education (35.2\%). One hundred five respondents personally conducted video visits, most frequently to outpatient clinics (53.5\%), patient homes (30.8\%), and hospital inpatients (30.3\%). The most common challenges were a limited neurological examination (58.9\%) and technological difficulties (53.3\%), and the most common benefits were reduced travel time (92.9\%) and patient costs (60.1\%). The most frequent reimbursements were none (39.0\%), public insurance (24.5\%), and patient payment (9.3\%). Half of respondents planned to use telemedicine in the future, and three-quarters were interested in telemedicine education.
CONCLUSIONS: More than 250 respondents around the world engage in telemedicine for movement disorders; most perceived benefit for patients, despite challenges and reimbursement for clinicians. Formal instruction on telemedicine is highly desired. Although the survey response was low and possibly biased to over represent those with telemedicine experience, the study provides baseline data for future comparison and to improve telemedicine delivery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between pediatric critical care telemedicine consultation to rural emergency departments and triage decisions. We compare the triage location and provider rating of the accuracy of remote assessment for a cohort of patients who receive critical care telemedicine consultations and a similar group of patients receiving telephone consultations.
DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of consultations occurring between April 2012 and March 2016.
SETTING: Pediatric critical care telemedicine and telephone consultations in 52 rural healthcare settings in South Carolina.
PATIENTS: Pediatric patients receiving critical care telemedicine or telephone consultations.
INTERVENTION: Telemedicine consultations.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were collected from the consulting provider for 484 total consultations by telephone or telemedicine. We examined the providers' self-reported assessments about the consultation, decision-making, and triage outcomes. We estimate a logit model to predict triage location as a function of telemedicine consult age and sex. For telemedicine patients, the odds of triage to a non-ICU level of care are 2.55 times larger than the odds for patients receiving telephone consultations (p = 0.0005). Providers rated the accuracy of their assessments higher when consultations were provided via telemedicine. When patients were transferred to a non-ICU location following a telemedicine consultation, providers indicated that the use of telemedicine influenced the triage decision in 95.7\% of cases (p {\textless} 0.001). For patients transferred to a non-ICU location, an increase in transfers to a higher level of care within 24 hours was not observed.
CONCLUSION: Pediatric critical care telemedicine consultation to community hospitals is feasible and results in a reduction in PICU admissions. This study demonstrates an improvement in provider-reported accuracy of patient assessment via telemedicine compared with telephone, which may produce a higher comfort level with transporting patients to a lower level of care. Pediatric critical care telemedicine consultations represent a promising means of improving care and reducing costs for critically ill children in rural areas.},

Recent technologic advances in smartphones have allowed them to be used to acquire and transmit digital images of the glass slide, representing cost savings and efficiency gains over traditional forms of telepathology. We report our experience with developing an iPhone application (App - Pocket Pathologist) to facilitate rapid diagnostic pathology teleconsultation utilizing a smartphone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A secure, web-based portal (http://pathconsult.upmc.com/) was created to facilitate remote transmission of digital images for teleconsultation. The App augments functionality of the web-based portal and allows the user to quickly and easily upload digital images for teleconsultation. Image quality of smartphone cameras was evaluated by capturing images using different adapters that directly attach phones to a microscope ocular lens.
RESULTS: The App was launched in August 2013. The App facilitated easy submission of cases for teleconsultation by limiting the number of data entry fields for users and enabling uploading of images from their smartphone's gallery wirelessly. Smartphone cameras properly attached to a microscope create static digital images of similar quality to a commercial digital microscope camera.
CONCLUSION: Smartphones have great potential to support telepathology because they are portable, provide ubiquitous internet connectivity, contain excellent digital cameras, and can be easily attached to a microscope. The Pocket Pathologist App represents a significant reduction in the cost of creating digital images and submitting them for teleconsultation. The iPhone App provides an easy solution for global users to submit digital pathology images to pathology experts for consultation.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complications of pregnancy. Current approaches to GDM management and education are labor intensive and costly. Telemedicine offers a potential solution to reduce the time and cost burden of prenatal care for women with GDM.
METHODS: We assessed the acceptability of a telemedicine intervention to transmit patients' weight, blood pressure, and blood glucose measurements from wireless devices to health care providers, and to alternate "virtual office visits" with office-based prenatal visits. We administered surveys to 70 Kaiser Permanente Southern California members with GDM to assess preferences for modalities of GDM care delivery and to understand perceptions of telemedicine. We subsequently conducted 10 qualitative interviews among women with GDM to elicit perceptions about confidence and comfort with receiving care telephonically and safety concerns. Data were coded and categorized using analytic induction.
RESULTS: Training on these devices would increase participants' confidence in using the equipment. Continuity of care was perceived as an important factor in facilitating confidence with near universal preference for having virtual visits with the same clinician. Most participants were not concerned with the safety of their baby or themselves during the weeks without an office visit. One participant expressed an unwillingness to participate in the intervention because of a perceived association between having a high-risk pregnancy and an increased risk of pregnancy loss.
CONCLUSIONS: As telemedicine becomes increasingly common in health care, feedback from end users will be essential in tailoring, communicating about, and supporting the uptake and success of such programs.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The Magnetic Mini-Mover Procedure (3MP) uses a magnetic implant coupled with an external magnet to generate force sufficient to gradually remodel pectus excavatum deformities. This is an interim report of the evolution of the 3MP during a Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical trial.
METHODS: After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, we performed the 3MP on 10 otherwise healthy patients with moderate to severe pectus excavatum deformities (age, 8-14 years; Haller index {\textgreater}3.5). Operative techniques evolved to improve ease of implantation. Patients were evaluated monthly by a pediatric surgeon and orthotist. Electrocardiograms were performed pre- and postoperatively. Sternal position was documented by pre- and postprocedure computed tomographic scan, interval chest x-ray, depth gauge, and interval photographs.
RESULTS: There was no detectable effect of the static magnetic field on wound healing or cardiopulmonary function. No detectable injuries and minimal skin changes resulted from brace wear. Operative techniques evolved to include a custom sternal punch and a flexible guide wire to guide the posterior plate into position behind the sternum, reducing outpatient operating time to one-half hour. In 9 patients, the procedure was performed as an outpatient basis; and 1 patient was observed overnight. Three patients required evacuation of retained pleural air postoperatively, and 2 required an outpatient revision. A custom-fitted orthotic brace (Magnatract) was extensively modified to increase user friendliness and functionality while incorporating several novel functions: a screw displacement mechanism so patients can easily self-adjust magnetic force, a miniature data logger to measure force and temperature data every 10 minutes, and an interactive online Web portal for remote patient evaluation. All attempts to quantitate sternal position (radiographic, fluid volume, and depth gauge) were inadequate. Visual assessment remains the best indicator.
CONCLUSIONS: In this interim report, the 3MP appears to be a safe, minimally invasive, outpatient, cost-effective alternative treatment of pectus excavatum. Outcomes will be reported upon the completion of this phase II clinical trial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consumer-available virtual-reality technology was launched in 2016 with strong foundations in the entertainment-industry. We developed an innovative medical-training simulator on the Oculus™ Gear-VR platform. This novel application was developed utilising internationally recognised Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles, requiring decision-making skills for critically-injured virtual-patients.
METHODS: Participants were recruited in June, 2016 at a single-centre trauma-course (ATLS, Leinster, Ireland) and trialled the platform. Simulator performances were correlated with individual expertise and course-performance measures. A post-intervention questionnaire relating to validity-aspects was completed.
RESULTS: Eighteen(81.8\%) eligible-candidates and eleven(84.6\%) course-instructors voluntarily participated. The survey-responders mean-age was 38.9(±11.0) years with 80.8\% male predominance. The instructor-group caused significantly less fatal-errors (p {\textless} 0.050) and proportions of incorrect-decisions (p {\textless} 0.050). The VR-hardware and trauma-application's mean ratings were 5.09 and 5.04 out of 7 respectively. Participants reported it was an enjoyable method of learning (median-6.0), the learning platform of choice (median-5.0) and a cost-effective training tool (median-5.0).
CONCLUSION: Our research has demonstrated evidence of validity-criteria for a concept application on virtual-reality headsets. We believe that virtual-reality technology is a viable platform for medical-simulation into the future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are highly prevalent among college students. Most students with poor mental health, however, do not receive professional help. Internet-based self-help formats may increase the utilization of treatment.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based, app-supported stress management intervention for college students.
METHODS: College students (n=150) with elevated levels of stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4-item version, PSS-4 ≥8) were randomly assigned to either an internet- and mobile-based stress intervention group with feedback on demand or a waitlist control group. Self-report data were assessed at baseline, posttreatment (7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was perceived stress posttreatment (PSS-4). Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and college-related outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted in students with clinically relevant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale {\textgreater}17).
RESULTS: A total of 106 participants (76.8\%) indicated that they were first-time help-seekers, and 77.3\% (intervention group: 58/75; waitlist control group: 58/75) showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline. Findings indicated significant effects of the intervention compared with the waitlist control group for stress (d=0.69; 95\% CI 0.36-1.02), anxiety (d=0.76; 95\% CI 0.43-1.09), depression (d=0.63; 95\% CI 0.30-0.96), college-related productivity (d=0.33; 95\% CI 0.01-0.65), academic work impairment (d=0.34; 95\% CI 0.01-0.66), and other outcomes after 7 weeks (posttreatment). Response rates for stress symptoms were significantly higher for the intervention group (69\%, 52/75) compared with the waitlist control group (35\%, 26/75, P{\textless}.001; number needed to treat=2.89, 95\% CI 2.01-5.08) at posttest (7 weeks). Effects were sustained at 3-month follow-up, and similar findings emerged in students with symptoms of depression.
CONCLUSIONS: Internet- and mobile-based interventions could be an effective and cost-effective approach to reduce consequences of college-related stress and might potentially attract students with clinically relevant depression who would not otherwise seek help.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to ascertain determinants of unreadable fundus images for participants enrolled in the Philadelphia Telemedicine Glaucoma Detection and Follow-up Study.
METHODS: Individuals were screened for glaucoma at 7 primary care practices and 4 Federally Qualified Health Centers using telemedicine. Screening (visit 1) included fundus photography, assessing family history of glaucoma, and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements. Participants with an unreadable image in at least one eye were deemed unreadable and invited to return for a confirmatory eye examination (visit 2).
RESULTS: A total of 906 participants completed the visit 1 eye screening and 17.1\% (n=155/906) were "unreadable." In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, older age, male sex, smoking, and worse visual acuity were significantly associated with an unreadable fundus image finding at the eye screening (P{\textless}0.05). Of the 89 participants who were invited for the confirmatory eye examination solely for unreadable images and attended visit 2, 58 (65.2\%) were diagnosed with at least one ocular pathology. The most frequent diagnoses were cataracts (n=71; 15 visually significant, 56 nonvisually significant), glaucoma suspects (n=27), and anatomical narrow angle (n=10).
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the causes of unreadable fundus images will foster improvements in telemedicine techniques to optimize the predictive accuracy, efficiency, and cost in ophthalmology. A high proportion of participants with unreadable images (65.2\%) in our study were diagnosed with some ocular pathology, indicating that the finding of an unreadable fundus image warrants a referral for a comprehensive follow-up eye examination.},

This technology may also be useful in sanctuaries with large and/or complex enclosures. However, the cost of camera equipment and a lack of formal evaluations regarding the use of cameras in sanctuary settings make it challenging for facilities to decide whether and how to implement this technology. To address this, we evaluated the feasibility of using a video camera system to monitor chimpanzees at Chimp Haven. We viewed a group of resident chimpanzees in a large forested enclosure and compared observations collected in person and with remote video cameras. We found that via camera, the observer viewed fewer chimpanzees in some outdoor locations (GLMM post hoc test: est. = 1.4503, SE = 0.1457, Z = 9.951, p {\textless} 0.001) and identified a lower proportion of chimpanzees (GLMM post hoc test: est. = -2.17914, SE = 0.08490, Z = -25.666, p {\textless} 0.001) compared to in-person observations. However, the observer could view the 2 ha enclosure 15 times faster by camera compared to in person. In addition to these results, we provide recommendations to animal facilities considering the installation of a video camera system. Despite some limitations of remote monitoring, we posit that there are substantial benefits of using camera systems in sanctuaries to facilitate animal care and observational research.},

DESIGN: Qualitative study adopting an interpretive descriptive approach.
PARTICIPANTS: 23 patients, 6 nurses and 4 doctors who were participating in a RCT of blood glucose and BP telemonitoring. A maximum variation sample of patients from within the trial based on age, sex and deprivation status of the practice was sought.
SETTING: 12 primary care practices in Scotland and England.
METHOD: Data were collected via recorded semistructured interviews. Analysis was inductive with themes presented within an overarching thematic framework. Multiple strategies were employed to ensure that the analysis was credible and trustworthy.
RESULTS: Telemonitoring of blood glucose, BP and weight by people with type 2 diabetes was feasible. The data generated by telemonitoring supported self-care decisions and medical treatment decisions. Motivation to self-manage diet was increased by telemonitoring of blood glucose, and the 'benign policing' aspect of telemonitoring was considered by patients to be important. The convenience of home monitoring was very acceptable to patients although professionals had some concerns about telemonitoring increasing workload and costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring of blood glucose, BP and weight in primary care is a promising way of improving diabetes management which would be highly acceptable to the type of patients who volunteered for this study.

However, telephone consultation was also used linking stroke centres to smaller hospitals. We compared costs of telestroke services using audiovisual and telephone communication in different organizational models. Within a small network in Northern Bavaria video-based teleconsultation (VTC) and telephone advice (TA) was provided for evaluation of acute stroke patients on a weekly rotation. The costs of the admissions process with or without one of both methods of telemedicine were calculated and compared from the perspective of the spoke hospital. Different levels of service and network size were modelled and costs of transfers as well as loss of revenues were calculated. Yearly total labour costs were 415,000 € for an on-site service VTC-service compared to 61,000 € in an on-call service. Additional costs for one teleconsultation were 109.55 € in VTC and 49.82 € in TA (VTC/TA ratio 2.2). The ratio decreased to 0.8 when accounting for costs of transfer and loss of reimbursement for all patients transferred as transfer of patients to the stroke centre was more frequent after TA (9.1 vs. 14.9\%full-time on-site ser). Costs of one QALY gained by using VTC instead of TA ranged from 115.00 € to 515.86 € depending on the different models. In the first view TA looks like the less expensive method as it is easy to access and works without additional costs. When accounting for all disadvantages TA becomes slightly more expensive. In telestroke care VTC should be recommended as the method of choice also from an economic perspective.},

	abstract = {Teleradiology involves the creation of a radiographic image that is then transmitted electronically. It has been shown that low-cost teleradiology has a high level of agreement when comparing the original radiograph to the digital image. However, there has been little investigation of the effect of digitization on the score allocated by a grading scheme. Radiographs of 60 canine elbows were selected, each in three projections (mediolateral flexed, mediolateral neutral, craniocaudal). Each radiograph was photographed at 3 megapixel (3 M) and 6 megapixel (6 M) resolution using a digital camera. The images were placed in groups (radiographs, 3 M and 6 M) and randomized. Each elbow was independently graded by a radiologist and an orthopedic surgeon using the BVA elbow scoring scheme, with the different image sets interpreted separately. Intra and interobserver agreement was compared using a kappa analysis. The radiologist had substantial intraobserver agreement for repeated grading of radiographs, and moderate agreement for the other intraobserver tests (3 M vs. radiographs, 6 M vs. radiographs, 3 vs. 6 M). The surgeon had moderate to substantial agreement for the intraobserver tests. There was reduced interobserver agreement for all image groups. These results suggest that low-cost teleradiology may only allow moderate accuracy when used for grading schemes, and this may affect its use for breed scoring schemes. However, there appears to be an inherent subjectivity present in the elbow-grading scheme, seen in both intra and interobserver analysis. Therefore, further study of teleradiology using a different scoring model (e.g., hip dysplasia) may be indicated.},

METHODS: The identification process was based on several steps. For the quantitative synthesis, we used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. An additional set of criteria was defined for the following qualitative analysis.
RESULTS: 5 key cost indicators were identified with significant economic impact on the treatment costs of HF patients.
CONCLUSION: 95\% of the reported treatment costs could be captured based on the identified cost indicators.},

This paper reviews existing publications that describe the application and evaluation of technology-assisted interventions for parents of young children. A broad review of the early childhood literature revealed 48 studies describing technology-assisted parent education and interventions. Across these studies, multiple forms of technology were used, including web-based platforms, discussion forums, mobile devices, and video conferencing. Results are described moving from feasibility and acceptability of technology-based delivery systems to more rigorous evaluations examining their impact on parent and child outcomes. Potential exists for technology to deliver interventions to parents.

The Vet Connect project is a quality improvement project aiming to implement video technology to support access to specialty care. Methods: Eight Denver VAMC specialty care providers and three project nurses underwent telehealth training and obtained appropriate equipment. To identify in-person visits eligible for substitution of video visits, project nurses review charts of CNH Veterans, consult directly with Veterans, and obtain recommendations from staff. Project nurses serve as tele-presenters within the CNHs, while VA specialists provide care from the VAMC. After each visit, team nurses coordinate care with and deliver specialty care recommendations to CNH staff. Results: We assessed clinical, business, and technical domains of the Vet Connect project, and utilized process mapping to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. Clinically, starting on 26 June 2017 through 1 June 2018, N = 203 video visits have been conducted with 11 different CNHs in three subspecialties: geriatrics, palliative care, and mental health. These visits generated 49 referrals for 37 Veterans. Fiscally, cost analyses indicate that per visit, the health care system saves an estimated \$310. Technologically, the success rate was 83\%. Process mapping helped identify facilitators and barriers to implementation of the telehealth program, including cultivating buy-in from key stakeholders (i.e., medical and mental health providers, telehealth staff, and CNH staff), communication allowing for ongoing program adaptation, and building relationships. Conclusion: Subspecialty care delivery to nursing homes using video visit technology in the Vet Connect program is feasible using centralized organization to coordinate complex clinical, business and technical processes. Vet Connect has proved sustainable and has potential to expand within and outside of the VA.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition affecting nearly 5.7 million Americans and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. With an aging population, the cost associated with managing HF is expected to more than double from US \$31 billion in 2012 to US \$70 billion by 2030. Readmission rates for HF patients are high-25\% are readmitted at 30 days and nearly 50\% at 6 months. Low medication adherence contributes to poor HF management and higher readmission rates. Remote telehealth monitoring programs aimed at improved medication management and adherence may improve HF management and reduce readmissions.
OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this randomized controlled pilot study is to compare the MedSentry remote medication monitoring system versus usual care in older HF adult patients who recently completed a HF telemonitoring program. We hypothesized that remote medication monitoring would be associated with fewer unplanned hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, increased medication adherence, and improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to usual care.
METHODS: Participants were randomized to usual care or use of the remote medication monitoring system for 90 days. Twenty-nine participants were enrolled and the final analytic sample consisted of 25 participants. Participants completed questionnaires at enrollment and closeout to gather data on medication adherence, health status, and HRQoL. Electronic medical records were reviewed for data on baseline classification of heart function and the number of unplanned hospitalizations and ED visits during the study period.
RESULTS: Use of the medication monitoring system was associated with an 80\% reduction in the risk of all-cause hospitalization and a significant decrease in the number of all-cause hospitalization length of stay in the intervention arm compared to usual care. Objective device data indicated high adherence rates (95\%-99\%) among intervention group participants despite finding no significant difference in self-reported adherence between study arms. The intervention group had poorer heart function and HRQoL at baseline, and HRQoL declined significantly in the intervention group compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The MedSentry medication monitoring system is a promising technology that merits continued development and evaluation. The MedSentry medication monitoring system may be useful both as a standalone system for patients with complex medication regimens or used to complement existing HF telemonitoring interventions. We found significant reductions in risk of all-cause hospitalization and the number of all-cause length of stay in the intervention group compared to controls. Although HRQoL deteriorated significantly in the intervention group, this may have been due to the poorer HF-functioning at baseline in the intervention group compared to controls. Telehealth medication adherence technologies, such as the MedSentry medication monitoring system, are a promising method to improve patient self-management,the quality of patient care, and reduce health care utilization and expenditure for patients with HF and other chronic diseases that require complex medication regimens.

The TELEKAT project seeks to test and develop a preventive home monitoring concept across sectors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The concept of the TELEKAT project is to reduce admissions by enabling the COPD patients to conduct self-monitoring and maintain rehabilitation activities in their own home. COPD patients with severe and very severe COPD were included in the study.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This economic evaluation follows international guidelines for the conduction of a CUA alongside a clinical randomized controlled trial. The analysis is based on a health sector perspective.
RESULTS: The mean incremental cost efficiency ratio, located in the southeast quadrant, shows that telerehabilitation is less costly and more effective than the rehabilitation given to the control group. The telerehabilitation program produces more value for money and generates savings on healthcare budgets.
CONCLUSIONS: The telerehabilitation program appears to be more cost-effective than the conventional rehabilitation program for COPD patients. Further studies of cost-effectiveness with a focus on large-scale studies are needed.},

METHOD: Qualitative semi-structured interviews with 12 key informants explored for each project: the organisation and delivery of the education sessions; the utility of videoconferencing for delivering training programs; and the perceived potential to apply videoconferencing to other functions.
RESULTS: The projects were all delivered successfully through live videoconferencing. The main benefits observed were: the ability to deliver training to large numbers of people across multiple locations within a relatively short time and for reasonable costs; and the ability to improve access to high quality professional development for rural and remote workers. Technical difficulties were minor. The support required for these kinds of e-learning projects to succeed were identified.
CONCLUSION: The evaluation confirmed the value of videoconferencing as a vehicle through which equity of access to learning opportunities for population health workers across NSW can be achieved.},

Potential for cost-savings, time-savings, and increased access to care are the ultimate driving force behind use of this technology, for both providers and recipients of healthcare services. Recently, the Federal Government has initiated rulings to support the increased use of computer technology in underserved areas. Therefore, exploring novel applications of the technology of videoconferencing is timely. Remote lactation consultation may be one such novel application.
OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this pilot study was to describe the maternal experience of lactation consultation by means of videoconferencing, compared with standard face-to-face care, using grounded theory for model development.
METHODS: Twelve mothers participated in both a videoconferencing and a face-to-face consultation during one visit to the study site. Using grounded theory methods, responses to an in-depth phone interview occurring 3 days post-consultation were analyzed for major themes and a theoretical model proposed.
RESULTS: Three major themes emerged including maternal characteristics and interaction with technology, accuracy and trust determines acceptability for consultation type and, conditional acceptance of remote consultation use.
CONCLUSIONS: Emergent themes were grounded in existing literature, and potential scales were identified to assist with development of a future tool to test the theoretical model. Responses to the videoconferencing experience were positive, but preferred use of the technology was situational.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The Effectiveness and Cost of ICD follow-up Schedule with Telecardiology (ECOST) trial evaluated prospectively the economic impact of long-term remote monitoring (RM) of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs).
METHODS AND RESULTS: The analysis included 310 patients randomly assigned to RM (active group) vs. ambulatory follow-ups (control group). Patients in the active group were seen once a year unless the system reported an event mandating an ambulatory visit, while patients in the control group were seen in the ambulatory department every 6 months. The costs of each follow-up strategy were compared, using the actual billing documents issued by the French health insurance system, including costs of (i) (a) ICD-related ambulatory visits and transportation, (b) other ambulatory visits, (c) cardiovascular treatments and procedures, and (ii) hospitalizations for the management of cardiovascular events. The ICD and RM system costs were calculated on the basis of the device remaining longevity at the end of the study. The characteristics of the study groups were similar. Over a follow-up of 27 months, the mean non-hospital costs per patient-year were €1695 ± 1131 in the active, vs. €1952 ± 1023 in the control group (P = 0.04), a €257 difference mainly due to device management. The hospitalization costs per patient-year were €2829 ± 6382 and €3549 ± 9714 in the active and control groups, respectively (P = 0.46). Adding the ICD to the non-hospital costs, the savings were €494 (P = 0.005) or, when the monitoring system was included, €315 (P = 0.05) per patient-year.
CONCLUSION: From the French health insurance perspective, the remote management of ICD patients is cost saving.

This pilot study assessed the feasibility of empowering trained health workers equipped with ENTraview, a store-and-forward telemedicine device that integrates a camera- enabled smart phone with an otoscope. This device allows the screening of otology patients within the community. Three months of extensive training was provided to five community health workers on primary ear and hearing care, including training on the use of the ENTraview device. Community otology screenings were conducted to triage otology patients and provide them with specialized ENT care at a tertiary hospital. In the initial 6 months of the project, 45 screening camps were organized, which screened 3,000 patients free of cost. Of these 3,000 screened patients, 54\% (1,619) were referred for ENT consultation and 215 patients reported. Nearly 50\% (103) of the 215 reporting patients required surgical intervention, and 29 patients underwent surgery. Reaching out to the community by remote screening of ear diseases by trained technicians with a telemedicine device seems to be an effective and cost-effective way to triage patients with otologic pathologies.},

	abstract = {The current health care crisis in the United States compels a consideration of the crucial role that telemedicine could play towards deploying a pragmatic solution. The nation faces rising costs and difficulties in access to and quality of medical services. Telemedicine can potentially help to overcome these challenges, as it can provide new cost-effective and efficient methods of delivering health care across geographic distances. The full benefits and future potential of telemedicine, however, are constrained by overlapping, inconsistent, and inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks, as well as the repertoire of standards imposed by state governments and professional organizations. Proponents of these barriers claim that they are necessary to protect public health and safety, and that the U.S. Constitution gives states exclusive authority over health and safety concerns. This Article argues that such barriers not only fail to advance these public policy goals, but are unconstitutional when they restrict the practice of telemedicine across state and national borders. Furthermore, the interstate and international nature of telemedicine calls for increasing the centralized authority of the federal government; this position is consistent with the U.S. Constitution and other governing principles. Finally, this Article observes that the U.S. experience bears some similarities to that of other nations, and represents a microcosm of the international community's need and struggle to develop a uniform telemedicine regime. Just as with state governments in the U.S., nations are no longer able to view health care as a traditional domestic concern and must consider nontraditional options to resolve the dilemmas of rising costs and discontent in the delivery of health care to their people.},

Inspired by the phase detection concept in professional photography, we attached two pinhole-modulated cameras at the eyepiece ports for instant focal plane detection. By adjusting the positions of the pinholes, we can effectively change the view angle for the sample, and as such, we can use the translation shift of the two pinhole-modulated images to identify the optimal focal position. By using a small pinhole size, the focal-plane-detection range is on the order of millimeter, orders of magnitude longer than the objective's depth of field. We also show that, by analyzing the phase correlation of the pinhole-modulated images, we can determine whether the sample contains one thin section, folded sections, or multiple layers separated by certain distances - an important piece of information prior to a detailed z scan. In order to achieve system automation, we deployed a low-cost programmable robotic arm to perform sample loading and \$14 stepper motors to drive the microscope stage to perform x-y scanning. Using a 20X objective lens, we can acquire a 2 gigapixel image with 14 mm by 8 mm field of view in 90 seconds. The reported platform may find applications in biomedical research, telemedicine, and digital pathology. It may also provide new insights for the development of high-content screening instruments.},

RESULTS: According to the respondents, eHealth enhanced access to care for remote communities, and improved quality of health services by providing opportunities for continuing learning. Nurses also appreciated eHealth for reducing their professional isolation, and providing exposure to new knowledge through teleconsultations and eLearning.The responses categorized under six major headings include: gaps in health services prior to eHealth; role of eHealth in addressing these gaps; benefits of eHealth; challenges in eHealth implementation; community's perception about eHealth; and future recommendations.
CONCLUSIONS: Low-cost and simple eHealth solutions have shown to benefit nurses, and the communities in the remote mountainous regions of Pakistan.},

By analyzing the published tools and approaches which could be used in the context of telemedicine for tinnitus by health professionals or self-administrated by patients, this review summarizes, presents, and describes the principal telemedicine approaches available presently or in the near future to help assess or treat tinnitus or to offer support to tinnitus sufferers. Several pieces of evidence strongly support the feasibility of telemedicine approaches for tinnitus. Telemedicine can be used to help tinnitus sufferers at several points in the therapeutic process: for early screening, initial evaluation, and diagnosis; for optimizing therapeutic tools, particularly behavioural therapies and virtual reality-enhanced behavioral therapies; for long-term monitoring of patients and provision of online support. Several limitations are, however, discussed in order to optimize the safe development of such approaches. Cost effective and easy to implement, telemedicine is likely to represent an important part of the future of tinnitus therapies and should be progressively integrated by otolaryngologists.},

	abstract = {Research involving marine mammals often requires costly field programs. This paper assessed whether the benefits of using cameras outweighs the implications of having personnel performing marine mammal detection in the field. The efficacy of video and still cameras to detect Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in the Fremantle Harbour (Western Australia) was evaluated, with consideration on how environmental conditions affect detectability. The cameras were set on a tower in the Fremantle Port channel and videos were perused at 1.75 times the normal speed. Images from the cameras were used to estimate position of dolphins at the water's surface. Dolphin detections ranged from 5.6 m to 463.3 m for the video camera, and from 10.8 m to 347.8 m for the still camera. Detection range showed to be satisfactory when compared to distances at which dolphins would be detected by field observers. The relative effect of environmental conditions on detectability was considered by fitting a Generalised Estimation Equations (GEEs) model with Beaufort, level of glare and their interactions as predictors and a temporal auto-correlation structure. The best fit model indicated level of glare had an effect, with more intense periods of glare corresponding to lower occurrences of observed dolphins. However this effect was not large (-0.264) and the parameter estimate was associated with a large standard error (0.113). The limited field of view was the main restraint in that cameras can be only applied to detections of animals observed rather than counts of individuals. However, the use of cameras was effective for long term monitoring of occurrence of dolphins, outweighing the costs and reducing the health and safety risks to field personal. This study showed that cameras could be effectively implemented onshore for research such as studying changes in habitat use in response to development and construction activities.},

	abstract = {Referrals are traditionally defined as sending a patient to another program or practitioner for services or advice. The increasing adoption of electronic referral systems (eReferrals) requires a more complex model and shared understanding of what a referral is. eReferrals are designed to support writing referrals and automating referrals processing, and sometimes triaging. The reported benefits of eReferrals include secured delivery of referrals, improved efficiency, access to care, quality of care and continuity of care, better quality of documentation and communication, as well as reduced cost. Improvement in the time to prioritise referrals, more reliable and transparent referral handling, and better-supported hospital-community communications have been observed in regional eReferral trials in New Zealand. In the authors' opinion, teleconsultation and virtual shared care relationships have the potential to transform healthcare delivery, and they can be facilitated by eReferral technology. But the opportunities introduced by information technologies for eReferrals present several complex and contentious issues. This paper explores the potential roles and models for eReferral and its challenge to what constitutes a medical consultation. Future research is needed to understand how to facilitate and fund virtual clinics, and to support mentorships among healthcare professionals as well as for health consumers.},

	abstract = {Introduction: For telemonitoring to support care coordination, a sound business model is conditional. The aim of this study is to explore the systemic and economic differences in care coordination via business-to-business and business-to-consumer models for telemonitoring patients with chronic diseases.
Methods: We performed a literature search in order to design the business-to-business and business-to-consumer telemonitoring models, and to assess the design elements and themes by applying the activity system theory, and describe the transaction costs in each model. The design elements are content, structure, and governance, while the design themes are novelty, lock-in, complementarities, and efficiency. In the transaction cost analysis, we looked into all the elements of a transaction in both models.
Results: Care coordination in the business-to-business model is designed to be organized between the places of activity, rather than the participants in the activity. The design of the business-to-business model creates a firm lock-in but for a limited time. In the business-to-consumer model, the interdependencies are to be found between the persons in the care process and not between the places of care. The differences between the models were found in both the design elements and the design themes.
Discussion: Care coordination in the business-to-business and business-to-consumer models for telemonitoring chronic diseases differs in principle in terms of design elements and design themes. Based on the theoretical models, the transaction costs could potentially be lower in the business-to-consumer model than in the business-to-business, which could be a promoting economic principle for the implementation of telemonitoring.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to assess the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) model for telemonitoring patients with Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) by analysing the value it creates, both for organizations or ventures that provide telemonitoring services based on it, and for society.
METHODS: The business model assessment was based on the following categories: caveats, venture type, six-factor alignment, strategic market assessment, financial viability, valuation analysis, sustainability, societal impact, and technology assessment. The venture valuation was performed for three jurisdictions (countries) - Singapore, the Netherlands and the United States - in order to show the opportunities in a small, medium-sized, and large country (i.e. population).
RESULTS: The business model assessment revealed that B2C telemonitoring is viable and profitable in the Innovating in Healthcare Framework. Analysis of the ecosystem revealed an average-to-excellent fit with the six factors. The structure and financing fit was average, public policy and technology alignment was good, while consumer alignment and accountability fit was deemed excellent. The financial prognosis revealed that the venture is viable and profitable in Singapore and the Netherlands but not in the United States due to relatively high salary inputs.
CONCLUSIONS: The B2C model in telemonitoring CHF potentially creates value for patients, shareholders of the service provider, and society. However, the validity of the results could be improved, for instance by using a peer-reviewed framework, a systematic literature search, case-based cost/efficiency inputs, and varied scenario inputs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost effectiveness of home telemonitoring (HTM) and nurse telephone support (NTS) compared with usual care (UC) in the management of patients with chronic heart failure, from a third-party payer's perspective.
METHODS: We developed a Markov model with a 20-year time horizon to analyze the cost effectiveness using the original study (Trans-European Network-Home-Care Management System) and various data sources. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the decision uncertainty in our model.
RESULTS: In the original scenario (which concerned the cost inputs at the time of the original study), HTM and NTS interventions yielded a difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained compared with UC: 2.93 and 3.07, respectively, versus 1.91. An incremental net monetary benefit analysis showed €7,697 and €13,589 in HTM and NTS versus UC at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of €20,000, and €69,100 and €83,100 at a WTP threshold of €80,000, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were €12,479 for HTM versus UC and €8,270 for NTS versus UC. The current scenario (including telenurse cost inputs in NTS) yielded results that were slightly different from those for the original scenario, when comparing all New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes of severity. NTS dominated HTM, compared with UC, in all NYHA classes except NYHA IV.
CONCLUSIONS: This modeling study demonstrated that HTM and NTS are viable solutions to support patients with chronic heart failure. NTS is cost-effective in comparison with UC at a WTP of €9000/QALY or higher. Like NTS, HTM improves the survival of patients in all NYHA classes and is cost-effective in comparison with UC at a WTP of €14,000/QALY or higher.},

	volume = {131},
	issn = {0926-9630},
	shorttitle = {Intensive care telemedicine},
	abstract = {Historically, telemedicine has focused on the application of traditional physician-to-patient (and physician-to-physician) interactions enhanced by two-way video and audio capability. This "one-on-one" interaction via a telemedicine link can dramatically extend a physician's or other caregiver's geographic range and availability. However, this same telemedicine model is most often implemented "on-demand" for a specified time-limited encounter. The remote Intensive Care Unit (ICU) model to be described similarly expands the geographic range of ICU physicians, but also allows a single specialist to simultaneously monitor multiple patients on a continuous basis by leveraging computerized "intelligent" algorithms and an electronic medical record interface. This new application of telemedicine wedded to computer technology facilitates maximum leveraging of specialists' cognitive skills but also mandates significant process changes in how ICU services are provided. In short, the remote ICU represents a "re-engineering" of how ICU care is delivered and establishes a new paradigm for the field of telemedicine, expanding the reach, scope and availability of intensivist specialty expertise.The re-engineering occurs through a number of ways. First, the telemedicine connection is continuously available in a pro-active fashion that can be provided 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (24/7). Secondly, the system utilizes computerized clinical intelligence algorithms with direct electronic links to physiologic, laboratory and lab/pharmacy data as well as patient diagnoses to focus attention on potential adverse outcomes or trends in individual patients and notify caregivers before trends manifest as adverse outcomes. Third, the traditional physician, nurse, and patient relationship is substantially augmented when there is an ICU physician immediately available to address issues in patient care, particularly at night when physicians are less likely to be present at the bedside. The current preliminary data suggest that this system can be quite effective in improving ICU quality of care, thus leading to reductions in the cost of ICU care, ICU patient mortality, ICU patient outliers, and ICU length of stay (LOS). Given the extensive data showing improved ICU outcomes with daily ICU physician participation in care of critically ill patients, and the national shortage of ICU physicians, nurses, and ancillary staff; the electronic ICU system is gaining popularity as an alternative paradigm for the expansion of an ICU team's expertise in the care of the severely ill. Interestingly, internal Quality Improvement (QI) data from several healthcare systems have shown that improved outcomes occur even when remote ICU telemedicine is applied to a pre-existing 24/7 in-house intensivist care model. The reasons for this remain speculative at this point, but pro-active and hourly remote "virtual rounds" on the most critically-ill patients, and use of computerized algorithms in triaging ICU physicians' attention may contribute to the success of this system. Also, we will show how the system supports key elements of error reduction theory even in well-staffed critical care units. Multiple challenges remain before remote ICU systems become more broadly accepted and applied. These include cost of implementation of the system, resistance to the system by ICU physicians and nurses, and integration of data systems and clinical information into the remote electronic ICU model. In this chapter, we will provide background information on error reduction theory and the role of the remote ICU model, review current data supporting use of the remote ICU system, address the current obstacles to effective implementation, and look to the future of the field for solutions to these challenges.},

Method Eight participants were selected for the iPad LSVT, and 21 similarly matched subjects were selected from existing data to form the 'in person' group. Participants in both groups had diagnosed idiopathic Parkinson's disease and moderate hypokinetic dysarthria. Eighteen sessions of prescribed LSVT comprising a pre-treatment assessment, 16 treatment sessions, and a six months' post-treatment assessment were administered for each person. In both groups, pre- and post-treatment assessments were conducted face-to-face. Performance measures were recorded during assessment and treatment. Average measures were determined for all tasks at all time points and a summary outcome variable was composed from across-task performance. Results Non-inferiority testing confirmed that iPad LSVT was non-inferior in treating all LSVT task 3 variables except generating words, with the 90\% upper confidence intervals (CI) lying between the non-inferiority margin of ± 2.25 and zero. The iPad was superior in treating the task 3 rainbow reading passage and describing motor task variables with upper and lower 90\% CI values being negative. The improvement in the summary outcome variable score was also superior in the iPad group. Discussion Non-inferiority testing implies that the iPad LSVT is non-inferior in treating task three variables when compared to traditional LSVT. The study supports further development of remote delivery solutions involving the Apple iPad and 'Facetime' system as a means of improving access to services and the participant's experience.},

Teledermatology, or dermatology consultation from a distance using technology, is gaining greater acceptance among physicians and patients.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate feasibility and cost of a smartphone-based teledermatology consult service utilizing a designated medical student proxy to facilitate all consults on site, and to evaluate the service's effect upon diagnosis and management.
METHODS: An IRB-approved smartphone-based teledermatology consult service was established to serve two rural communities in the developing world: Kisoro, Uganda, and Lake Atitlán, Guatemala. Fourth-year medical students were recruited as proxies for each site, responding to consults by local doctors and transmitting photographs and clinical information via a smartphone application to a dermatology resident and attending in the USA over an encrypted website. At the Ugandan site, when indicated, the medical student performed skin biopsies under supervision, and rotating Montefiore residents transported specimens back to the USA.
RESULTS: From October 2011 to August 2012, 93 cases were evaluated by the consult service (57 from Uganda and 36 from Guatemala). Initial diagnoses changed completely in 55.9\% (52 of 93) of cases, and management changes were recommended in 89.2\% (83 of 93) of cases. The estimated total cost of supplies and technology was 42.01 USD per consult and 64.24 USD per biopsy (including processing). Given fixed upfront costs, the cost per consult decreased with each additional case.
CONCLUSION: Smartphone-based systems for teledermatology consultation using a medical student proxy are feasible for delivery of care in the developing world at relatively little cost. Optimization and sustainability of this system requires and deserves further investigation in larger studies.},

Seventeen participants answered this question; after redundancies were excluded, a total of 110 responses were collected. As the second step, participants were asked to rank which questions were the 35 most significant. The final step was to score 15 items for each of the 35 selected questions to determine whether it would be a) answerable, b) effective, c) deliverable, d) equitable, and e) effective at reducing the burden of mental health. The ten highest ranked questions were then selected.
RESULTS: There were four questions addressing primary care with respect to a) the effectiveness of interventions, b) "matrix support", c) comparisons of different models of stepped care, and d) interventions to enhance identification and treatment of common mental disorders at the Family Health Program. The other questions were related to the evaluation of mental health services for adults and children/adolescents to clarify barriers to treatment in primary care, drug addiction, and severe mental disorders; to investigate the cost-benefit relationship of anti-psychotics; to design interventions to decrease alcohol consumption; and to apply new technologies (telemedicine) for education and supervision of non-specialists.
CONCLUSION: This priority-setting research exercise highlighted a need for implementing investments at the primary-care level, particularly in the family health program; the urgent need to evaluate services; and policies to improve equity by increasing accessibility to services and testing interventions to reduce barriers for seeking mental health treatment.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Remote video consultations between clinician and patient are technically possible and increasingly acceptable. They are being introduced in some settings alongside (and occasionally replacing) face-to-face or telephone consultations.
METHODS: To explore the advantages and limitations of video consultations, we will conduct in-depth qualitative studies of real consultations (microlevel) embedded in an organisational case study (mesolevel), taking account of national context (macrolevel). The study is based in 2 contrasting clinical settings (diabetes and cancer) in a National Health Service (NHS) acute trust in London, UK. Main data sources are: microlevel--audio, video and screen capture to produce rich multimodal data on 45 remote consultations; mesolevel--interviews, ethnographic observations and analysis of documents within the trust; macrolevel--key informant interviews of national-level stakeholders and document analysis. Data will be analysed and synthesised using a sociotechnical framework developed from structuration theory.
ETHICS APPROVAL: City Road and Hampstead NHS Research Ethics Committee, 9 December 2014, reference 14/LO/1883.
PLANNED OUTPUTS: We plan outputs for 5 main audiences: (1) academics: research publications and conference presentations; (2) service providers: standard operating procedures, provisional operational guidance and key safety issues; (3) professional bodies and defence societies: summary of relevant findings to inform guidance to members; (4) policymakers: summary of key findings; (5) patients and carers: 'what to expect in your virtual consultation'.
DISCUSSION: The research literature on video consultations is sparse. Such consultations offer potential advantages to patients (who are spared the cost and inconvenience of travel) and the healthcare system (eg, they may be more cost-effective), but fears have been expressed that they may be clinically risky and/or less acceptable to patients or staff, and they bring significant technical, logistical and regulatory challenges. We anticipate that this study will contribute to a balanced assessment of when, how and in what circumstances this model might be introduced.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acceptance and cost of a ward-based geriatric consultation service delivered via a mobile videoconferencing system.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective observational study conducted in the geriatric unit of Toowoomba Base Hospital, Queensland, comparing a specialist consultation service delivered by videoconference (VC) with a "traditional" in-person service. The VC system was established in January 2007 and evaluated over an 18-month period. Patient satisfaction with the service was assessed by questionnaire during a 1-week period in September 2008.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital acceptance of the service; patient satisfaction with the service; comparative cost of providing in-person and VC-mediated consultations.
RESULTS: Uptake of the service increased progressively throughout the study period. Patient acceptance levels were high. The cost of video consultations for a 12-patient ward round and case conference was less than the cost of in-person consultations if the total road distance travelled by the specialist (Brisbane to Toowoomba and back) was 125 km or longer.
CONCLUSION: Consultations via VC are an acceptable alternative to in-person consultations, and are less expensive than in-person consultations for even modest distances travelled by the clinician.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Society launched LivingWell@Home (LW@H) to provide telehealth services to clients in assisted living and home healthcare. LW@H assures client safety through remote monitoring of physiological parameters and assessment of nonbiometric parameters. Public policies increasingly support aging in place by allowing older adults with greater levels of impairment avoid or delay nursing home placement through alternative services offered in assisted living facilities and home healthcare agencies. Provider organizations face challenges caring for frail seniors with complex medical needs. Telehealth services may be helpful in supporting frail seniors living at home.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seniors were recruited into a randomized trial. Telehealth services were provided to 820 experimental subjects. Control subjects (n=762) received usual care. Clients rated their satisfaction at three points in time postimplementation: baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Fisher's exact test compared client ratings at each measurement interval.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between experimental and control subjects at baseline. Statistically significant differences emerged at follow-up. Experimental subjects in home healthcare agencies reported higher levels of satisfaction relative to controls, whereas experimental subjects in assisted living facilities reported lower levels of satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth services increased the probability that clients will be more satisfied compared with those without telehealth in homecare agencies. The opposite effect resulted among assisted living residents. Value propositions among community-dwelling older adults may influence their satisfaction with telehealth services postimplementation. More research is needed to examine the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these services.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of remote diagnosis of congenital heart disease (CHD) by real-time transmission of echocardiographic images via integrated services digital network (ISDN) lines, to assess the impact on patient management and examine cost implications.
DESIGN: Prospective comparison of echocardiograms on infants with suspected significant CHD performed as follows: (1) hands-on evaluation and echocardiogram by a paediatrician at a district general hospital (DGH) followed by (2) transmission of the echocardiogram via ISDN 6 with guidance from a paediatric cardiologist and finally (3) hands-on evaluation and echocardiogram by a paediatric cardiologist. The economic analysis compares the cost of patient care associated with the telemedicine service with a hypothetical control group.
SETTING: Neonatal units of three DGH and a UK regional paediatric cardiology unit.
RESULTS: Echocardiograms were transmitted on 124 infants. In five cases scans were inadequate for diagnosis. Of the remaining 119 tele-echocardiograms, a follow-up echocardiogram was performed on 109/119 (92\%). Major CHD was diagnosed in 39/109 infants (36\%) and minor CHD in 45 (41\%). The tele-echo diagnosis was accurate in 96\% of cases (kappa=0.89). Unnecessary transfer to the regional unit was avoided in 93/124 patients (75\%). Despite relatively high implementation costs, telemedicine care was substantially cheaper than standard care. Each DGH potentially saved money by utilising the telemedicine service (mean saving: pound728/patient).
CONCLUSIONS: CHD is accurately diagnosed by realtime transmission of echocardiograms performed by paediatricians under live guidance and interpretation by a paediatric cardiologist. Remote diagnosis and exclusion of CHD affects patient management and may be cost saving.},

We used claims' data gathered by a major Swiss health insurer, over a period of 6 years and involving 160 000 insured adults. In Switzerland, health insurance is mandatory, but everyone has the option of choosing between a managed care plan and a fee-for-service plan. This paper focuses on a conventional fee-for-service plan including a mandatory access to a telemedicine service; the insured are obliged to phone this medical call centre before visiting a physician. This type of plan generates much lower average health expenditures than a conventional insurance plan. Reasons for this may include selection, incentive effects or efficiency. In our sample, about 90\% of the difference in health expenditure can be explained by selection and incentive effects. The remaining 10\% of savings due to the efficiency of the telemedicine service amount to about SFr 150 per year per insured, of which approximately 60\% is saved by the insurer and 40\% by the insured. Although the efficiency effect is greater than the cost of the plan, the big winners are the insured who not only save monetary and non-monetary costs but also benefit from reduced premiums.},

DESIGN: All program activities and resultant clinical outcomes were tracked over 4 years using an adapted version of the Care Coordination Measurement Tool. Patient characteristics, program activity, and acute care resource utilization were prospectively documented in the adapted version of the Care Coordination Measurement Tool and retrospectively cross-validated with hospital billing data. Impact on total costs of care was then estimated based on program outcomes and nationally representative administrative data.
SETTING: Tertiary children's hospital.
SUBJECTS: Critical Care, Anesthesia, Perioperative Extension and Home Ventilation Program enrollees.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The program provided care for 346 patients and families over the study period. Median age at enrollment was 6 years with more than half deriving secondary respiratory failure from a primary neuromuscular disease. There were 11,960 encounters over the study period, including 1,202 home visits, 673 clinic visits, and 4,970 telephone or telemedicine encounters. Half (n = 5,853) of all encounters involved a physician and 45\% included at least one care coordination activity. Overall, we estimated that program interventions were responsible for averting 556 emergency department visits and 107 hospitalizations. Conservative monetization of these alone accounted for annual savings of \$1.2-2 million or \$407/pt/mo net of program costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Innovative models, such as extension of critical care services, for high-risk, high-cost patients can result in immediate cost savings. Evaluation of financial implications of comprehensive care for high-risk patients is necessary to complement clinical and patient-centered outcomes for alternative care models. When year-to-year cost variability is high and cost persistence is low, these savings can be estimated from documentation within care coordination management tools. Means of financial sustainability, scalability, and equal access of such care models need to be established.},

An alternative may be a telemedicine system where retinal images of at-risk infants are graded by readers to determine features of ROP indicating the need for a DE.
METHODS: The multicenter Telemedicine Approaches to Evaluating Acute-phase ROP (e-ROP) Study is a cohort study of 2000 infants with birth weights {\textless}1251 g. At each visit, ophthalmologists perform DEs and non-physician imagers obtain iris and five retinal images with the disc positioned in the center, right, left, up and down. Images are uploaded to a secure server for grading by non-physician readers for the detection of plus disease, stage 3 ROP and/or zone I disease, any of which indicates "referral-warranted ROP" (RW-ROP). Images from all infants with RW-ROP and a random sample of infants without RW-ROP (based on DEs) are selected for grading. Gradings are compared to DEs to determine the validity and evaluate reliability, feasibility, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the telemedicine system.
RESULTS: e-ROP is conducted in 12 Clinical Centers in the US and Canada with Study Headquarters, the Data Coordinating Center and the Image Reading Center in Philadelphia and the ROP Data Center in Oklahoma City. A total of 27 study center coordinators, 34 ophthalmologists, 26 imagers, and 4 readers have been certified. All study data are submitted using a secure web-based system.
CONCLUSION: The design and findings of this study will be useful to conduct other ROP studies or evaluate telemedicine for other diseases.},

This study aims to determine the capabilities and equipment required for the implementation of telepathology from the viewpoints of managers, IT professionals, and pathologists of the hospitals of West Azerbaijan, Iran.
Methods: This is a descriptive-analytical study conducted as a cross-sectional study in 2015. All public and private hospitals of West Azerbaijan were selected as the study sites. The population of the study was the managers, directors, pathologists, and IT professionals of the hospitals. The study population was considered as the study sample. Data were collected using questionnaires. The validity and reliability of the questionnaires were assessed, and data were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Product and Services Solutions, version 16.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results: The mean awareness of the study population of telepathology in the studied hospitals was 2.43 with a standard deviation of 0.89. According to analysis results (F = 7.211 and P = 0.001), in the studied hospitals, the mean awareness of pathologists, managers, directors, and IT professionals' of telepathology is significant. In addition, the mean awareness of pathologists is higher than that of managers, directors, and IT professionals, and this relation is significant (P = 0.001). According to IT professionals, among the influential dimensions of the implementation of telepathology in the studied hospitals, the effect of all dimensions, except hardware capabilities, was above moderate level.
Conclusion: According to our findings, stakeholders believe that the implementation of telepathology promotes the quality of health-care services and caring patients on the one hand and decreases health-care costs on the other hand. Therefore, it crucial and important to consider users' viewpoints into the process of implementing such systems as they play a vital role in the success or failure, and the accurate estimation of required sources, of the systems.},

Patients with limb amputations who experience phantom limb pain (PLP) are typically treated unsuccessfully using medications, injections, or additional surgeries. Mirror therapy is a noninvasive, cost-effective alternative to current treatment options for PLP.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report 2 patients who self-administered mirror therapy at home after receiving detailed instructions from a physician by e-mail.
RESULTS: The intervention resulted in complete resolution of PLP. The first patient experienced a reduction in the severity and frequency of PLP episodes after 4 weeks of treatment. Pain completely resolved after an additional 4 weeks of treatment, which was restarted 4 months after the initial course of therapy. The second patient experienced complete eradication of pain after 4 weeks of treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: PLP relief can be obtained using home-based mirror therapy with initiation, feedback, and follow-up with healthcare professionals conducted entirely through telemedicine.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to investigate the feasibility and initial efficacy of telehealth communication in conjunction with surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) resistance training (RT) to induce muscle hypertrophy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a home-based setting of within-subject control design of trained vs controlled limbs. Five men with chronic ({\textgreater}1 year postinjury) motor-complete spinal cord injury (SCI) participated in a twice-weekly telehealth videoconference program using home-based NMES-RT for 8 weeks. Stimulation was applied to the knee extensor muscle group of the trained leg, while the untrained leg served as a control. Participants received real-time feedback to ensure a proper setup of electrodes and stimulator to monitor subject safety throughout the entire training session. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure cross-sectional areas (CSAs) and intramuscular fat (IMF) of the whole thigh and individual muscle groups. Average two-way travel time, distance traveled in miles and total cost of gas per mile were calculated.
RESULTS: Participants had 100\% compliance. Trained whole and absolute knee extensor muscle CSA increased by 13\% (P=0.002) and 18\% (P=0.0002), with no changes in the controlled limb. Absolute knee flexor and adductor CSAs increased by 3\% (P=0.02) and 13\% (P=0.0001), respectively. Absolute whole thigh and knee extensor IMF CSAs decreased significantly in the trained limb by 14\% (P=0.01) and 36\% (P=0.0005), respectively, with no changes in controlled limb.
DISCUSSION: The pilot work documented that using telehealth communication is a safe, feasible and potentially cost-reducing approach for monitoring home-based NMES-RT in persons with chronic SCI. All trained muscles showed detectable muscle hypertrophy with concomitant decrease in ectopic adipose tissue.},

	abstract = {AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an automated telephone-linked care intervention, Australian TLC Diabetes, delivered over 6 months to patients with established Type 2 diabetes mellitus and high glycated haemoglobin level, compared to usual care.
METHODS: A Markov model was designed to synthesize data from a randomized controlled trial of TLC Diabetes (n=120) and other published evidence. The 5-year model consisted of three health states related to glycaemic control: 'sub-optimal' HbA1c ≥58mmol/mol (7.5\%); 'average' ≥48-57mmol/mol (6.5-7.4\%) and 'optimal' {\textless}48mmol/mol (6.5\%) and a fourth state 'all-cause death'. Key outcomes of the model include discounted health system costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYS) using SF-6D utility weights. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken.
RESULTS: Annual medication costs for the intervention group were lower than usual care [
INTERVENTION: £1076 (95\%CI: £947, £1206) versus usual care £1271 (95\%CI: £1115, £1428) p=0.052]. The estimated mean cost for intervention group participants over five years, including the intervention cost, was £17,152 versus £17,835 for the usual care group. The corresponding mean QALYs were 3.381 (SD 0.40) for the intervention group and 3.377 (SD 0.41) for the usual care group. Results were sensitive to the model duration, utility values and medication costs.
CONCLUSION: The Australian TLC Diabetes intervention was a low-cost investment for individuals with established diabetes and may result in medication cost-savings to the health system. Although QALYs were similar between groups, other benefits arising from the intervention should also be considered when determining the overall value of this strategy.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to analyze the care provided and the cost of virtual visits over a 3-week episode compared with in-person visits to retail health clinics (RHC), urgent care centers (UCC), emergency departments (ED), or primary care physicians (PCP) for acute, nonurgent conditions.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, retrospective analysis of claims from a large commercial health insurer was performed to compare care and cost of patients receiving care via virtual visits for a condition of interest (sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, urinary tract infection, conjunctivitis, bronchitis, pharyngitis, influenza, cough, dermatitis, digestive symptom, or ear pain) matched to those receiving care for similar conditions in other settings. An episode was defined as the index visit plus 3 weeks following. Patients were children and adults younger than 65 years of age without serious chronic conditions. Visits were classified according to the setting where the visit occurred. Care provided was assessed by follow-up outpatient visits, ED visits, or hospitalizations; laboratory tests or imaging performed; and antibiotic use after the initial visit. Episode costs included the cost of the initial visit, subsequent medical care, and pharmacy.
RESULTS: A total of 59,945 visits were included in the analysis (4635 virtual visits and 55,310 nonvirtual visits). Virtual visit episodes had similar follow-up outpatient visit rates (28.09\%) as PCP (28.10\%, P=.99) and RHC visits (28.59\%, P=.51). During the episode, lab rates for virtual visits (12.56\%) were lower than in-person locations (RHC: 36.79\%, P{\textless}.001; UCC: 39.01\%, P{\textless}.001; ED: 53.15\%, P{\textless}.001; PCP: 37.40\%, P{\textless}.001), and imaging rates for virtual visits (6.62\%) were typically lower than in-person locations (RHC: 5.97\%, P=.11; UCC: 8.77\%, P{\textless}.001; ED: 43.06\%, P{\textless}.001; PCP: 11.26\%, P{\textless}.001). RHC, UCC, ED, and PCP were estimated to be \$36, \$153, \$1735, and \$162 more expensive than virtual visit episodes, respectively, including medical and pharmacy costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Virtual care appears to be a low-cost alternative to care administered in other settings with lower testing rates. The similar follow-up rate suggests adequate clinical resolution and that patients are not using virtual visits as a first step before seeking in-person care.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Developments in telemedicine have not produced any relevant benefits for orthopedics and trauma surgery to date. For the present project study, several parameters were examined during assessment of x-ray images, which had been photographed and transmitted via cell phone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 x-ray images of various body regions were photographed with a Nokia cell phone and transmitted via email or MMS. Next, the transmitted photographs were reviewed on a laptop computer by five medical specialists and assessed regarding quality and diagnosis.
RESULTS: Due to their poor quality, the transmitted MMS images could not be evaluated and this path of transmission was therefore excluded. Mean size of transmitted x-ray email images was 394 kB (range: 265-590 kB, SD ± 59), average transmission time was 3.29 min ± 8 (CI 95\%: 1.7-4.9). Applying a score from 1-10 (very poor - excellent), mean image quality was 5.8. In 83.2 ± 4\% (mean value ± SD) of cases (median 82; 80-89\%), there was agreement between final diagnosis and assessment by the five medical experts who had received the images. However, there was a markedly low concurrence ratio in the thoracic area and in pediatric injuries.
DISCUSSION: While the rate of accurate diagnosis and indication for surgery was high with a concurrence ratio of 83\%, considerable differences existed between the assessed regions, with lowest values for thoracic images. Teleradiology is a cost-effective, rapid method which can be applied wherever wireless cell phone reception is available. In our opinion, this method is in principle suitable for clinical use, enabling the physician on duty to agree on appropriate measures with colleagues located elsewhere via x-ray image transmission on a cell phone.},

In any new programme aiming to enhance the quality of inflammatory bowel disease management, a key element should be the inclusion of new patient information and communication systems to increase treatment adherence. The new tools available in the telemedicine era provide an opportunity to improve the care of inflammatory bowel disease, but their success is limited by multiple problems.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Telemedicine is gaining popularity for a variety of indications. We performed a randomized controlled trial comparing telemedical versus conventional clinic follow-up in terms of feasibility and quality.
METHODS: Patients discharged from pediatric surgery were randomized to telemedical or onsite follow-up. In the telemedical group, video telephony was used to obtain interim history and physical findings. Onsite patients were personally seen in the outpatient clinic. Caregivers completed a postvisit survey on satisfaction and efficiency. Providers scored data transmission quality and clinical interpretability.
RESULTS: From March 2015 until January 2017, 224 patients were randomized equally to the study groups. Telemedicine was highly accepted by caregivers, and data transmission quality was sufficient for comprehensive follow-up. No important clinical findings were missed. Quality of interaction scored higher in the telemedical versus the onsite group (77.8\% vs. 48\%, p {\textless} 0.001) as did caregiver satisfaction (5.4 vs. 5.1, p {\textless} 0.03). Travel investment, time required, loss of earnings, and days off from work/school were all significantly lower in the telemedical group (p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Telemedical posthospitalization follow-up in pediatric surgery provides a cost-effective, time-saving alternative for patients and caregivers that is well received and accepted. The quality of clinical data transmission is sufficient to provide safe care and uncompromised clinical judgment.

This study examined  the potential for applying telehealth in a region of the UK by exploring the distribution of patients and examining attitudes to  implementation of telehealth.
METHODS: The distribution of patients with asthma, COPD, lung cancer and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSAS) in the NHS Highland Region  (309,900 residents, 12,507 square miles) was determined from Quality and Outcomes Framework data and disease registers. Qualitative  interviews with health professionals (n=20) focussing on the potential for telehealth in respiratory medicine were analysed using the  Normalisation Process Model.
RESULTS: The most remote general practices accounted for 40\% of patients with asthma (7198/17822), 45\% of those with COPD  (2145/4721), 33\% of lung cancer (199/605) and 35\% of OSAS (169/489) patients. Urban figures were 28\% of asthma patients, 26\% of  COPD patients, 25\% of lung cancer and 31\% of OSAS patients. Interviewees identified a range of telehealth applications they considered  potentially beneficial including management, information and communication systems. However, they also identified challenges - mainly  related to training, costs and infrastructure.
CONCLUSIONS: Tailoring telehealth to support management of respiratory diseases in primary care requires knowledge of patient  distribution, which will impact on the nature and feasibility of services. Individual and organisational capacities and attitudes are also likely  to influence successful implementation.},

More robust data are also needed on how well clinical trials are translated into contemporary community practice and the associated resource use, costs, and outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recently established the Cardiovascular Research Network, which represents a new paradigm to evaluate the epidemiology, quality of care, and outcomes of cardiovascular disease and to conduct future clinical trials using a community-based model. The network includes 15 geographically distributed health plans with dedicated research centers, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute representatives, and an external collaboration and advisory committee. Cardiovascular research network sites bring complementary content and methodological expertise and a diverse population of approximately 11 million individuals treated through various health care delivery models. Each site's rich electronic databases (eg, sociodemographic characteristics, inpatient and outpatient diagnoses and procedures, pharmacy, laboratory, and cost data) are being mapped to create a standardized virtual data warehouse to facilitate rapid and efficient large-scale research studies. Initial projects focus on (1) hypertension recognition and management, (2) quality and outcomes of warfarin therapy, and (3) use, outcomes, and costs of implantable cardioverter defibrillators.
CONCLUSIONS: The Cardiovascular Research Network represents a new paradigm in the approach to cardiovascular quality of care and outcomes research among community-based populations. Its unique ability to characterize longitudinally large, diverse populations will yield novel insights into contemporary disease and risk factor surveillance, management, outcomes, and costs. The Cardiovascular Research Network aims to become the national research partner of choice for efforts to improve the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of cardiovascular diseases.},

STUDY DESIGN: A histopathologist examined 106 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of low- and high-grade astrocytomas. Interobserver-checked cases were reviewed under a microscope to estimate the accuracy of the conventional glass slide diagnoses. Then cases based on 5 static-digitized images from each patient were diagnosed. Next, the grade of each tumor was assessed based on the set of 5 images and the World Health Organization (WHO) description of 8 histologic characteristics defined as crucial in grading astrocytomas. Finally, an evaluation was made using a custom-designed decision support system.
RESULTS: Conventional glass slide diagnosis was 93.9\%. Diagnosis based only on the set of 5 images dropped to 81.6\%. Diagnosis based on the set of 5 images and the WHO characteristics boosted accuracy to 88.8\%. Accuracy improved to 91.8\% with the addition of the decision support system.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that a telepathology system might be valuable for accurate grade diagnosis of astrocytomas-providing a means for avoiding diagnostic errors-without blocks or slides having to leave the department. This could significantly reduce the overall time and cost of diagnosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Postural screening remains a powerful tool that can be used to identify children and adolescents with scoliosis or sagittal plane deformities. The aim of this study was to assess the time effectiveness of implemented telediagnostic screening procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical images (virtual objects) of acquired clouds of points of 100 subjects of both sexes were chosen at random from the database and used for parametric evaluation for this study. This study was performed using a newly developed three-dimensional (3D) back surface topography measurement system for posture and scoliosis using a structured light method. The duration of each step of therapist/nurse/physician-assisted 3D assessment was measured independently with a stopwatch. Two configurations of PC computers and Internet connections were used to test the time effectiveness. Scoliotic postures were detected using cutoff values of angle of trunk rotation, Posterior Trunk Symmetry Index, and Deformity in the Axial Plane Index indices.
RESULTS: The overall assessment of all subjects consumed from 2 h 55 min 55 s to 3 h 18 min 59 s dependent on PC and Internet connection configuration. Average examination time per subject ranged from 2 min 43 s to 4 min 51 s, respectively. The virtual landmarking and report generation times were dependent on the PC configuration (p{\textless}0.001). Our study confirmed satisfactory time effectiveness of the implemented telediagnostic postural screening procedure. We assume that it may influence the cost-effectiveness of the screening, which is usually mentioned as an important factor for recommendations against postural school screening. Relatively fast Internet connection and a medium-level PC configuration are sufficient for achieving a reasonably short time of 3D posture assessment of a virtual object representing a real subject's back surface.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficiency of remote assessment of exact 3D surface topography can be used in large-scale studies for posture and scoliosis epidemiology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A growing use of telemedicine has been observed, especially as regards the sending and evaluation of electrocardiograms (ECG); this is a low-cost procedure with a high potential to save lives.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the form of systematic analysis and user profile of the Telemedicine Network of Santa Catarina during the time when the report was issued freely.
METHODS: Observational cross-sectional study determining the associations between patient characteristics and electrocardiographic diagnoses issued among users of the Telemedicine Network of Santa Catarina during the time when the report was issued freely. This system was connected to 287 cities in Santa Catarina; the tests were done in the places of origin and the reports were issued in three tertiary-care hospitals. From 2005 to 2010 the reports were issued freely and a probabilistic method for data analysis was created. An experienced cardiologist evaluated all ECGs to assess the chances of abnormality.
RESULTS: 243,363 ECGs were evaluated. The majority (58\%) was performed on patients older than 50 years from primary care services (72\%). There were differences in the frequency per region; this was partly related to the number of cardiologists/region (r = -0.551), to the distance from tertiary-care centers and potential differences of acceptance of the method. Approximately 53\% of the ECGs were abnormal with greater frequency with increasing age (r(2) = 0.8166) and with significant regional differences (p {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: We built a data analysis system integrating prevalent terms, probabilistic analysis and specialized dictionaries. The system has covered a significant portion of the population of Santa Catarina, mainly elderly patients from the network of primary healthcare centers and remote regions of the State.},

Robotic assistance is considered one innovation within abdominal surgery over the past decade that has the potential to compensate for the drawbacks of conventional laparoscopy. The dramatic evolution of robotic surgery over the past 10 years is likely to be eclipsed by even greater advances over the next decade. We review the current status of robotic technology in surgery. The Medline database was searched for the terms "robotic surgery, telesurgery, and laparoscopy." A total of 2,496 references were found. All references were considered for information on robotic surgery in advanced laparoscopy. Further references were obtained through cross-referencing the bibliography cited in each work. There is a paucity of control studies on a sufficient number of subjects in robot-assisted surgeries in all fields. Studies that meet more stringent clinical trials criteria show that robot-assisted surgery appears comparable to traditional surgery in terms of feasibility and outcomes but that costs associated with robot-assisted surgery are higher because of longer operating times and expense of equipment. While a limited number of studies on the da Vinci robotic system have proven the benefit of this approach in regard to patient outcomes, including significantly reduced blood loss, lower percentage of postoperative complications, and shorter hospital stays, there are mechanical and institutional risks that must be more fully addressed. Robotic assistance will remain an intensively discussed subject since clinical benefits for most procedures have not yet been proven. While the benefit still remains open to discussion, robotic systems are spreading and are available worldwide in tertiary centers.},

In particular, the study on younger and senior expert investigators showed that, although they interacted with the novel technology of the virtual slide in a different manner, all of them reached the objective of a "correct diagnosis". This investigation, in consideration of the effectiveness of the digital cytology, also showed other indirect and tangible cost-beneft and quantitative advantages.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) remains a common cause of disability, death and hospital admission. Several investigations support the usefulness of programs of disease management for improving clinical outcomes. However, the effect of home-based telemanagement programs on the rate of hospital readmission is still unclear and the cost-effectiveness ratio of such programs is unknown. The aim of the study was to determine whether a home-based telemanagement (HBT) programme in CHF patients decreased hospital readmissions and hospital costs in comparison with the usual care (UC) follow-up programme over a one-year period.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Four hundred-sixty CHF patients (pts), aged 57+/-10 years were randomised to two management strategies: 230 pts to HBT programme and 230 pts to UC programme. The HBT pts received a portable device, transferring, by telephone, a one-lead trace to a receiving station where a nurse was available for interactive teleconsultation. The UC pts were referred to their primary care physicians and cardiologists. The primary objective of the study was one-year hospital readmission for cardiovascular reasons. During one-year follow-up 55 pts (24\%) in HBT group and 83 pts (36\%) in UC group had at least one readmission (RR=0.56; 95\% CI: 0.38-0.82; p=0.01). After adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics, the HBT group had a significantly lower risk of readmission compared with the UC group (HR=0.50, 95\% CI: 0.34-0.73; p=0.01). The intervention was associated with a 36\% decrease in the total number of hospital readmissions (HBT group: 91 readmissions; UC group: 142 readmissions) and a 31\% decrease in the total number of episodes of hemodynamic instability (101 in HBT group vs 147 in UC group). The rate of hearth failure-related readmission was 19\% (43 pts) in HBT group and 32\% (73 pts) in UC group (RR=0.49, 95\% [CI]: 0.31-0.76; p=0.0001). No significant difference was found on cardiovascular mortality between groups. Mean cost for hospital readmission was significantly lower in HBT group (euro 843+/-1733) than in UC group (euro 1298+/-2322), (-35\%, p{\textless}0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that one-year HBT programme reduce hospital readmissions and costs in CHF patients.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Suicide is a major public health problem and its human, emotional, and economic costs are significant. Individuals in rural areas are at highest risk for suicide. However, telemedicine services are typically not rendered to individuals who are actively suicidal. The goals of the current study were to identify the risks of using telemedicine for mental healthcare from the perspective of licensed mental health providers and to determine factors associated with the use of telemedicine with patients who are at high risk for suicide.
METHODS: A total of 52 licensed mental health providers were recruited online through several professional organization listservs and targeted emails. Providers completed online questionnaires regarding demographics, caseload of suicidal patients, perceived risks for using telemedicine with patients at risk for suicide, attitudes towards telemedicine, and use of telemedicine with patients at risk for suicide.
RESULTS: Three key perceived risks associated with using telemedicine were identified, including assessment, lack of control over patient, and difficulties triaging patients if needed. It was also found that individuals who had more positive attitudes towards telemedicine, younger providers, and more experienced providers were more likely to use telemedicine with patients who are at high risk for suicide.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the perceived risks and use of telemedicine with patients at high risk for suicide. It is essential to continue this line of research to develop protocols for the provision of evidence-based therapy via telemedicine for this high-risk group.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The histologic diagnosis of skin lesions in the developing world is complicated by the shortage of pathologists with subspecialty training in dermatopathology, limited access to ancillary diagnostic testing, and costly referrals for expert glass slide consultation in challenging cases.
OBJECTIVE: In this study we evaluate the feasibility of a static-image telepathology platform in Africa for performing accurate dermatopathology consultations.
METHODS: A static-image telepathology platform using the iPath server was utilized by referring pathologists in 4 African hospitals. Diagnostic interpretations were provided by Massachusetts General Hospital dermatopathologists at no cost. The diagnostic accuracy and interobserver correlation was evaluated.
RESULTS: The static histopathologic images were diagnostic in 22 of 29 (76\%) cases. Diagnostic accuracy between static image and glass slide diagnosis in 22 cases was 91\%, ranging from 86\% to 95\% according to years of dermatopathology subspecialty expertise. Comparison with the glass slides showed that the telepathology diagnosis was limited by inappropriate field selection in only one case. Interobserver concordance between two pathologists was high (K = 0.86) suggesting that this platform is easy to use with minimal training of both referring and consulting pathologists.
LIMITATIONS: Concordance between conventional microscopy and static image telepathology was performed in 22 of 29 cases for which glass slides were received. Interobserver concordance was performed for two pathologists.
CONCLUSION: Static-image telepathology is a feasible means of rendering diagnoses on dermatopathology cases and is a cost-effective technology for obtaining much-needed second opinions in resource-poor settings.},

BACKGROUND: There has been a long-standing hope that telehealth could be used to reduce rural patients' travel times to specialty physicians. Medicare covers telehealth services provided through live, interactive videoconferencing between a beneficiary located at a certified rural site and a distant practitioner.
METHODS: We analyzed 100\% of telehealth Medicare claims for 2009 matched to individual patient ZIP codes and individual provider characteristics.
RESULTS: Despite increases in Medicare payment rates for telehealth services, expansions of covered services, reductions in provider requirements, and provisions of federal grants to encourage telehealth, growth in adoption of telehealth among providers has been modest. Medicare claims indicate that only 369 providers had 10 or more Medicare telehealth consultations in 2009. Roughly half of the 369 were mental health professionals, and about one-in-five of the 369 were non-physician professionals (e.g., physician assistants and nurse practitioners). On balance, the strong areas of telehealth are mental health and, surprisingly, nonphysician professionals. The comparative advantage of mental health could be the verbal (rather than physical contact) nature of mental health care, and the comparative advantage of non-physician professionals could be their lower labor costs.},

	abstract = {Bees are very important for terrestrial ecosystems and, above all, for the subsistence of many crops, due to their ability to pollinate flowers. Currently, the honey bee populations are decreasing due to colony collapse disorder (CCD). The reasons for CCD are not fully known, and as a result, it is essential to obtain all possible information on the environmental conditions surrounding the beehives. On the other hand, it is important to carry out such information gathering as non-intrusively as possible to avoid modifying the bees' work conditions and to obtain more reliable data. We designed a wireless-sensor networks meet these requirements. We designed a remote monitoring system (called WBee) based on a hierarchical three-level model formed by the wireless node, a local data server, and a cloud data server. WBee is a low-cost, fully scalable, easily deployable system with regard to the number and types of sensors and the number of hives and their geographical distribution. WBee saves the data in each of the levels if there are failures in communication. In addition, the nodes include a backup battery, which allows for further data acquisition and storage in the event of a power outage. Unlike other systems that monitor a single point of a hive, the system we present monitors and stores the temperature and relative humidity of the beehive in three different spots. Additionally, the hive is continuously weighed on a weighing scale. Real-time weight measurement is an innovation in wireless beehive-monitoring systems. We designed an adaptation board to facilitate the connection of the sensors to the node. Through the Internet, researchers and beekeepers can access the cloud data server to find out the condition of their hives in real time.},

Nonetheless, to allow their diffusion in National Health Care Systems (NHCSs) specific methodologies of health technology assessment (HTA) should be used to assess the standardization, the overall quality, the interoperability, the addressing to legal, economic and cost benefit aspects. One of the limits to the diffusion of the digital tele-echocardiography (T-E) applications in the NHCS lacking of a specific methodology for the HTA. In the present study, a solution offering a structured HTA of T-E products was designed. The methodology assured also the definition of standardized quality levels for the application. The first level represents the minimum level of acceptance; the other levels are accessory levels useful for a more accurate assessment of the product. The methodology showed to be useful to rationalize the process of standardization and has received a high degree of acceptance by the subjects involved in the study.},

	abstract = {Retinal fundus images acquired with nonmydriatic digital fundus cameras are versatile tools for the diagnosis of various retinal diseases. Because of the ease of use of newer camera models and their relatively low cost, these cameras can be employed by operators with limited training for telemedicine or point-of-care (PoC) applications. We propose a novel technique that uses uncalibrated multiple-view fundus images to analyze the swelling of the macula. This innovation enables the detection and quantitative measurement of swollen areas by remote ophthalmologists. This capability is not available with a single image and prone to error with stereo fundus cameras. We also present automatic algorithms to measure features from the reconstructed image, which are useful in PoC automated diagnosis of early macular edema, e.g., before the appearance of exudation. The technique presented is divided into three parts: first, a preprocessing technique simultaneously enhances the dark microstructures of the macula and equalizes the image; second, all available views are registered using nonmorphological sparse features; finally, a dense pyramidal optical flow is calculated for all the images and statistically combined to build a naive height map of the macula. Results are presented on three sets of synthetic images and two sets of real-world images. These preliminary tests show the ability to infer a minimum swelling of 300 μm and to correlate the reconstruction with the swollen location.},

	doi = {10.4103/2153-3539.109867},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Mosaics of Whole Slides (WS) are a valuable resource for pathologists to have the whole sample available at high resolution. The WS mosaic provides pathologists with an overview of the whole sample at a glance, helping them to make a reliable diagnosis. Despite recent solutions exist for creating WS mosaics based, for instance, on automated microscopes with motorized stages or WS scanner, most of the histopathology analysis are still performed in laboratories endowed with standard manual stage microscopes. Nowadays, there are lots of dedicated devices and hardware to achieve WS automatically and in batch, but only few of them are conceived to work tightly connected with a microscope and none of them is capable of working in real-time with common light microscopes. However, there is a need of having low-cost yet effective mosaicing applications even in small laboratories to improve routine histopathological analyses or to perform remote diagnoses.
AIMS: The purpose of this work is to study and develop a real-time mosaicing algorithm working even using non-automated microscopes, to enable pathologists to achieve WS while moving the holder manually, without exploiting any dedicated device. This choice enables pathologists to build WS in real-time, while browsing the sample as they are accustomed to, helping them to identify, locate, and digitally annotate lesions fast.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our method exploits fast feature tracker and frame to frame registration that we implemented on common graphics processing unit cards. The system work with common light microscopes endowed with a digital camera and connected to a commodity personal computer.
RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The system has been tested on several histological samples to test the effectiveness of the algorithm to work with mosaicing having different appearances as far as brightness, contrast, texture, and detail levels are concerned, attaining sub-pixel registration accuracy at real-time interactive rates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence of oral delivery in cancer therapeutics is expected to result in an increased need for better coordination between all treatment stakeholders, mainly to ensure adequate treatment delivery to the patient. There is significant interest in the nurse navigation program's potential to improve transitions of care by improving communication between treatment stakeholders and by providing personalized organizational assistance to patients. The use of health information technology is another strategy aimed at improving cancer care coordination that can be combined with the NN program to improve remote patient follow-up. However, the potential of these two strategies combined to improve oral treatment delivery is limited by a lack of rigorous evidence of actual impact.
METHODS/DESIGN: We are conducting a large scale randomized controlled trial designed to assess the impact of a navigation program denoted CAPRI that is based on two Nurse Navigators and a web portal ensuring coordination between community and hospital as well as between patients and navigators, versus routine delivery of oral anticancer therapy. The primary research aim is to assess the impact of the program on treatment delivery for patients with metastatic cancer, as measured by Relative Dose Intensity. The trial involves a number of other outcomes, including tumor response, survival, toxic side effects, patient quality of life and patient experience An economic evaluation adopting a societal perspective will be conducted, in order to estimate those health. care resources' used. A parallel process evaluation will be conducted to describe implementation of the intervention.
DISCUSSION: If the CAPRI program does improve treatment delivery, the evidence on its economic impact will offer important knowledge for health decision-makers, helping develop new follow-up services for patients receiving oral chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy. The process evaluation will determine the best conditions in which such a program might be implemented.

We explore the possibility of patients and/or their partners performing their own vaginal sonographies at home.

A simplification of the uncontested need to perform these sonographies, even if applicable to just a selected proportion of IVF patients, could fit in the general tendency to make IVF more patient centred and friendly, to implement telemedicine and to increase patient empowerment by supervised active participation to their treatment. The advantages of such a technology are explored in this paper, aiming at opening up a debate on whether patients themselves would, could and should achieve a further substantial simplification of ART without loss of quality while strongly curbing costs.},

	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Does self-operated endovaginal telemonitoring (SOET) of the ovarian stimulation phase in IVF/ICSI produce similar laboratory, clinical, patient reported and health-economic results as traditional monitoring (non-SOET)?
SUMMARY ANSWER: SOET is not inferior to traditional monitoring (non-SOET).
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Monitoring the follicular phase is needed to adapt gonadotrophin dose, detect threatening hyperstimulation and plan HCG administration. Currently, patients pay visits to care providers, entailing transportation costs and productivity loss. It stresses patients, partners, care providers and the environment. Patients living at great distance from centres have more difficult access to treatment. The logistics and stress during the follicular phase of assisted reproduction treatment (ART) is often an impediment for treatment.
STUDY DESIGNS, SIZE, DURATION: The study was a non-inferiority RCT between SOET and non-SOET performed between February 2012 and October 2013. Sample size calculations of number of metaphase II (MII) oocytes (the primary outcome): 81 patients were needed in each study arm for sufficient statistical power. Block randomization was used with allocation concealment through electronic files. The first sonogram was requested after 5 days of stimulation, after that mostly every 2 days and with a daily sonograms at the end.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS: Inclusion criteria were age {\textless}41 years, undergoing ICSI, no poor response and having two ovaries. We used a small laptop with USB connected vaginal probe and developed a specific web site application. Sonographic training was given to all women at the initiation of a treatment attempt at the centre. The website contained demonstration material consisting of still images and video sequences, as well as written instructions regarding the use of the instrument and probe handling. In total, 185 eligible patients were recruited in four centres: 123 were randomized; 121 completed SOET (n = 59) or non-SOET (n = 62), and 62/185 (33\%) eligible patients declined participation for various reasons.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Patient characteristics were comparable. The clinical results showed similar conception rates (P = 0.47) and ongoing pregnancy rates (SOET: 15/59 = 25\%; non-SOET: 16/62 = 26\%) (P = 1.00) were obtained. Similar numbers of follicles {\textgreater}15 mm diameter at oocyte retrieval (OR), ova at OR, MII oocytes, log2 MII oocytes, embryos available at transfer, top quality embryos and embryos frozen were obtained in the two groups, indicating non-inferiority of SOET monitoring. Regarding patient-reported outcomes, a significantly higher contentedness of patient and partner (P {\textless} 0.01), a higher feeling of empowerment, discretion and more active partner participation (P {\textless} 0.001) as well as a trend towards less stress (P = 0.06) were observed in the S versus the NS group. In the economic analysis, the use of SOET led to reduced productivity loss, lower transportation costs, and lower sonogram and consultation costs (all P {\textless} 0.001 but higher personnel cost than NS).
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The study was stopped (no further funding) before full sample size was reached. There were also a few cases of unexpected poor response, leading to a wider SD than anticipated in the power calculation. However, although the study was underpowered for these reasons, non-inferiority of SOET versus non-SOET was demonstrated.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Home monitoring using SOET may provide a patient-centred alternative to the standard methods. ART sonograms can be made, and then sent to the care provider for analysis at any appropriate time and from anywhere if an internet connection is available. This approach offers several advantages for patients as well as care providers, including similar results to the traditional methods with less logistical stress and potentially bringing care to patients in poor resource settings.

Eighteen of 19 patients followed up after ITX or modified multivisceral transplantation (MMVTX) in conventional outpatient clinics in Oxford agreed to attend additional Skype clinics. All patients who were followed up through Skype clinics after ITX/MMVTX received a questionnaire to measure their satisfaction with methods and technical aspects of videoconferencing as well as time/mode of traveling, travel expenses/costs, waiting time in outpatient clinic and patients' satisfaction. Mean travel distance to Oxford was 236 ± 168 miles, mean travel time was 277 ± 175 min, and mean travel cost was 200 ± 56 Great Britain Pounds.

Patients with disabilities may not travel well or tolerate changes in routine so may not have access to psychiatry. Utilization of telepsychiatry is well suited to this specialized patient population because it allows a highly traumatized group to meet with a psychiatrist and other mental health professionals from a location of their choice.

Experimental tests, for a total of 65 mimicked fall incidents, recorded with 16 human subjects (14 men and two women) that have been monitored for 320 min, have been used to validate the proposed system under real circumstances. The subjects' weight is between 55 and 90 kg with heights between 1.65 and 1.82 m, while their age is between 25 and 39 years. The experimental results have shown a sensitivity to detect the fall events in real time of 100\% without reporting false positives.

METHODS: In this prospective study utilizing telemedicine technology in the NICU for daily patient bedside rounds ('tele-rounds'), twenty pairs of neonates were matched according to gestational age, diagnoses, and disease severity. One patient was cared for by the on-site NICU team lead by an on-site neonatologist. The other patient was cared for by the on-site team but led by an off-site neonatologist using a remote-controlled robot. Patient rounding data, clinical outcomes, length of stay, and hospital costs were compared between the two groups. Parents and staff were also surveyed about their satisfaction with telemedicine.
RESULTS: Except for one parameter, no significant differences in care or outcomes were found between patients cared for by either neonatologist. The exception was the time the off-site neonatologist spent on the patient encounter compared to the on-site neonatologist (median [interquartile range]), (5 minutes [5, 6] vs. 8 minutes [7, 10.5], p = 0.002). This difference was due primarily to time needed to operate and maneuver the robot or occasionally to slower or dropped connection to the Internet. There were positive perceptions of telemedicine among both parents and NICU staff.
CONCLUSION: As long as direct bedside care providers are available, remote-controlled, robotic telemedicine technology can be utilized by neonatologists to perform daily patient rounds in the neonatal intensive care unit.},

More providers are moving towards remote patient monitoring, which reduces the length of hospital stays and frees up their physicians and nurses for acute cases and helps them to tackle staff shortages. Physiological sensors are commonly used in many human specialties e.g. electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes, for monitoring heart signals, and electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes, for sensing the electrical activity of the brain, are the most well-known applications. Consequently there is a substantial unmet need for physiological sensors that can be simply and easily applied by the patient or primary carer, are comfortable to wear, can accurately sense parameters over long periods of time and can be connected to data recording systems using Bluetooth technology. We have developed a small, battery powered, user customizable portable monitor. This prototype is capable of recording three-axial body acceleration, skin temperature, and has up to four bio analogical front ends. Moreover, it is also able of continuous wireless transmission to any Bluetooth device including a PDA or a cellular phone. The bio-front end can use long-lasting dry electrodes or novel textile electrodes that can be embedded in clothes. The device can be powered by a standard mobile phone which has a Ni-MH 3.6 V battery, to sustain more than seven days continuous functioning when using the Bluetooth Sniff mode to reduce TX power.

	abstract = {Digital health constitutes a merger of both software and hardware technology with health care delivery and management, and encompasses a number of domains, from wearable devices to artificial intelligence, each associated with widely disparate interaction and data collection models. In this review, we focus on the landscape of the current integration of digital health technology in cancer care by subdividing digital health technologies into the following sections: connected devices, digital patient information collection, telehealth, and digital assistants. In these sections, we give an overview of the potential clinical impact of such technologies as they pertain to key domains, including patient education, patient outcomes, quality of life, and health care value. We performed a search of PubMed ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed ) and www.ClinicalTrials.gov for numerous terms related to digital health technologies, including digital health, connected devices, smart devices, wearables, activity trackers, connected sensors, remote monitoring, electronic surveys, electronic patient-reported outcomes, telehealth, telemedicine, artificial intelligence, chatbot, and digital assistants. The terms health care and cancer were appended to the previously mentioned terms to filter results for cancer-specific applications. From these results, studies were included that exemplified use of the various domains of digital health technologies in oncologic care. Digital health encompasses the integration of a vast array of technologies with health care, each associated with varied methods of data collection and information flow. Integration of these technologies into clinical practice has seen applications throughout the spectrum of care, including cancer screening, on-treatment patient management, acute post-treatment follow-up, and survivorship. Implementation of these systems may serve to reduce costs and workflow inefficiencies, as well as to improve overall health care value, patient outcomes, and quality of life.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: On a background of high rates of severe otitis media (OM) with associated hearing loss, children from the Torres Strait and Cape York region requiring ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery, faced waiting times exceeding three years. After numerous clinical safety incidents were raised, indicating a failure of the current system to deliver appropriate care, the governing Hospital and Health service opted to deliver surgical care through an alternate process. ENT surgeries were performed on 16 consented children from two remote locations via the private health care system, funded by a health provider partnership.
METHODS: We examined the collaboration processes alongside clinical findings from this ENT surgery. Collated patient data, included patient demographics, clinical and audiometry presentation features were reviewed and compared pre and post-operatively. Cost savings associated with the use of TeleHealth post-operatively were briefly examined.
RESULTS: Surgeries were successfully completed in all 16 children. The reported mean waitlist time for ENT surgery was 1.2 years. Pre-surgery pure-tone average hearing thresholds were reported at left: 30.9 dB, right: 38.2 dB. The majority of presentations were for bilateral OM with Effusion (69\%). Post-surgical follow up indicated successful clinical outcomes in 80\% of patients and successful hearing outcomes in 88\% of patients. Mean difference pure-tone average hearing thresholds, left: 8.4 dB and right: 11.2 dB. Furthermore, the majority of patients reported improved hearing and breathing. The use of TeleHealth for post-operative review enabled a minimum cost saving of AUD\$21,664 for these 16 children. Overall, a high level of staffing resources was required to successfully coordinate this intense surgical activity.
CONCLUSION: This innovative approach to a health system crisis enabled successful ENT surgical and hearing outcomes in 16 children, whose waitlisted time grossly exceeded state health recommendations. Using private health facilities funded by a health partnership, while unlikely to be a suitable model of care for routine service delivery; may be applied as an adjunct service model when blockages and delays lead to sub-standard service provision. This approach may be applicable to other health care facilities when facing extended elective surgery wait times in ENT or other specialty areas.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE, AIMS, AND OBJECTIVES: This costing evaluation compares three service delivery models for ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgery for remote living Indigenous children to improve their hearing outcomes, with the aim to identify the least costly model.
METHODS: The main outcome measure presented was the incremental cost difference between the base case (Model 1) and two alternative models (Model 2, 3). The costs in 2017 Australian dollars are assessed from two viewpoints: (1) health system perspective, and (2) patients and their families including travel out-of-pocket expenses, presented separately according to the funding source.
RESULTS: Findings indicate that the least costly model offered low-risk ENT surgery from a state funded hospital in a remote setting, with high use of videoconference technology: TeleHealth (Model 3) could save \$3626 to \$5067 per patient, compared with patients travelling to a regional centre public hospital (Model 1). A federally funded scheme which allowed groups of patients to access a direct flight charter transfer to the private hospital in regional centre (Model 2) reduced the cost by \$2178 to \$2711 per patient when compared with standard care (Model 1). From a societal perspective, Model 1 required out-of-pocket patient expenses, with greater time away from home, and hence appears the least preferred option.
CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity analyses also demonstrate that Model 3 would be the more economical model for providing ENT surgery for remote living children. By proving an accurate assessment of the true costs of delivering these important ear and hearing health services, strategic health service planners may be better informed and sufficient budgets can be allocated to provide improved service delivery. The benefits of Model 3, over Models 1 or 2, would also incorporate improvements to patient safety as a result of reducing patient travel, which should in-turn, reduce failure-to-attend rates.},

In these circumstances, transferring diagnostic tools and treatment options to primary care could prove beneficial for patients. To do so, the quality of medical care and the costs and benefits of the approach need to be assessed. However, the patient perspective is equally important, offering important insights.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study we investigate the satisfaction of patients toward a new teleradiology facility offered a general practice on Ameland, an island in the Netherlands. A questionnaire was created based on the Dutch version of the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire III and completed by all patients after receiving an x-ray in primary care between June 1, 2007 and June 1, 2009. Those who received more than one x-ray in that period were included only once. The technical and interpersonal skills of doctors were rated out the sum score of the questionnaire namely 25 and 30, respectively. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the differences between the means of the satisfaction subscales and the patient characteristics.
RESULTS: The response proportion was after reminder 65\% (381/587 patients). Satisfaction with the technical skills of the doctor providing the teleradiology service was 22.4 ± 3.7, while satisfaction with the interpersonal skills of the doctor during the diagnostic phase was 26.8 ± 3.8. Island residents, the elderly, and those with no history of trauma were more satisfied with the technical and interpersonal aspects of the consultation than non-residents, younger patients, and those with a history of trauma.
CONCLUSION: Patients in the island community of Ameland experienced high levels of satisfaction with the teleradiology service offered in primary care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine and standard ophthalmoscopy for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) management.
METHODS: Models were developed to represent ROP examination and treatment using telemedicine and standard ophthalmoscopy. Cost-utility analysis was performed using decision analysis, evidence-based outcome data from published literature, and present value modeling. Visual outcome data were converted to patient preference-based time trade-off utility values based on published literature. Costs of disease management were determined based on 2006 Medicare reimbursements. Costs per quality-adjusted life year gained by telemedicine and ophthalmoscopy for ROP management were compared. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed on the following variables: discount rate (0\%-7\%), incidence of treatment-requiring ROP (1\%-20\%), sensitivity and specificity of ophthalmoscopic diagnosis (75\%-100\%), percentage of readable telemedicine images (75\%-100\%), and sensitivity and specificity of telemedicine diagnosis (75\%-100\%).
RESULTS: For infants with birth weight less than 1500 g using a 3\% discount rate for costs and outcomes, the costs per quality-adjusted life year gained were \$3193 with telemedicine and \$5617 with standard ophthalmoscopy. Sensitivity analysis resulted in ranges of costs per quality-adjusted life year from \$1235 to \$18,898 for telemedicine and from \$2171 to \$27,215 for ophthalmoscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is more cost-effective than standard ophthalmoscopy for ROP management. Both strategies are highly cost-effective compared with other health care interventions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Emergency Department crowding is an increasing problem, leading to treatment delays and higher risk of mortality. Our institution recently implemented a telemedicine physician intake ("tele-intake") process as a mitigating front-end strategy. Previous studies have focused on ED throughput metrics such as door to disposition; our work aimed to specifically assess the tele-intake model for clinical accuracy.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed ED visits at a high acuity, tertiary care academic hospital before and after tele-intake implementation. We defined the primary outcome as the degree of additional laboratory, imaging, and medication orders placed by the subsequent ED provider. Our secondary outcomes were the cancellation rate of intake orders and the percentage of encounters where no additional second provider orders were necessary.
RESULTS: For in-person and tele-intake physician encounters between September 2015 and February 2017, most labs and diagnostic radiology studies, and approximately half of CT, ultrasound, and pharmacy orders were initiated by the intake physician. We found no significant difference for our primary outcome (p = 0.2449). For both tele-intake and in-person encounters, {\textless}1\% of orders were cancelled by the second provider. Additionally, 30.8\% of in-person and 31.5\% of telemedicine patient encounters required no additional orders to make a disposition decision.
DISCUSSION: This novel analysis of an innovative patient care model suggests that the benefits of tele-intake as a replacement for in-person physician directed intake are not at the cost of over or under utilization of diagnostic testing or interventions.},

	abstract = {PROBLEM: Bangladesh has yet to develop a fully integrated health information system infrastructure that is critical to guiding policy development and planning.
APPROACH: Initial pilot telemedicine and eHealth programmes were not coordinated at national level. However, in 2011, a national eHealth policy was implemented.
LOCAL SETTING: Bangladesh has made substantial improvements to its health system. However, the country still faces public health challenges with limited and inequitable access to health services and lack of adequate resources to meet the demands of the population.
RELEVANT CHANGES: In 2008, eHealth services were introduced, including computerization of health facilities at sub-district levels, internet connections, internet servers and an mHealth service for communicating with health-care providers. Health facilities at sub-district levels were provided with internet connections and servers. In 482 upazila health complexes and district hospitals, an mHealth service was set-up where an on-duty doctor is available for patients at all hours to provide consultations by mobile phone. A government operated telemedicine service was initiated and by 2014, 43 fully equipped centres were in service. These centres provide medical consultations by qualified physicians to patients visiting rural and remote community clinics and union health centres.
LESSONS LEARNT: Despite early pilot interventions and successful implementation, progress in adopting eHealth strategies in Bangladesh has been slow. There is a lack of common standards on information technology for health, which causes difficulties in data management and sharing among different databases. Limited internet bandwidth and the high cost of infrastructure and software development are barriers to adoption of these technologies.},

In this compact tomographic imaging platform (weighing only ∼110 grams), 24 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that are each butt-coupled to a fibre-optic waveguide are controlled through a cost-effective micro-processor to sequentially illuminate the sample from different angles to record lensfree holograms of the sample that is placed on the top of a digital sensor array. In order to generate pixel super-resolved (SR) lensfree holograms and hence digitally improve the achievable lateral resolution, multiple sub-pixel shifted holograms are recorded at each illumination angle by electromagnetically actuating the fibre-optic waveguides using compact coils and magnets. These SR projection holograms obtained over an angular range of ±50° are rapidly reconstructed to yield projection images of the sample, which can then be back-projected to compute tomograms of the objects on the sensor-chip. The performance of this compact and light-weight lensfree tomographic microscope is validated by imaging micro-beads of different dimensions as well as a Hymenolepis nana egg, which is an infectious parasitic flatworm. Achieving a decent three-dimensional spatial resolution, this field-portable on-chip optical tomographic microscope might provide a useful toolset for telemedicine and high-throughput imaging applications in resource-poor settings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The application of information and communication technologies in nursing care is becoming more widespread, but few applications have been reported in neonatal care. A close monitoring of newborns within the first weeks of life is crucial to evaluating correct feeding, growth, and health status. Conventional hospital-based postdischarge monitoring could be improved in terms of costs and clinical effectiveness by using a telemedicine approach.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a new Internet-based system for monitoring low-risk newborns after discharge compared to the standard hospital-based follow-up, with specific attention to prevention of emergency department (ED) visits in the first month of life.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of two low-risk newborn patient groups. One group, born between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2011, received the standard hospital-based follow-up visit within 48 hours after discharge. After implementing an Internet-based monitoring system, another group, born between July 19, 2011, and January 19, 2012, received their follow-up with this system.
RESULTS: A total of 18 (15.8\%) out of 114 newborns who received the standard hospital-based follow-up had an ED visit in the first month of life compared with 5 (5.6\%; P=.026) out of 90 infants who were monitored by the Internet-based system. The cost of the hospital-based follow-up was 182.1€ per patient, compared with 86.1€ for the Internet-based follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Our Internet-based monitoring approach proved to be both more effective and less costly than the conventional hospital-based follow-up, particularly through reducing subsequent ED visits.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is essential in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), but adequate control is not always possible. This is clinically important because CPAP can reverse the morbidity and mortality associated with OSA. Telemedicine, with support provided via a web platform and video conferences, could represent a cost-effective alternative to standard care management.
AIM: To assess the telemedicine impact on treatment compliance, cost-effectiveness and improvement in quality of life (QoL) when compared with traditional face-to-face follow-up.
METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was performed to compare a telemedicine-based CPAP follow-up strategy with standard face-to-face management. Consecutive OSA patients requiring CPAP treatment, with sufficient internet skills and who agreed to participate, were enrolled. They were followed-up at 1, 3 and 6 months and answered surveys about sleep, CPAP side effects and lifestyle. We compared CPAP compliance, cost-effectiveness and QoL between the beginning and the end of the study. A Bayesian cost-effectiveness analysis with non-informative priors was performed.
RESULTS: We randomised 139 patients. At 6 months, we found similar levels of CPAP compliance, and improved daytime sleepiness, QoL, side effects and degree of satisfaction in both groups. Despite requiring more visits, the telemedicine group was more cost-effective: costs were lower and differences in effectiveness were not relevant.
CONCLUSIONS: A telemedicine-based strategy for the follow-up of CPAP treatment in patients with OSA was as effective as standard hospital-based care in terms of CPAP compliance and symptom improvement, with comparable side effects and satisfaction rates. The telemedicine-based strategy had lower total costs due to savings on transport and less lost productivity (indirect costs).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whole slide imaging (WSI) makes it possible to capture images of an entire histological slide. WSI has established roles in surgical pathology, including support of off-site frozen section interpretation, primary diagnosis, educational activities, and laboratory quality assurance (QA) activities. Analyses of the cost of WSI have traditionally been based solely on direct costs and diagnostic accuracy; however, these types of analyses largely ignore workflow and cost issues that arise as a result of redundancy, the need for additional staffing, and customized software development when WSI is integrated into routine diagnostic surgical pathology. The pre-scan, scan, and post-scan costs; quality control and QA costs; and IT process costs can be significant, and consequently, pathology groups can find it difficult to perform a realistic cost-benefit analysis of adding WSI to their practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this paper, we report a "value added" approach developed to guide our decisions regarding integration of WSI into surgical pathology practice. The approach focuses on specific operational measures (cost, time, and enhanced patient care) and practice settings (clinical, education, and research) to identify routine activities in which the addition of WSI can provide improvements.
RESULTS: When applied to our academic pathology group practice, the value added approach resulted in expanded and improved operations, as demonstrated by outcome based measures.
CONCLUSION: A value added can be used to perform a realistic cost-benefit analysis of integrating WSI into routine surgical pathology practice.},

However typical large systems are bulky, expensive, and afford limited angular motion, while smaller designs suffer complications arising from limited motion range, speed, and force generation. This work was to develop and validate a simple, compact, low cost single site teleoperated laparoendoscopic surgical robotic system, with demonstrated capability to carry out basic surgical procedures.
METHODS: This system builds upon previous work done at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and includes instrument and endoscope manipulators as well as compact articulated instruments designed to overcome single incision geometry complications. A robotic endoscope holder was used for the base, with an added support frame for teleoperated manipulators and instruments fabricated mostly from 3D printed parts. Kinematics and control methods were formulated for the novel manipulator configuration.
RESULTS: Trajectory following results from an optical motion tracker and sample task performance results are presented.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the system has successfully met the goal of basic surgical functionality while minimizing physical size, complexity, and cost.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare costs of 2 screening modalities for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP): telemedicine imaging with remote interpretation versus in-person binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy (BIO).
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
PARTICIPANTS: Infants from an existing telemedicine screening program at 2 cities in Ontario, Canada.
METHODS: We conducted a cost analysis comparison from the perspective of the Ministry of Health. Patient level data was used for the telemedicine group. A hypothetical control group consisted of the minimum number of BIO and interhospital transfers if the existing patients were screened in person. Costs included in-person examinations, transfers, setting up, and ongoing costs of telemedicine screening. Costs were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and are reported in 2014 Canadian dollars.
RESULTS: A total of 102 and 72 infants were screened from Sudbury and Barrie, respectively; 3\% and 2\% of infants in the telemedicine group were transferred for BIO from Sudbury and Barrie, respectively. All infants in the control group would have required at least one transfer for BIO. The average total cost per eye examination was \$4855 ± \$5616 and \$4540 ± \$3129 for the telemedicine group and \$19 834 ± \$13 814 and \$2429 ± \$1664 for the control group from Sudbury and Barrie, respectively (p {\textless} 0.001). Interhospital transfer cost for the control group was \$19 489 ± \$13 605 and \$2055 ± \$1471 compared to \$635 ± \$3968 and \$30 ± \$197 for the telemedicine group (p {\textless} 0.001) in Sudbury and Barrie, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine appears to be an economically attractive option depending on the location and number of infants screened. This information is useful for planning similar ROP screening programs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Growing evidence that patient engagement improves health outcomes and reduces health care costs has fueled health providers' focus on patient portals as the primary access point for personal health information and patient-provider communication. Whereas much attention has been given to identifying characteristics of older adults who do and do not adopt patient portals and necessary adaptions to portal design, little is known about their attitudes and perceptions regarding patient portal use as a tool for engagement in their health care within the context of health literacy, experience navigating Web-based health information, and previous patient portal use.
OBJECTIVE: The specific aims of this study were to explore attitudes toward portal adoption and its perceived usefulness as a tool for health care engagement among adults (65 years and older) who have varying levels of health literacy and degrees of prior patient portal use.
METHODS: A phone survey of 100 community dwelling adults gathered sociodemographic, health, and technology related information. Older adults were purposefully selected for 4 follow-up focus groups based on survey responses to health literacy and previous patient portal use. A mixed-method approach was used to integrate phone survey data with thematic analysis of 4 focus groups. Due to variability in attitudes between focus group participants, an individual case analysis was performed and thematic patterns were used as the basis for subgroup formation.
RESULTS: Differences in health literacy, comfort navigating health information on the Web, and previous portal experience explained some but not all differences related to the 7 themes that emerged in the focus groups analysis. Individual cases who shared attitudes were arranged into 5 subgroups from least to most able and willing to engage in health care via a patient portal. The subgroups' overall portal adoption attitudes were: (1) Don't want to feel pushed into anything, (2) Will only adopt if required, (3) Somebody needs to help me, (4) See general convenience of the portal for simple tasks and medical history, but prefer human contact for questions, and (5) Appreciates current features and excited about new possibilities .
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the older adults are interested in using a patient portal regardless of health literacy level, previous patient portal adoption, or experience navigating health information on the Web. Research targeting informal caregivers of older adults who are unable or unwilling to engage with information technology in health care on their own is warranted. Health care organizations should consider tailored strategies to meet the needs of older adults (and their informal caregivers) and explore alternative workflows that integrate patient portal information into phone conversations and face-to-face contact with health care providers.},

There is, however, need for a practicable multilevel monitoring solution, encompassing relevant outputs involved in the pathophysiology of chemotherapy-induced toxicity. Domomedicine embraces the delivery of complex care and medical procedures at the patient's home based on modern technologies, and thus it offers an integrated approach for increasing the safety of cancer patients on chemotherapy.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate patient compliance and clinical relevance of a novel integrated multiparametric telemonitoring domomedicine platform in cancer patients receiving multidrug chemotherapy at home.
METHODS: Self-measured body weight, self-rated symptoms using the 19-item MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), and circadian rest-activity rhythm recording with a wrist accelerometer (actigraph) were transmitted daily by patients to a server via the Internet, using a dedicated platform installed at home. Daily body weight changes, individual MDASI scores, and relative percentage of activity in-bed versus out-of-bed (I{\textless}O) were computed. Chemotherapy was administered according to the patient medical condition. Compliance was evaluated according to the proportions of (1) patient-days with all data available (full) and (2) patient-days with at least one parameter available (minimal). Acceptability was assessed using the Whole Systems Demonstrator Service User Technology Acceptability Questionnaire. Linear discriminant analysis was used to identify the combination of parameters associated with subsequent unplanned hospitalization.
RESULTS: A total of 31 patients (males: 55\% [17/31]; World Health Organization Performance Status=0: 29\% (9/31); age range: 35-91 years) participated for a median of 58 days (38-313). They received a total of 102 chemotherapy courses (64.7\% as outpatients). Overall full compliance was 59.7\% (522/874), with at least one data available for 830/874 patient-days (95.0\%), during the 30-day per-protocol span. Missing data rates were similar for each parameter. Patients were altogether satisfied with the use of the platform. Ten toxicity-related hospitalizations occurred in 6 patients. The combination of weighted circadian function (actigraphy parameter I{\textless}O), body weight change, and MDASI scores predicted for ensuing emergency hospitalization within 3 days, with an accuracy of 94\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Multidimensional daily telemonitoring of body weight, circadian rest-activity rhythm, and patient-reported symptoms was feasible, satisfactory, and clinically relevant in patients on chemotherapy. This domomedicine platform constitutes a unique tool for the further development of safe home-based chemotherapy administration.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Veterans with low vision who live in rural communities have limited access to low-vision rehabilitation services, unless they are able to travel several miles to a specialty low-vision clinic. A low-vision optometry telerehabilitation evaluation is a thorough assessment of patient's functional vision. Following each low-vision optometry telerehabilitation evaluation is a low-vision telerehabilitation initial assessment with a blind rehabilitation therapist. Our objective was to estimate the acceptance and practicality of low-vision telerehabilitation and investigate the travel cost and time savings.
METHODS: Utilizing Google Maps™, round-trip travel mileage and travel time can be estimated between the veteran's home and the Buffalo Veterans Affairs (VA) and compared with the round-trip mileage and travel time between the veteran's home and local community-based outpatient center (CBOC) or local VA for low-vision telerehabilitation services. The difference is the savings in travel miles and time. Cost saving can be calculated by multiplying difference in travel miles by cost per mile.
RESULTS: Veterans who chose not to schedule face-to-face low-vision rehabilitation at the Buffalo VA due to an average round-trip travel distance of 151 miles scheduled a low-vision telerehabilitation at a local CBOC or local VA with an average round-trip travel distance of 29 miles. Adding low-vision telerehabilitation services from fiscal year (FY) 13 to FY 17 resulted in a 24\% increase in low-vision patient care. The median saving of travel miles for rural veterans was 122 miles per veteran, and the median saving of travel time was 2.09 h per veteran. Overall, the median saving of the travel cost was \$65.29 per veteran.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows and supports low-vision telerehabilitation as an accepted, practical, time-saving, and cost-saving alternative option to traditional face-to-face consultations with a low-vision optometrist and blind rehabilitation therapist.},

With the help of video conferencing systems, a so-called neuromedical teleconsultation is carried out. Methods. The study included a multicentered, completely standardized survey of physicians in hospitals by means of a computerized on-line questionnaire. Descriptive statistical methods were used for data analysis. Results. 119 acute hospitals without neurology departments were included in the study. The most important reasons for participating in a teleneuromedical network is seen as the improvement in the quality of treatment (82\%), the ability to avoid unnecessary patient transport (76\%), easier and faster access to stroke expertise (72\%) as well as better competitiveness among medical services (67\%). The most significant problem areas are the financing system of teleneuromedicine with regard to the acquisition costs of the technical equipment (43\%) and the compensation for the stroke-unit center with the specialists' consultation service (31\%) as well as legal aspects of teleneuromedicine (27\%). Conclusions. This investigation showed that there is a high acceptance for teleneuromedicine among co-operating hospitals. However these facilities have goals in addition to improved quality in stroke treatment. Therefore the use of teleneuromedicine must be also associated with long term incentives for the overall health care system, particularly since the implementation of a teleneuromedicine network system is time consuming and associated with high implementation costs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Digital health technologies, including telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth), and remote monitoring, are playing a greater role in medical practice. Safe and accurate management of medical information leads to the advancement of digital health, which in turn results in a number of beneficial effects. Furthermore, mHealth can help lower costs by facilitating the delivery of care and connecting people to their health care providers. Mobile apps help empower patients and health care providers to proactively address medical conditions through near real-time monitoring and treatment, regardless of the location of the patient or the health care provider. Additionally, mHealth data are stored in servers, and consequently, data management that prevents all forms of manipulation is crucial for both medical practice and clinical trials.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a tamper-resistant mHealth system using blockchain technology, which enables trusted and auditable computing using a decentralized network.
METHODS: We developed an mHealth system for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia using a smartphone app. The volunteer data collected with the app were stored in JavaScript Object Notation format and sent to the blockchain network. Thereafter, we evaluated the tamper resistance of the data against the inconsistencies caused by artificial faults.
RESULTS: Electronic medical records collected using smartphones were successfully sent to a private Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network. We verified the data update process under conditions where all the validating peers were running normally. The mHealth data were successfully updated under network faults. We further ensured that any electronic health record registered to the blockchain network was resistant to tampering and revision. The mHealth data update was compatible with tamper resistance in the blockchain network.
CONCLUSIONS: Blockchain serves as a tamperproof system for mHealth. Combining mHealth with blockchain technology may provide a novel solution that enables both accessibility and data transparency without a third party such as a contract research organization.},

Developing models of geriatric emergency care, including some that are already in use at dedicated geriatric EDs, incorporate a variety of physical, procedural, and staffing changes.

By transforming their current safety-net role to becoming a partner in care coordination, EDs have the opportunity to become better integrated into the broader health care system, improve patient health outcomes, contribute to optimizing the health care system, and reduce overall costs of care-keys to improving emergency care for patients of all ages.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whilst home-based telerehabilitation has been shown non-inferior to traditional centre-based rehabilitation in patients with chronic heart failure, its economic sustainability remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the cost-utility of a home-based telerehabilitation program.
METHODS: A comparative, trial-based, incremental cost-utility analysis was conducted from a health care provider's perspective. We collected data as part of a multi-centre, two-arm, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial with 6 months follow-up. There were 53 participants randomised to either a telerehabilitation program (consisting of 12 weeks of group-based exercise and education delivered into the home via online videoconferencing) or a traditional centre-based program. Health care costs (including personnel, equipment and hospital readmissions due to heart failure) were extracted from health system records, and calculated in Australian dollars using 2013 as the base year. Health utilities were measured using the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Estimates were presented as means and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) based on bootstrapping. Costs and utility differences were plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane.
RESULTS: Total health care costs per participant were significantly lower in the telerehabilitation group (-\$1,590, 95\% CI: -2,822, -359) during the 6 months. No significant differences in quality-adjusted life years (0, 95\% CI: -0.06, 0.05) were seen between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Heart failure telerehabilitation appears to be less costly and as effective for the health care provider as traditional centre-based rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Riata and Riata ST defibrillator leads (St. Jude Medical, Sylmar, California) were recalled in 2011 due to increased risk of insulation failure leading to externalized cables. Fluoroscopic screening can identify insulation failure, although the relation between mechanical failure and electrical failure is unclear. At the time of the recall, the University of Virginia developed a screening program, including fluoroscopic evaluation, education sessions, device interrogation, and remote monitoring for patients with this defibrillator lead. The aim of this study was to review the outcomes of the screening program, including costs, which were absorbed by our institution. Costs were calculated using Medicare reimbursement estimates. Forty-eight patients participated in the screening program. At initial screening, 31\% were found to have evidence of insulation failure but electrical function was normal in all leads. The cost of this program was \$35,358.72. The cost per diagnosis of mechanical lead failure was \$2,357.25. During 2 years of follow-up, 1 patient experienced Riata lead electrical failure without fluoroscopic evidence of insulation failure. Patients were more likely to have a lead revision if there was evidence of insulation failure. Lead revisions occurred at the time of generator change in 88\% of patients with insulation failure but in only 14\% of patients with a fluoroscopically normal lead (p = 0.04). The cost of recall-related defibrillator lead revisions was \$81,704.55. In conclusion, our Riata screening program added expense without clear benefit to patients. In fact, patients may have been put at more risk by undergoing defibrillator lead revisions based solely on the results of the fluoroscopic screening.},

Do you want a final reading from an attending radiologist (known as a consultant radiologist in many countries) or would you be satisfied with a preliminary reading from a teleradiology provider and a final reading from your own in-house radiologist the following day? Do you simply require after-hours coverage or do you need to supplement the coverage provided by your own internal radiologists during normal working hours? Teleradiology is not without its drawbacks. It can add additional costs, particularly for after-hours coverage. Teleradiology rarely provides in-house coverage for procedures, and the interpreting radiologist may sometimes be difficult to contact for consultation. Choosing a teleradiology vendor requires due diligence. When the contracting entity defines its expectations well and chooses its teleradiology vendor with care, the end result will be satisfactory for all concerned, including the patients.},

Whether a fourth-generation telehealth program can reduce all-cause mortality has not yet been reported for patients with chronic cardiovascular disease.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a clinical epidemiology study retrospectively to determine whether a fourth-generation telehealth program can reduce all-cause mortality for patients with chronic cardiovascular disease.
METHODS: We enrolled 576 patients who had joined a telehealth program and compared them with 1178 control patients. A Cox proportional hazards model was fitted to analyze the impact of risk predictors on all-cause mortality. The model adjusted for age, sex, and chronic comorbidities.
RESULTS: There were 53 (9.3\%) deaths in the telehealth group and 136 (11.54\%) deaths in the control group. We found that the telehealth program violated the proportional hazards assumption by the Schoenfeld residual test. Thus, we fitted a Cox regression model with time-varying covariates. The results showed an estimated hazard ratio (HR) of 0.866 (95\% CI 0.837-0.896, P{\textless}.001; number needed to treat at 1 year=55.6, 95\% CI 43.2-75.7 based on HR of telehealth program) for the telehealth program on all-cause mortality after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. The time-varying interaction term in this analysis showed that the beneficial effect of telehealth would increase over time.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that our fourth-generation telehealth program is associated with less all-cause mortality compared with usual care after adjusting for chronic comorbidities.},

Providers are paid based on the number of services rendered instead of quality, leading to the cost of care rising at a faster rate than its value. One approach to counter this is the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH), a primary care model that emphasizes team-based medicine, a partnership between patients and providers, and expanded access and communication. The transition to PCMH is facilitated by innovative technologies, such as telemedicine for additional services, electronic medical records to document patients' health needs, and online portals for electronic visits and communication between patients and providers. Implementing these technologies involves tremendous investment of funds and time from practices and healthcare organizations. Although PCMH does not require such technologies, they facilitate its success, as care coordination and population management necessitated by the model are difficult to do without. This article argues that there is a paradox in PCMH and technology is at its center. Although PCMH intends to be cost effective by reducing hospital admissions and ER visits through providing better preventative services, it is actually a financial risk due to the very real upfront costs of implementing and sustaining technologies needed to carry out the intent of the PCMH model, which may not be made up immediately, if ever. This article delves into the rationale behind why payers, providers, and patients have adopted PCMH regardless of this risk and in doing so, maps out the roles that innovative technologies play in the conversion to PCMH.},

Telemedicine platforms can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of surgical care. The purpose of this study is to determine whether remote digital video evaluations are reliable in the context of a short-term plastic surgical intervention.
SETTING: The setting for this study was a district hospital located in Latacunga, Ecuador.
PATIENTS: Participants were 27 consecutive patients who presented for operative repair of cleft lip and palate.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We calculated kappa coefficients for reliability between in-person and remote digital video assessments for the classification of cleft lip and palate between two separate craniofacial surgeons. We hypothesized that the technology would be a reliable method of preoperative assessment for cleft disease.
RESULTS: Of the 27 (81.4\%) participants, 22 received operative treatment for their cleft disorder. Mean age was 11.1 ± 8.3 years. Patients presented with a spectrum of disorders, including cleft lip (24 of 27, 88.9\%), cleft palate (19 of 27, 70.4\%), and alveolar cleft (19 of 27, 70.4\%). We found a 95.7\% agreement between observers for cleft lip with substantial reliability (κ = .78, P {\textless} .01). There was an 82.6\% agreement between observers for cleft palate, with a moderate interrater reliability (κ = .55, P = .01). We found only a 47.8\% agreement between observers for alveolar cleft with a nonsignificant, weak kappa agreement (κ = .06, P = .74).
CONCLUSIONS: Remote digital assessments are a reliable way to preoperatively diagnose cleft lip and palate in the context of short-term plastic surgical interventions in low- and middle-income countries. Future work will evaluate the potential for real-time, telemedicine assessments to reduce cost and improve clinical effectiveness in global plastic surgery.},

	abstract = {AIM: To conduct a review of the telepsychiatry literature.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the literature on telepsychiatry using the search terms, "telepsychiatry", "telemental health", "telecare", "telemedicine", "e-health", and "videoconferencing". To meet criteria for inclusion, studies had to: (1) be published in a peer-reviewed journal after the year 2000; (2) be written in English; (3) use videoconferencing technology for the provision of mental health assessment or treatment services; and (4) use an adequately-powered randomized controlled trial design in the case of treatment outcome studies. Out of 1976 studies identified by searches in PubMed (Medline database), Ovid medline, PsychInfo, Embase, and EBSCO PSYCH, 452 met inclusion criteria. Studies that met all inclusion criteria were organized into one of six categories: (1) satisfaction; (2) reliability; (3) treatment outcomes; (4) implementation outcomes; (5) cost effectiveness; and (6) and legal issues. All disagreements were resolved by reassessing study characteristics and discussion.
RESULTS: Overall, patients and providers are generally satisfied with telepsychiatry services. Providers, however, tend to express more concerns about the potentially adverse of effects of telepsychiatry on therapeutic rapport. Patients are less likely to endorse such concerns about impaired rapport with their provider. Although few studies appropriately employ non-inferiority designs, the evidence taken together suggests that telepsychiatry is comparable to face-to-face services in terms of reliability of clinical assessments and treatment outcomes. When non-inferiority designs were appropriately used, telepsychiatry performed as well as, if not better than face-to-face delivery of mental health services. Studies using both rudimentary and more sophisticated methods for evaluating cost-effectiveness indicate that telepsychiatry is not more expensive than face-to-face delivery of mental health services and that telepsychiatry is actually more cost-effective in the majority of studies reviewed. Notwithstanding legal concerns about loss of confidentiality and limited capacity to respond to psychiatric emergencies, we uncovered no published reports of these adverse events in the use of telepsychiatry.
CONCLUSION: A large evidence base supports telepsychiatry as a delivery method for mental health services. Future studies will inform optimal approaches to implementing and sustaining telepsychiatry services.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The smartphone-based whole slide imaging (WSI) system represents a low-cost and effective alternative to automatic scanners for telepathology. In a previous study, the development of one such solution, named scalable whole slide imaging (sWSI), was presented and analyzed. A clinical evaluation of its iOS version with 100 frozen section samples verified the diagnosis-readiness of the produced virtual slides.
OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study was to delve into the quantifying issues encountered in the development of an Android version. It should also provide insights into future high-resolution real-time feedback medical imaging apps on Android and invoke the awareness of smartphone manufacturers for collaboration. The second aim of this study was to further verify the clinical value of sWSI with cytology samples. This type is different from the frozen section samples in that they require finer detail on the cellular level.
METHODS: During sWSI development on Android, it was discovered that many models do not support uncompressed camera pixel data with sufficient resolution and full field of view. The proportion of models supporting the optimal format was estimated in a test on 200 mainstream Android models. Other factors, including slower processing speed and camera preview freezing, also led to inferior performance of sWSI on Android compared with the iOS version. The processing speed was mostly determined by the central processing unit frequency in theory, and the relationship was investigated in the 200-model simulation experiment with physical devices. The camera preview freezing was caused by the lag between triggering photo capture and resuming preview. In the clinical evaluation, 100 ThinPrep cytology test samples covering 6 diseases were scanned with sWSI and compared against the ground truth of optical microscopy.
RESULTS: Among the tested Android models, only 3.0\% (6/200) provided an optimal data format, meeting all criteria of quality and efficiency. The image-processing speed demonstrated a positive relationship with the central processing unit frequency but to a smaller degree than expected and was highly model-dependent. The virtual slides produced by sWSI on Android and iOS of ThinPrep cytology test samples achieved similar high quality. Using optical microscopy as the ground truth, pathologists made a correct diagnosis on 87.5\% (175/200) of the cases with sWSI virtual slides. Depending on the sWSI version and the pathologist in charge, the kappa value varied between .70 and .82. All participating pathologists considered the quality of the sWSI virtual slides in the experiment to be adequate for routine usage.
CONCLUSIONS: Limited by hardware and operating system support, the performance of sWSI on mainstream Android smartphones did not fully match the iOS version. However, in practice, this difference was not significant, and both were adequate for digitizing most of the sample types for telepathology consultation.},

	abstract = {Falls are the primary cause of accidents among the elderly and frequently cause fatal and non-fatal injuries associated with a large amount of medical costs. Fall detection using wearable wireless sensor nodes has the potential of improving elderly telecare. This investigation proposes a ZigBee-based location-aware fall detection system for elderly telecare that provides an unobstructed communication between the elderly and caregivers when falls happen. The system is based on ZigBee-based sensor networks, and the sensor node consists of a motherboard with a tri-axial accelerometer and a ZigBee module. A wireless sensor node worn on the waist continuously detects fall events and starts an indoor positioning engine as soon as a fall happens. In the fall detection scheme, this study proposes a three-phase threshold-based fall detection algorithm to detect critical and normal falls. The fall alarm can be canceled by pressing and holding the emergency fall button only when a normal fall is detected. On the other hand, there are three phases in the indoor positioning engine: path loss survey phase, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) collection phase and location calculation phase. Finally, the location of the faller will be calculated by a k-nearest neighbor algorithm with weighted RSSI. The experimental results demonstrate that the fall detection algorithm achieves 95.63\% sensitivity, 73.5\% specificity, 88.62\% accuracy and 88.6\% precision. Furthermore, the average error distance for indoor positioning is 1.15 ± 0.54 m. The proposed system successfully delivers critical information to remote telecare providers who can then immediately help a fallen person.},

Meanwhile, it meets the requirement of dynamic ECG systems for mobile users in terms of the detection accuracy and latency. We carried out clinical trials by deploying the WE-CARE systems at Peking University Hospital. The clinical results clearly showed that our solution achieves a high detection rate of over 95\% against common types of anomalies in ECG, while it only incurs a small detection latency around one second, both of which meet the criteria of real-time medical diagnosis. As demonstrated by the clinical results, the WE-CARE system is a useful and efficient mHealth (mobile health) tool for the cardiovascular disease diagnosis and treatment in medical platforms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Teledermatology utilizes telecommunication technologies for the exchange of dermatologic information across distances. In 2000, we developed the Virtual Grand Rounds in Dermatology (VGRD) as a free, user-friendly platform for dermatologists to present complex dermatologic cases to the international community for clinical feedback, consultation, and continuing education.
METHODS: VGRD was designed using simple graphics to facilitate access in remote and developing geographic regions. Members present their case according to a recommended template and are encouraged to provide clinical and histopathologic photographs. Viewers' comments are posted on the site within 24-48 h following receipt.
RESULTS: VGRD's low-cost store-and-forward system allows easy accessibility to expertise for colleagues around the world. VGRD currently comprises a community of 344 clinicians across all dermatologic subspecialties, and links users to cases as well as a recent interactive addition for more urgent feedback: VGRD Blog. The Maine Virtual Skin Clinic is another sister site developed as an educational tool for physicians and residents in primary care. VGRD can be found at http://www.vgrd.org.
CONCLUSIONS: With its easy-to-use platform for teleconsultation services, VGRD has the potential to enhance clinical outcomes and education. In the next few years, we hope to continue to expand VGRD, including launching a comprehensive search engine in VGRD to provide users with a "one-stop resource." With the growth of teledermatology, we will combine web consultations with web-based education into a single resource for dermatologists interested in new possibilities in clinical practice, patient care, and continuing education.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide an overview of Chinese mHealth apps as of December 2015.
METHODS: We identified and investigated the most downloaded apps from the iOS and Android platforms. For each app, we analyzed and recorded its main service offered, mHealth initiative, disease and specialty focus, app cost, target user, Web app availability, and emphasis on information security. Standard descriptive statistics were used.
RESULTS: A total of 234 apps met the inclusion criteria and were investigated. The apps targeting nonhealth care professionals focused on providing telemedicine and appointment-making services. The apps targeting health care professionals focused on education and peer reviewed articles. The most common disease-specific apps focused primarily on diabetes, hypertension, and hepatitis management. Most apps were free and available on both iOS and Android platforms.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary mHealth initiatives targeted by the apps reflect Chinese patients' demand for access to medical care. Disease-specific apps are also representative of disease prevalence in China. Government press releases suggest that new policies on the horizon may shift the industry.},

Taiwan's government executed the Taiwan's Telehealth Pilot Project (TTPP) from July 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008, using healthcare information technology to tackle these problems. The system has three different models, the home-care, the community-care, and the residential-care model to assist the elderly in the pursuit of better healthcare and improved quality of life. The results revealed both the home-care and community-care models facilitated timely medical responses if the enrolled patients had emergent conditions. In the home-care model, the hospital readmission rate was reduced from 8.19\% to 3.17\%, and the hospital visit rate was decreased from 2.95\% to 2.90\%. In community-care model, the medication nonadherence rate was reduced from 38.20\% to 9.20\%. In the residential-care model, reduced rates of readmission to the hospital, nosocomial infection and the adverse drug event were found. Telehealth enabled the aged with chronic illnesses to live independently and helped the institutionalized elderly get acute care more efficiently without increased manpower of healthcare organization.},

	abstract = {The potential  of telemedicine in respiratory health care has not been completely unveiled in part due to the inexistence of reliable objective measurements of symptoms such as cough. Currently available cough detectors are uncomfortable and expensive at a time when generic smartphones can perform this task. However, two major challenges preclude smartphone-based cough detectors from effective deployment namely, the need to deal with noisy environments and computational cost. This paper focuses on the latter, since complex machine learning algorithms are too slow for real-time use and kill the battery in a few hours unless specific actions are taken. In this paper, we present a robust and efficient implementation of a smartphone-based cough detector. The audio signal acquired from the device's microphone is processed by computing local Hu moments as a robust feature set in the presence of background noise. We previously demonstrated that pairing Hu moments and a standard k-NN classifier achieved accurate cough detection at the expense of computation time. To speed-up k-NN search, many tree structures have been proposed. Our cough detector uses an improved vantage point (vp)-tree with optimized construction methods and a distance function that results in faster searches. We achieve 18× speed-up over classic vp-trees, and 560× over standard implementations of k-NN in state-of-the-art machine learning libraries, with classification accuracies over 93\%, enabling real-time performance on low-end smartphones.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify differences in outcomes, patient satisfaction, and related health care costs in spinal, hip, and shoulder pain patients who initiated care with medical doctors (MDs) vs those who initiated care with doctors of chiropractic (DCs) in Switzerland.
METHODS: A retrospective double cohort design was used. A self-administered questionnaire was completed by first-contact care spinal, hip, and shoulder pain patients who, 4 months previously, contacted a Swiss telemedicine provider regarding advice about their complaint. Related health care costs were determined in a subsample of patients by reviewing the claims database of a Swiss insurance provider.
RESULTS: The study sample included 403 patients who had seen MDs and 316 patients who had seen DCs as initial health care providers for their complaint. Differences in patient sociodemographic characteristics were found in terms of age, pain location, and mode of onset. Patients initially consulting MDs had significantly less reduction in their numerical pain rating score (difference of 0.32) and were significantly less likely to be satisfied with the care received (odds ratio = 1.79) and the outcome of care (odds ratio = 1.52). No significant differences were found for Patient's Global Impression of Change ratings. Mean costs per patient over 4 months were significantly lower in patients initially consulting DCs (difference of CHF 368; US \$368).
CONCLUSION: Spinal, hip, and shoulder pain patients had clinically similar pain relief, greater satisfaction levels, and lower overall cost if they initiated care with DCs, when compared with those who initiated care with MDs.},

DESIGN: Single-blinded randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: General community.
PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of adults with SCI (N=84; mean time post-SCI, 9.9y; mean age, 46y; 73.8\% men; 44\% with paraplegia; 58\% white).
INTERVENTIONS: Trained peer health coaches applied the person-centered health self-management intervention with 42 experimental subjects over 6 months on a tapered call schedule. The 42 control subjects received usual care. Both groups received the MCMC Resource Guide.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome-health self-management as measured by the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). Secondary outcomes-global ratings of service/resource use, health-related quality of life, and quality of primary care.
RESULTS: Intervention participants averaged 12 calls over 6 months (averaging 21.8min each), with distinct variation. At 6 months, intervention participants reported a significantly greater change in PAM scores (6mo: estimate, 7.029; 95\% confidence interval, .1018-13.956; P=.0468) compared with controls, with a trend toward significance at 4 months. At 6 months, intervention participants reported a significantly greater decrease in social/role activity limitations (estimate, -.443; P=.0389), greater life satisfaction (estimate, 1.0091; P=.0522), greater services/resources awareness (estimate, 1.678; P=.0253), greater overall service use (estimate, 1.069; P=.0240), and a greater number of services used (estimate, 1.542; P=.0077). Subgroups most impacted by MCMC on PAM change scores included the following: high social support, white persons, men, 1 to 6 years postinjury, and tetraplegic.
CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrates that the MCMC peer-led, health self-management intervention achieved a positive impact on self-management to prevent secondary conditions in adults with SCI. These results warrant a larger, multisite trial of its efficacy and cost-effectiveness.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Bladder cancer is the most costly malignancy to manage per capita due to the technical nature and intensity of follow-up. There are few urologists in rural areas, often necessitating that patients travel hours to receive follow-up care multiple times per year. We plan to train registered nurses and allied health professionals to perform cystoscopies which are monitored and interpreted in real-time by board-certified urologists. The key is to ensure optimal picture resolution to guarantee this technology is not inferior to traditional cystoscopy. Our objective was to develop the technical infrastructure needed for a tele-cystoscopy system through assessment of the transmitted video quality using expert reviewers and crowd-sourcing.
METHODS: All combinations of the tele-cystoscopy system were systematically tested using a single Thiel cadaver. The videos were reviewed by expert urologists and general reviewers using a crowd-sourcing website. The video quality responses were assessed to determine concordance between each set of reviewers, and to determine the optimal equipment that should be selected for the tele-cystoscopy system.
RESULTS: Of eight equipment combinations, only two were of high enough quality to be appropriate for medical use. We found there to be strong concordance of responses between the expert and crowd-sourced responses. The trade-offs between cost and tele-cystoscopy system component quality were compared with efficiency frontiers to elucidate the optimal system.
DISCUSSION: We created and tested the feasibility of a tele-cystoscopy system that was deemed suitable for medical diagnosis by a group of experts. We further validated tele-cystoscopy video quality using both experts and recently validated crowd-sourcing.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to model the cost of delivering behavioural health services to rural Native American populations using telecommunications and compare these costs with the travel costs associated with providing equivalent care.
METHODS: Behavioural telehealth costs were modelled using equipment, transmission, administrative and IT costs from an established telecommunications centre. Two types of travel models were estimated: a patient travel model and a physician travel model. These costs were modelled using the New Mexico resource geographic information system program (RGIS) and ArcGIS software and unit costs (e.g. fuel prices, vehicle depreciation, lodging, physician wages, and patient wages) that were obtained from the literature and US government agencies.
RESULTS: The average per-patient cost of providing behavioural healthcare via telehealth was US\$138.34, and the average per-patient travel cost was US\$169.76 for physicians and US\$333.52 for patients. Sensitivity analysis found these results to be rather robust to changes in imputed parameters and preliminary evidence of economies of scale was found.
CONCLUSION: Besides the obvious benefits of increased access to healthcare and reduced health disparities, providing behavioural telehealth for rural Native American populations was estimated to be less costly than modelled equivalent care provided by travelling. Additionally, as administrative and coordination costs are a major component of telehealth costs, as programmes grow to serve more patients, the relative costs of these initial infrastructure as well as overall per-patient costs should decrease.},

OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to examine cost, caring, and family-centered care in relationship to pediatric specialty services integrating telemedicine visits compared to traditional face-to-face visits only for (CSHCN) in rural, remote, and medically underserved areas.
METHODS: This study used a prospective, quasiexperimental research design with 222 parents or legal guardians of CSHCN receiving pediatric specialty care. The traditional group (n = 110) included families receiving face-to-face pediatric specialty care and the telemedicine group (n = 112) included families who had telemedicine visits along with traditional face-to-face pediatric specialty care.
RESULTS: Results indicated no significant differences in family costs when the telemedicine group was compared to traditional face-to-face care. When the telemedicine group was asked to anticipate costs if telemedicine was not available, there were significant differences found across all variables, including travel miles, cost of travel, missed work hours, wages lost, child care cost, lodging cost, other costs, and total family cost (p {\textless} 0.001). There were no differences in the families' perceptions of care as caring. Parents/guardians perceived the system of care as significantly more family-centered when using telemedicine (p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study underscore the importance of facilitating access to pediatric specialty care by use of telemedicine. We endorse efforts to increase healthcare access and decrease cost for CSHCN by expanding telemedicine and shaping health policy accordingly.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We performed a comparative study of a health education programme that was delivered either through one-way communication with printed media, or through interactive videophone interviews. We aimed to ascertain which mode of counselling, when used in combination with telemonitoring, is more effective at lifestyle modification intended to improve health status.
METHODS: Participants, who were residents of Kurihara city in Miyagi prefecture, Japan, were randomized into two groups: one group received individualized monthly documented reports (n = 33; 22 females; average age: 67.2 years), and the other received interactive videophone communication (n = 35; 22 females; average age: 65.1 years) for three months. Telemonitoring was conducted on both groups, using a pedometer, weighing scale and a sphygmomanometer. Pre- and post-intervention, anthropometric measurements and blood tests were performed; the participants also completed self-administered questionnaires.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The two groups showed similar degrees of health status improvement and satisfaction levels. However, the participants in the videophone group were more aware of improvements in their lifestyles than were the participants in the document group. The individualized printed communication programme was less time-consuming compared to videophone communication. Further studies are needed to formulate a balanced protocol for a counselling-cum-telemonitoring programme that provides optimal health improvement and cost performance with the available human resources.},

METHODS: Food insecurity data were obtained by telephone survey (n=74). Group differences for continuous variables were measured by t tests; categorical variables by Pearson chi-square tests.
RESULTS: Participants reporting mild food insecurity (23\%) had higher body mass index (35.5±7.1 kg/m2 vs 30.5±6.0 kg/m2, P=.01) and lower household incomes (P=.03) and were more likely to consider cost of ingredients in food preparation compared to food-secure participants (P=.03). Most purchased fresh produce (97\%) and considered the dietitian's advice when purchasing food. Both groups report similar adherence to dietitians' advice and had similar glycemic control.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Strategies to address higher levels of obesity associated with food insecurity are needed.},

In-person DOT is resource intensive and often burdensome for patients. Video DOT (vDOT) has been proposed as an alternative to increase treatment flexibility and better meet patient-specific needs.
Methods: We conducted a pragmatic, prospective pilot implementation of vDOT at 3 TB clinics in Maryland. A mixed-methods approach was implemented to assess (1) effectiveness, (2) acceptability, and (3) cost. Medication adherence on vDOT was compared with that of in-person DOT. Interviews and surveys were conducted with patients and providers before and after implementation, with framework analysis utilized to extract salient themes. Last, a cost analysis assessed the economic impacts of vDOT implementation across heterogeneous clinic structures.
Results: Medication adherence on vDOT was comparable to that of in-person DOT (94\% vs 98\%, P = .17), with a higher percentage of total treatment doses (inclusive of weekend/holiday self-administration) ultimately observed during the vDOT period (72\% vs 66\%, P = .03). Video DOT was well received by staff and patients alike, who cited increased treatment flexibility, convenience, and patient privacy. Our cost analysis estimated a savings with vDOT of \$1391 per patient for a standard 6-month treatment course.
Conclusions: Video DOT is an acceptable and important option for measurement of TB treatment adherence and may allow a higher proportion of prescribed treatment doses to be observed, compared with in-person DOT. Video DOT may be cost-saving and should be considered as a component of individualized, patient-centered case management plans.},

INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated objective outcomes of the implementation of a novel Resident Handbook Application (RHAP) for smart phones.
METHODS: The RHAP included tools necessary to make proper assessments and to order appropriate tests. The RHAPs effectiveness was accessed using the Military Health System Military Mart database. This database includes patient specific aggregate data, including diagnosis, patient demographics, itemized cost, hospital days, and disposition status. Multivariable analysis was used to compare before and after RHAP implementation, controlling for patient demographics and diagnosis. Internal medicine admission data were used as a control group.
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease in laboratory costs and a strong trend toward statistically significant decreases in the cost of radiology performed after implementation of RHAP (p value of {\textless}0.02 and {\textless}0.07, respectively). There was also a decrease in hospital days (3.66-3.30 days), in total cost per admission (\$18,866-\$16,305), and in cost per hospital day per patient (\$5,140-\$4,936). During the same time period a Control group had no change or increases in these areas.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of the RHAP resulted in decreases in costs in a variety of areas and a decrease in hospital bed days without any apparent negative effect upon patient outcomes or disposition status.},

We have reviewed the literature on home monitoring techniques, and developed two prototype platforms for remote collection of physiological data. We have refined one of the prototypes and subjected it to user testing among health professionals and their clients. Fifty patients will be involved in a randomized controlled trial aiming to establish if the home telemonitoring of CHF is clinically feasible and cost-effective. The ePoint.telemed platform is a fully automated internet based system meant for early warnings in a CHF rehabilitation program. The core of the platform is a dashboard connected to a blood pressure meter, a weight scale, and a web-based patient questionnaire. Unlike traditional systems built on dedicated medical equipment, we are applying easy-to-use components geared towards the sports market.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Providing acutely ill children in isolated communities access to specialized care is challenging. This study aimed to evaluate remote presence robotic technology (RPRT) for enhancing pediatric remote assessments, expediting initiation of treatment, refining triaging, and reducing the need for transport.
METHODS: We conducted a pilot prospective observational study at a primary/urgent care clinic in an isolated northern community. Participants (n = 38) were acutely ill children {\textless}17 years presenting to the clinic, whom local healthcare professionals had considered for interfacility transportation (IFT). Participants were assessed and managed by a tertiary center pediatric intensivist through a remote presence robot. The intensivist triaged participants to either remain at the clinic or be transported to regional/tertiary care. Controls from a pre-existing local transport database were matched using propensity scoring. The primary outcome was the number of IFTs among participants versus controls.
RESULTS: Fourteen of 38 (37\%) participants required transport, whereas all controls were transported (p {\textless} 0.0001). Six of 14 (43\%) transported participants were triaged to a nearby regional hospital, while no controls were regionalized (p = 0.0001). All participants who remained at the clinic stayed {\textless}24 h, and were matched to controls who stayed 4.9 days in tertiary care (p {\textless} 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in hospital length of stay between transported participants and controls (6.0 vs. 5.7 days).
CONCLUSIONS: RPRT reduced the need for specialized pediatric IFT, while enabling regionalization when appropriate. This study may have implications for the broader implementation of RPRT, while reducing costs to the healthcare system.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness of PhysioDirect with usual physiotherapy care for patients with musculoskeletal problems.
DESIGN: (1) Cost-consequences comparing cost to the National Health Service (NHS), to patients, and the value of lost productivity with a range of outcomes. (2) Cost-utility analysis comparing cost to the NHS with Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).
SETTING: Four physiotherapy services in England.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults (18+) referred by their general practitioner or self-referred for physiotherapy.
INTERVENTIONS: PhysioDirect involved telephone assessment and advice followed by face-to-face care if needed. Usual care patients were placed on a waiting list for face-to-face care.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Primary clinical outcome: physical component summary from the SF-36v2 at 6 months. Also included in the cost-consequences: Measure Yourself Medical Outcomes Profile; a Global Improvement Score; response to treatment; patient satisfaction; waiting time. Outcome for the cost-utility analysis: QALYs.
RESULTS: 2249 patients took part (1506 PhysioDirect; 743 usual care). (1) Cost-consequences: there was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in the cost of physiotherapy, other NHS services, personal costs or value of time off work. Outcomes were also similar. (2) Cost-utility analysis based on complete cases (n=1272). Total NHS costs, including the cost of physiotherapy were higher in the PhysioDirect group by £19.30 (95\% CI -£37.60 to £76.19) and there was a QALY gain of 0.007 (95\% CI -0.003 to 0.016). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £2889 and the net monetary benefit at λ=£20 000 was £117 (95\% CI -£86 to £310).
CONCLUSIONS: PhysioDirect may be a cost-effective alternative to usual physiotherapy care, though only with careful management of staff time. Physiotherapists providing the service must be more fully occupied than was possible under trial conditions: consideration should be given to the scale of operation, opening times of the service and flexibility in the methods used to contact patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In today's health care environment, increasing costs and inadequate medical resources have created a worldwide need for more affordable diagnostic tools that are also portable, fast, and easy to use. To address this issue, numerous research and commercial efforts have focused on developing rapid diagnostic technologies; however, the efficacy of existing systems has been hindered by usability problems or high production costs, making them infeasible for deployment in at-home, point-of-care (POC), or resource-limited settings.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to create a low-cost optical reader system that integrates with any smart device and accepts any type of rapid diagnostic test strip to provide fast and accurate data collection, sample analysis, and diagnostic result reporting.
METHODS: An iterative design methodology was employed by a multidisciplinary research team to engineer three versions of a portable diagnostic testing device that were evaluated for usability and overall user receptivity.
RESULTS: Repeated design critiques and usability studies identified a number of system requirements and considerations (eg, software compatibility, biomatter contamination, and physical footprint) that we worked to incrementally incorporate into successive system variants. Our final design phase culminated in the development of Tidbit, a reader that is compatible with any Wi-Fi-enabled device and test strip format. The Tidbit includes various features that support intuitive operation, including a straightforward test strip insertion point, external indicator lights, concealed electronic components, and an asymmetric shape, which inherently signals correct device orientation. Usability testing of the Tidbit indicates high usability for potential user communities.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the design process, specification, and user reception of the Tidbit, an inexpensive, easy-to-use, portable optical reader for fast, accurate quantification of rapid diagnostic test results. Usability testing suggests that the reader is usable among and can benefit a wide group of potential users, including in POC contexts. Generally, the methodology of this study demonstrates the importance of testing these types of systems with potential users and exemplifies how iterative design processes can be employed by multidisciplinary research teams to produce compelling technological solutions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence that home telemonitoring for patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) offers clinical benefit over usual care is controversial as is evidence of a health economic advantage.
METHODS: Between January 2010 and June 2013, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CHF were enrolled and randomly assigned to 2 study groups comprising usual care with and without an interactive bi-directional remote monitoring system (Motiva®). The primary endpoint in CardioBBEAT is the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) established by the groups' difference in total cost and in the combined clinical endpoint "days alive and not in hospital nor inpatient care per potential days in study" within the follow-up of 12 months.
RESULTS: A total of 621 predominantly male patients were enrolled, whereof 302 patients were assigned to the intervention group and 319 to the control group. Ischemic cardiomyopathy was the leading cause of heart failure. Despite randomization, subjects of the control group were more often in NYHA functional class III-IV, and exhibited peripheral edema and renal dysfunction more often. Additionally, the control and intervention groups differed in heart rhythm disorders. No differences existed regarding risk factor profile, comorbidities, echocardiographic parameters, especially left ventricular and diastolic diameter and ejection fraction, as well as functional test results, medication and quality of life. While the observed baseline differences may well be a play of chance, they are of clinical relevance. Therefore, the statistical analysis plan was extended to include adjusted analyses with respect to the baseline imbalances.
CONCLUSIONS: CardioBBEAT provides prospective outcome data on both, clinical and health economic impact of home telemonitoring in CHF. The study differs by the use of a high evidence level randomized controlled trial (RCT) design along with actual cost data obtained from health insurance companies. Its results are conducive to informed political and economic decision-making with regard to home telemonitoring solutions as an option for health care. Overall, it contributes to developing advanced health economic evaluation instruments to be deployed within the specific context of the German Health Care System.

The projected costs are based not only upon the loss contribution of these warriors to our economy, but also the long-term medical and assistive care that will be needed to support these veterans for decades to come. Thus, the primary goal of the Assisted Living Pilot Project (ALPP) at the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center - Johnstown (DVBIC-J) is to promote the ability of the injured warrior to move from assisted living to living independently and to be self-supporting by providing a continuum of care. To accomplish this goal the DVBIC-J ALPP is providing full set of traditional services (physical, occupational, speech, psychological/cognitive, social/familial, vocational, and spiritual), along with "cutting-edge" rehabilitative treatment technologies. These cutting-edge therapies include transdisciplinary clinical consultations, interactive patient and family counseling, and telemedicine-teleconferencing for clinical evaluations and family/significant other care participation. These services will be available to those who require assisted living through their progression to community re-entry. The ALPP also serves as a vehicle for clinical trials to investigate the effects of an enriched environment (e.g., recreational therapies, massage, multisensory stimulation, etc.) on neurorehabilitation therapy, rural telemedicine for servicemembers with traumatic brain injury, and long-term outcome measures of those who have received neurorehabilitation services at the DVBIC-J site. DVBIC-J is also developing collaborative projects with universities and private industry to create an incubator for new rehabilitation technologies. The technologies that DVBIC-J will be focusing on will include assistive technologies (to assist cognitive, physical, and communicative impairments), virtual and augmented reality simulations (for both diagnosis and treatment of TBI and PTSD), and telecommunication technologies to improve rehabilitation services to those warriors that have returned to their homes in rural areas.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate whether telemonitoring interventions for COPD are cost-effective from the perspective of German statutory sickness funds.
METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a combination of a Markov model and a decision tree. Telemonitoring as add-on to standard treatment was compared with standard treatment alone. The model consisted of four transition stages to account for COPD severity, and a terminal stage for death. Within each cycle, the frequency of exacerbations as well as outcomes for 2015 costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for each stage were calculated. Values for input parameters were taken from the literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.
RESULTS: In the base case, telemonitoring led to an increase in incremental costs (€866 per patient) but also in incremental QALYs (0.05 per patient). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was thus €17,410 per QALY gained. A deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that hospitalisation rate and costs for telemonitoring equipment greatly affected results. The probabilistic ICER averaged €34,432 per QALY (95 \% confidence interval 12,161-56,703).
CONCLUSION: We provide evidence that telemonitoring may be cost-effective in Germany from a payer's point of view. This holds even after deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.},

Comparisons were made between the intellectual ability index scores obtained by a psychologist sitting face-to-face with the children and another psychologist via telehealth using a web-based platform, Coviu. Results The telehealth administration method yielded comparable results to the face-to-face method. Correlation analyses showed high associations between the testing methodologies on the intellectual ability indices (correlation coefficient range = 0.981-0.997). Discussion Findings indicate that telehealth may be an alternative to face-to-face cognitive assessment. Future work in a broader range of cognitive tests and wider range of clinical populations is warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telehealth programs are a growing field in the care of patients. The evolution of information technology has resulted in telehealth becoming a fourth-generation synchronous program. However, long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness analysis of fourth-generation telehealth programs have not been reported in patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted this study to assess the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a fourth-generation synchronous telehealth program for patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 575 patients who had joined a telehealth program and compared them with 1178 patients matched for sex, age, and Charlson comorbidity index. The program included: (1) instant transmission of biometric data, (2) daily telephone interview, and (3) continuous decision-making support. Data on hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, and medical costs were collected from the hospital's database and were adjusted to the follow-up months.
RESULTS: The mean age was 64.5 years (SD 16.0). The mean number of monthly ED visits (mean 0.06 SD 0.13 vs mean 0.09 SD 0.23, P{\textless}.001), hospitalizations (mean 0.05 SD 0.12 vs mean 0.11 SD 0.21, P{\textless}.001), length of hospitalization (mean 0.77 days SD 2.78 vs mean 1.4 SD 3.6, P{\textless}.001), and intensive care unit admissions (mean 0.01 SD 0.07 vs mean 0.036 SD 0.14, P{\textless}.001) were lower in the telehealth group. The monthly mean costs of ED visits (mean US\$20.90 SD 66.60 vs mean US\$37.30 SD 126.20, P{\textless}.001), hospitalizations (mean US\$386.30 SD 1424.30 vs mean US\$878.20 SD 2697.20, P{\textless}.001), and all medical costs (mean US\$587.60 SD 1497.80 vs mean US\$1163.60 SD 3036.60, P{\textless}.001) were lower in the telehealth group. The intervention costs per patient were US\$224.80 per month. Multivariate analyses revealed that age, telehealth care, and Charlson index were the independent factors for ED visits, hospitalizations, and length of hospitalization. A bootstrap method revealed the dominant cost-effectiveness of telehealth care over usual care.
CONCLUSIONS: Better cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes were noted with the use of a fourth-generation synchronous telehealth program in patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. The intervention costs of this new generation of telehealth program do not increase the total costs for patient care.},

	doi = {10.1089/tmj.2012.0148},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Arkansas Medicaid program for low-income women provides cervical cancer screening, in the form of Pap smears, and treatment but no diagnostic means of bridging the two, such as a procedure called "colposcopy." Telemedicine offers a viable means to bridging this gap. Previously telecolposcopy has been used in small demonstration projects as a means to deliver colposcopy services to at-risk rural populations at a comparable quality to in-person colposcopy.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences' Antenatal \& Neonatal Guidelines, Education and Learning System Program and Center for Distance Health developed an innovative collaborative telemedicine pilot program with the Arkansas Department of Health that used both specialty physician oversight and nurse examiners. Underserved rural patients from the Department of Health were provided with colposcopy services via interactive telemedicine at four separate spoke sites. During each weekly 3-h clinic, an advanced practice nurse/nurse practitioner at each of the spoke sites performed the exams and collected biopsy specimens under the real-time, interactive supervision of an experienced faculty member at the hub site.
RESULTS: Between January 1, 2010 and June 21, 2011, the program scheduled 1,812 visits, involving 1,504 unduplicated patient referrals from 68 of Arkansas's 75 counties, and performed 1,298 telecolposcopic exams.
CONCLUSIONS: This project provides complex specialty gynecological services using telemedicine technology to overcome geographic barriers to care while producing results comparable to traditional examinations. It is cost-effective and well received by patients and can be used as a model for improving access to care among vulnerable populations.},

INTRODUCTION: While Pap smear screening has increased across the United States, the rural South still reports high rates of cervical cancer and mortality. One solution to improve patient outcomes related to cervical cancer in rural settings is telecolposcopy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women with abnormal Pap results or an abnormal visual examination needing an evaluation by colposcopy were referred to a hospital-based telecolposcopy program. Descriptive data are provided that include patients' access to care based on travel time and transportation costs.
RESULTS: Over a 15-month time period, 940 unique patients were seen using telecolposcopy. Telecolposcopy was done at eight spoke sites across Arkansas representing patients from 72 of the 75 counties. Data for risk factors that include smoking, first sexual experience, and number of sexual partners in past 12 months and in a lifetime are discussed. Pap results and impression are provided. In addition, avoided transportation costs and travel time have been calculated and included.
DISCUSSION: Cervical cancer is important public health concern especially for women residing in rural areas. We were able to demonstrate that our telecolposcopy program has provided sustainability statewide since its inception and that patients are willing to participate. In addition to providing increased access to care, the program also reduced travel time and costs associated with a face-to-face visit.
CONCLUSION: Telecolposcopy should be further explored and utilized in rural settings as a way to reduce patient costs and improve cervical cancer outcomes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Options for leveraging available telemedicine technologies, ranging from simple webcams and telephones to smartphone apps and medical-grade wearable sensors, are evolving faster than the culture of clinical research. Until recently, most clinical trials relied on paper-based processes and technology. This cost- and labor-intensive system, while slowly changing, remains an obstacle to new drug development. Alternatives that use existing tools and processes for collecting real-world data in home settings warrant closer examination.
METHODS: The site-less clinical research organization (CRO) model, whereby pharmacists or other health care professionals provide useful and timely counseling for protocol compliance by regular phone and videoconferencing sessions, is a flexible approach to managing clinical trial participants directly from their homes. An expert panel, including clinical specialists in metabolic or neurodegenerative diseases, health information technology and CRO innovators, and the pharmaceutical industry, met in Dallas, Texas, December 2016, to discuss advancing avenues for site-less CRO and other remote clinical trial practices, taking into account investigator, sponsor, and regulatory perspectives.
FINDINGS: Real-time "site-less" management of clinical trials can augment traditional research and development methods by providing data from a broader, more diverse group of patients in real-world practice settings. This methodology also helps to proactively identify safety profile and operational issues. Current use of site-less CRO practices constitutes an important bridge to alternative trial models, including "large simple trials" that strive to answer one or two questions using data derived from representative patient populations treated in typical clinical settings.
IMPLICATIONS: Site-less CROs offer a working example of how remote technologies and in-home monitoring methods can address shortcomings of conventional drug development. This model maximizes time and cost, as well as potentially earlier identification of adverse events. Coordinated communication among investigators, sponsors, regulators, and patients will be needed to develop standardized strategies for incorporating site-less CROs into current and future study design.},

This paper briefly organizes these technologies into low, mid and high intensity telehealth models and reviews the evidence base for interventions to primary care, and, specifically, for TP and integrated care (IC). Technology, mobile health, and IC competencies facilitate quality care. TP is a high intensity model and it is the best-studied option. Studies of IC are preliminary, but those with collaborative and consultative care show effectiveness. Low- and mid-intensity technology options like telephone, e-mail, text, and e-consults, may provide better access for patients and more timely provider communication and education. They are also probably more cost-effective and versatile for health system workflow. Research is needed upon all technology models related to IC for adult and paediatric primary care populations. Effective healthcare delivery matches the patients' needs with the model, emphasizes clinician competencies, standardizes interventions, and evaluates outcomes.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assist care in a rural state with few child and adolescent psychiatrists, an academic center coordinated a consult system of (1) televideo consults for high-needs children with Medicaid and state Multidisciplinary Team (MDT)/foster care involvement, (2) remote medication reviews for beyond guidelines prescribing, and (3) elective community provider telephone-based consults. Consult service data were collected and analyzed with Wyoming's Medicaid and Foster Care Divisions between the program start in January 2011 until March 2013.
RESULTS: There were 229 televideo MDT/foster care consults, 125 mandatory medication reviews, and 277 elective phone consultations supporting community providers during this period. Following implementation, the number of Medicaid children ≤5 years of age using psychotropic medications decreased by 42\% (p{\textless}0.001), and the number of children using psychotropic doses {\textgreater}150\% of the Food and Drug Administration maximum decreased by 52\% (p{\textless}0.001). Televideo consults redirected 60\% of children slated by caseworkers for a psychiatric residential treatment facility admission into alternative community treatment and placements. A financial return on investment was 1.82 to 1 for combined services.
CONCLUSIONS: This coordinated child telepsychiatry consult system for a state Medicaid division reduced outlier pediatric psychiatric medication prescribing, supported local community-delivered treatments, and reduced unnecessary hospitalizations in a financially advantageous manner that was well received by the practice community.},

An online patient survey and focus groups with patients and staff from the Cancer Genetics Service for Wales (CGSW) were used to explore the acceptability and feasibility of utilizing ICTs within genetics services, which we have termed e-genetics. A total of 225 patients completed the online survey. Many aspects of e-genetics proposed in the survey were highly acceptable to patients, including an electronic version of the family history questionnaire, an email facility for cancer genetic queries, and a computerized decision-aid.

Quantitative and qualitative data suggest that when remote monitoring telehealth technology was utilized in the home-care setting, both clients and providers were very satisfied with services; they felt it was easy to communicate, and that the technology was convenient and user friendly. Clients also felt that home telehealth technology had a very positive impact on the provider-client relationship and improved care.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to review our experience incorporating Interactive Home Telehealth (IHT) visits into follow-up burn care.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all burn patients participating in IHT encounters over the course of 15 months was performed. Connections were established through secure video conferencing and call-routing software. Patients connected with a personal computer or tablet and providers connected with a desktop computer with a high-definition web camera. In some cases, high-definition digital images were emailed to the provider prior to the virtual consultation. For each patient, the following was collected: (1) patient and injury demographics (diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical management), (2) total number of encounters, (3) service for each encounter (burn, psychiatry, and rehabilitation), (4) length of visit, including travel distance and time saved and, (5) complications, including re-admissions and connectivity issues.
RESULTS: 52 virtual encounters were performed with 31 patients during the first year of the pilot project from March 2015 to June 2016. Mean age of the participant was 44 years (range 18-83 years). Mean total burn surface area of the participant was 12\% (range 1-80\%). Average roundtrip travel distance saved was 188 miles (range 4-822 miles). Average round trip travel time saved was 201min (range 20-564min). There were no unplanned re-admissions and no complications. Five connectivity issues were reported, none of which prevented completion of the visit.
CONCLUSIONS: Interactive Home Telehealth is a safe and feasible modality for delivering follow-up care to burn patients. Burn care providers benefit from the potential to improve outpatient clinic utilization. Patients benefit from improved access to multiple members of their specialized burn care team, as well as cost-reductions for patient travel expenses. Future studies are needed to ensure patient and provider satisfaction and to further validate the significance, cost-effectiveness and safety.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemedical programs for patients with chronic heart failure have shown inconsistent effects on survival and hospitalization. Few studies analyzed effects of telemedical interventions on health costs, although this outcome may determine whether or not a successful program will be adopted by health insurance providers. We evaluated a large sized telemedicine program provided by a German statutory health insurance, consisting of regular telephone contacts and, for a subgroup of the participants, provision of an electronic scale in a routine care setting. We examined the effects of the program on the total healthcare costs after one year compared to a matched control group.
METHODS: The evaluation was based on reimbursement data of the statutory health insurance. Participants of the program were matched to appropriate controls using a combination of exact (e.g. 5-year age group, gender, NYHA class) and propensity score (e.g. medication, psychiatric comorbidity) matching. The total health costs after one year were calculated on the basis of regression analyses in an intention-to-treat-approach. In a sensitivity analysis, the subgroup of patients with a documented beginning of the intervention was examined.
RESULTS: Two thousand six hundred twenty two patients with chronic heart failure (55\% male, mean age: 73.7 years) were included in the intervention program. 1943 participants (74\%) could be matched with appropriate control patients. The telemedicine monitoring program for patients with chronic heart failure reduced total health costs after 12 months of the intervention: - 276€ per quarter year in rural regions and - 18€ in urban regions compared to the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: The telemedicine program could reduce total health costs, especially in rural regions in Germany.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify barriers to deployment of four articulated Integrated Care Services supported by Information Technologies in three European sites. The four services covered the entire spectrum of severity of illness. The project targeted chronic patients with obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac failure and/or type II diabetes mellitus.
SETTING: One health care sector in Spain (Barcelona) (n = 11.382); six municipalities in Norway (Trondheim) (n = 450); and one hospital in Greece (Athens) (n = 388).
METHOD: The four services were: (i) Home-based long-term maintenance of rehabilitation effects (n = 337); (ii) Enhanced Care for frail patients, n = 1340); (iii) Home Hospitalization and Early Discharge (n = 2404); and Support for remote diagnosis (forced spirometry testing) in primary care (Support) (n = 8139). Both randomized controlled trials and pragmatic study designs were combined. Two technological approaches were compared. The Model for Assessment of Telemedicine applications was adopted.
RESULTS: The project demonstrated: (i) Sustainability of training effects over time in chronic patients with obstructive pulmonary disease (p {\textless} 0.01); (ii) Enhanced care and fewer hospitalizations in chronic respiratory patients (p {\textless} 0.05); (iii) Reduced in-hospital days for all types of patients (p {\textless} 0.001) in Home Hospitalization/Early Discharge; and (iv) Increased quality of testing (p {\textless} 0.01) for patients with respiratory symptoms in Support, with marked differences among sites.
CONCLUSIONS: The four integrated care services showed high potential to enhance health outcomes with cost-containment. Change management, technological approach and legal issues were major factors modulating the success of the deployment. The project generated a business plan to foster service sustainability and health innovation. Deployment strategies require site-specific adaptations.},

Objective: To evaluate implementation and 10 years follow-up of Home Hospitalization and Early Discharge as an Integrated Care Service in an urban healthcare district in Barcelona.
Methods: Prospective study with pragmatic assessment. Patients: Surgical and medical acute and exacerbated chronic patients requiring admission into a highly specialized hospital, from 2006 to 2015. Intervention: Home-based individualized care plan, administered as a hospital-based outreach service, aiming at substituting hospitalization and implementing a transitional care strategy for optimal discharge. Main measurements: Emergency Department, readmissions and mortality. Patients' and professionals' perspectives, technologies and costs were evaluated.
Results: 4,165 admissions (71 ± 15 yrs; Charlson Index 4 ± 3). In-hospital stay was 1 (0-3) days and the length of home-based stay was 6 (5-7) days. The 30-day readmission rate was 11\% and mortality was 2\%. Patients, careers and health professionals expressed high levels of satisfaction (98\%). At the start, the service was reimbursed at a flat rate of 918€ per patient discharged, significantly lower than conventional hospitalization (2,879€) but still allowing the hospital to keep a balanced budget. At present, there is no difference in the payment schemes for both types of services.
Conclusions: The service freed an average of 6 in-hospital days per patient. The program showed health value generation, as well as potential for synergies with community-based Integrated Care Services.},

	abstract = {Objective Prolonged exposure is characterized by reported dropout rates ranging from 25\% to 40\%. This premature attrition is also observed in other evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder. While home-based telehealth delivery of prolonged exposure resolves logistical barriers to care such as travel time and cost, dropout appears unaffected. A previous study on dropouts from prolonged exposure delivered via telehealth found that Veterans, particularly those receiving care via telehealth, reported problems with in vivo exposure and that having a peer to offer support during in vivo exposure assignments might have prevented their attrition from treatment. Methods The present pilot study treatment was designed in a manner consistent with the aforementioned Veteran suggestions, specifically to involve peers offering verbal support and encouragement during in vivo exposure homework. Such a treatment modification might be particularly useful for those receiving care via telehealth, given increased difficulties with exposure reported when this treatment delivery modality is used. It was hypothesized that dropouts would agree to reengage in treatment with a peer and would subsequently evince improvement in posttraumatic stress disorder and depression scores as a result of this treatment reengagement. Results Of 82 dropouts from prolonged exposure, 29 reentered treatment when offered peer support during exposure (12 in telehealth and 17 in person). Conclusion Treatment reentry was effective insofar as indices of both posttraumatic stress disorder and depression were significantly reduced in both telehealth and in person groups, indicating that using peers in this way may be an effective means by which to return Veterans to care, and ultimately reduce symptomatology.},

Welcome to the world of telemedicine and a patient-centered medical home (PCMH). Comprehensive health care delivered in the most efficient manner with the least expense is the cornerstone of these concepts. The concept of PCMH was first introduced in 1967 by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Council on Pediatric Practice in the book, Standards of Child Health Care. The medical home concept originally referred to one central source of medical records for children with special health care needs. During the past 4 decades, this concept has transformed beyond data entry to methods of delivering the best quality of care for all children. In 2007, a joint statement by the AAP, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, and the American Osteopathic Association endorsed the PCMH concept.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: It provides the global scale of the requirement, the number of Telemedicine Assistance Services (TMAS) calls handled by participating TMAS, the average direct and indirect costs incurred by both TMAS and ship operators, responding to medical emergencies, and also provides a calculation of the market size of about 760 million Euro/year. It estimates a return on investment per ship, of implementing telemedicine on board to meet the MLC and STCW requirements at less than 1 year.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: 1. There are both financial and soft benefits, such as crew retention and being perceived as a quality employer offering a telemedicine service on board. 2. It is quite possible to obtain a 20\% savings to the industry of perhaps 152 million Euro/year from the deployment of telemedicine on board. 3. The deployment of a telemedical service on ships is an opportunity to encourage further cooperation between TMAS and also with the private TMAS sector. 4. There is clearly a great need, on a global basis, for more cooperation, particularly in standardisation of pre-boarding medical files available, the equipmentrequired on board at a minimum, and level of service quality provided. 5. A collection of a common TMAS annual set of normalised statistics from the stakeholders in the maritime industry is needed. Should someone not be tasked with collecting this? 6. Open registries and countries where the private sector only providestele medicine, should be encouraged to work with the global public TMAS system and contribute to its costs?},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs and cost effectiveness of telehealth in addition to standard support and treatment, compared with standard support and treatment.
DESIGN: Economic evaluation nested in a pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Community based telehealth intervention in three local authority areas in England.
PARTICIPANTS: 3230 people with a long term condition (heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or diabetes) were recruited into the Whole Systems Demonstrator telehealth trial between May 2008 and December 2009. Of participants taking part in the Whole Systems Demonstrator telehealth questionnaire study examining acceptability, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness, 845 were randomised to telehealth and 728 to usual care.
INTERVENTIONS: Intervention participants received a package of telehealth equipment and monitoring services for 12 months, in addition to the standard health and social care services available in their area. Controls received usual health and social care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome for the cost effectiveness analysis was incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: We undertook net benefit analyses of costs and outcomes for 965 patients (534 receiving telehealth; 431 usual care). The adjusted mean difference in QALY gain between groups at 12 months was 0.012. Total health and social care costs (including direct costs of the intervention) for the three months before 12 month interview were £1390 (€1610; \$2150) and £1596 for the usual care and telehealth groups, respectively. Cost effectiveness acceptability curves were generated to examine decision uncertainty in the analysis surrounding the value of the cost effectiveness threshold. The incremental cost per QALY of telehealth when added to usual care was £92 000. With this amount, the probability of cost effectiveness was low (11\% at willingness to pay threshold of £30 000; {\textgreater}50\% only if the threshold exceeded about £90 000). In sensitivity analyses, telehealth costs remained slightly (non-significantly) higher than usual care costs, even after assuming that equipment prices fell by 80\% or telehealth services operated at maximum capacity. However, the most optimistic scenario (combining reduced equipment prices with maximum operating capacity) eliminated this group difference (cost effectiveness ratio £12 000 per QALY).
CONCLUSIONS: The QALY gain by patients using telehealth in addition to usual care was similar to that by patients receiving usual care only, and total costs associated with the telehealth intervention were higher. Telehealth does not seem to be a cost effective addition to standard support and treatment.

DESIGN AND METHODS: a pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial with nested economic evaluation. A total of 2,600 people with social care needs participated in a trial of community-based telecare in three English local authority areas. In the Whole Systems Demonstrator Telecare Questionnaire Study, 550 participants were randomised to intervention and 639 to control. Participants who were offered the telecare intervention received a package of equipment and monitoring services for 12 months, additional to their standard health and social care services. The control group received usual health and social care.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The analyses took a health and social care perspective.
RESULTS: cost per additional QALY was £297,000. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that the probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay of £30,000 per QALY gained was only 16\%. Sensitivity analyses combining variations in equipment price and support cost parameters yielded a cost-effectiveness ratio of £161,000 per QALY.
IMPLICATIONS: while QALY gain in the intervention group was similar to that for controls, social and health services costs were higher. Second-generation telecare did not appear to be a cost-effective addition to usual care, assuming a commonly accepted willingness to pay for QALYs.

	abstract = {AIM: Remote follow-up (FU) of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) allows for fewer in-office visits in combination with earlier detection of relevant findings. Its implementation requires investment and reorganization of care. Providers (physicians or hospitals) are unsure about the financial impact. The primary end-point of this randomized prospective multicentre health economic trial was the total FU-related cost for providers, comparing Home Monitoring facilitated FU (HM ON) to regular in-office FU (HM OFF) during the first 2 years after ICD implantation. Also the net financial impact on providers (taking national reimbursement into account) and costs from a healthcare payer perspective were evaluated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 312 patients with VVI- or DDD-ICD implants from 17 centres in six EU countries were randomised to HM ON or OFF, of which 303 were eligible for data analysis. For all contacts (in-office, calendar- or alert-triggered web-based review, discussions, calls) time-expenditure was tracked. Country-specific cost parameters were used to convert resource use into monetary values. Remote FU equipment itself was not included in the cost calculations. Given only two patients from Finland (one in each group) a monetary valuation analysis was not performed for Finland. Average age was 62.4 ± 13.1 years, 81\% were male, 39\% received a DDD system, and 51\% had a prophylactic ICD. Resource use with HM ON was clearly different: less FU visits (3.79 ± 1.67 vs. 5.53 ± 2.32; P {\textless} 0.001) despite a small increase of unscheduled visits (0.95 ± 1.50 vs. 0.62 ± 1.25; P {\textless} 0.005), more non-office-based contacts (1.95 ± 3.29 vs. 1.01 ± 2.64; P {\textless} 0.001), more Internet sessions (11.02 ± 15.28 vs. 0.06 ± 0.31; P {\textless} 0.001) and more in-clinic discussions (1.84 ± 4.20 vs. 1.28 ± 2.92; P {\textless} 0.03), but with numerically fewer hospitalizations (0.67 ± 1.18 vs. 0.85 ± 1.43, P = 0.23) and shorter length-of-stay (6.31 ± 15.5 vs. 8.26 ± 18.6; P = 0.27), although not significant. For the whole study population, the total FU cost for providers was not different for HM ON vs. OFF [mean (95\% CI): €204 (169-238) vs. €213 (182-243); range for difference (€-36 to 54), NS]. From a payer perspective, FU-related costs were similar while the total cost per patient (including other physician visits, examinations, and hospitalizations) was numerically (but not significantly) lower. There was no difference in the net financial impact on providers [profit of €408 (327-489) vs. €400 (345-455); range for difference (€-104 to 88), NS], but there was heterogeneity among countries, with less profit for providers in the absence of specific remote FU reimbursement (Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands) and maintained or increased profit in cases where such reimbursement exists (Germany and UK). Quality of life (SF-36) was not different.
CONCLUSION: For all the patients as a whole, FU-related costs for providers are not different for remote FU vs. purely in-office FU, despite reorganized care. However, disparity in the impact on provider budget among different countries illustrates the need for proper reimbursement to ensure effective remote FU implementation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Researchers and medical practitioners have long sought the ability to continuously and automatically monitor patients beyond the confines of a doctor's office. We describe a smart home monitoring and analysis platform that facilitates the automatic gathering of rich databases of behavioral information in a manner that is transparent to the patient. Collected information will be automatically or manually analyzed and reported to the caregivers and may be interpreted for behavioral modification in the patient.
METHOD: Our health platform consists of five technology layers. The architecture is designed to be flexible, extensible, and transparent, to support plug-and-play operation of new devices and components, and to provide remote monitoring and programming opportunities.
RESULTS: The smart home-based health platform technologies have been tested in two physical smart environments. Data that are collected in these implemented physical layers are processed and analyzed by our activity recognition and chewing classification algorithms. All of these components have yielded accurate analyses for subjects in the smart environment test beds.
CONCLUSIONS: This work represents an important first step in the field of smart environment-based health monitoring and assistance. The architecture can be used to monitor the activity, diet, and exercise compliance of diabetes patients and evaluate the effects of alternative medicine and behavior regimens. We believe these technologies are essential for providing accessible, low-cost health assistance in an individual's own home and for providing the best possible quality of life for individuals with diabetes.},

This resulted in an individual prediction for flare with associated treatment advice and test interval. In conventional follow-up the health check interval was left to the physician's discretion. The primary endpoint was cumulative incidence of disease flares. Secondary endpoints were percentage of participants with a positive change in quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
Results: We included 170 participants [84 telemonitoring; 86 conventional follow-up]. At 52 weeks the mean number of face-to-face visits was significantly lower in the telemonitoring group compared to conventional follow-up [3.6 vs 4.3, p {\textless} 0.001]. The incidence of flares [33 vs 34\%, p = 0.93] and the proportion of participants reporting positive change in quality-of-life [54 vs 44\%, p = 0.27] were similar. Mean annual cost-saving was €89 and increased to €360 in those compliant to the protocol.
Conclusions: Telemonitoring is as safe as conventional follow-up, and reduces outpatient visits and societal costs. The positive impact on quality-of-life was similar in the two groups. This strategy is attractive for teenagers and families, and health professionals may be interested in using it to keep teenagers who are well out of hospital and ease pressure on overstretched outpatient services.

In this randomised controlled study we investigated whether initiation of HMV at home in patients with chronic respiratory failure is non-inferior to an in hospital based setting.
METHODS: Seventy-seven patients were included, of which 38 patients started HMV at home. All patients were diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure due to a neuromuscular or thoracic cage disease. Primary outcome was the arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) while quality of life and costs were secondary outcomes. Telemonitoring was used in the home group to provide therapeutic information, for example; transcutaneous carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation and ventilator information, to the caregivers. Follow-up was six months.
RESULTS: PaCO2, improved by 0.72 (SE ± 0.16) kPa in the hospital group and by 0.91 (±0.20) in the home group, both improvements being significant and the latter clearly not inferior. There were also significant improvements in quality of life in both groups, again not being inferior with home treatment.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that initiation of HMV at home in a selective group of patients with chronic respiratory failure is as effective for gas exchange and quality of life as hospital initiation. In addition we found that it is safe, technically feasible and that more than € 3000 per patient can be saved compared to our standard care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health care maldistribution is a long-term problem in China. Telemedicine is an efficient way to deliver medical resources to remote areas; however, there are few studies on the effectiveness and challenges in providing health care from rural to urban areas in China.
OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe the effectiveness and challenges of telemedicine for providing health care from Guangzhou to rural areas in Guangdong Province.
METHODS: We designed surveys and conducted them immediately after the consultation and 2-4 weeks later. Data were collected from June 2015 to May 2016 including patients' demographic features, patient satisfaction, medicine effect, patient compliance, acceptability of prescription expenses, patients' desire to revisit the department, the top 10 diseases, and self-reported difficulties in telemedicine experience. The monthly average prescription expense was described using a line chart. The monthly consultation and prescription, as well as monthly prescriptions of Western medicines and herbs, were described using a bar chart.
RESULTS: Women comprised majority (45,386/67,740, 67.00\%) of participants and men comprised the minority (22,354/67,740, 33.00\%). The top 3 diseases were upper respiratory diseases (12,371/36,311, 34.07\%), laryngopharyngitis (4938/36,311, 13.60\%), and menstrual disorders (4669/36,311, 12.86\%). The monthly prescription for Western medicine was much more than that for Chinese herbs. The annual average medicine expense per prescription was 62.9 ¥. The participants' perception of expense was acceptable (8775/12,450, 70.48\%), mostly acceptable (2497/12,450, 20.01\%), accepted but somewhat expensive (980/12,450, 7.9\%), and unacceptable because of high cost (198/12,450, 1.6\%). The surveys on patient satisfaction demonstrated very satisfied (55,687/67,740, 82.21\%), satisfied (5891/67,740, 8.70\%), basic satisfaction (3561/67,740, 5.26\%), dissatisfaction (1454/67,740, 2.15\%), and no comment (1147/67,740, 1.69\%). Participants reported their treatment outcome as follows: full recovery (5008/12,450, 40.22\%), recovering (4873/12,450, 39.14\%), no effect (2153/12,450, 17.29\%), or worsening (416/12,450, 3.3\%). Approximately 89.01\% (20,240/22,740) of participants will revisit the department, whereas 10.99\% (2500/22,740) will not. Most patients complied with the doctors' advice completely (5430/10,290, 52.77\%), whereas the rest reported partial compliance (3684/10,290, 35.80\%) or no compliance at all (1176/10,290, 11.43\%). The participants reported poor computer skills (4980/22,740, 21.90\%), transportation inconvenience (4670/22,740, 20.50\%), unstable internet connection (3820/22,740, 16.80\%), language barriers (3708/22,740, 16.30\%), medication and medical hardware shortage (2459/22,740, 10.82\%), tiring commute (2068/22,740, 9.08\%), family care burdens (679/22,740, 3.0\%), and other unclassified difficulties (356/22,740, 1.6\%) as difficulties in using telemedicine.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine has a wide disease spectrum, similar to ordinary medicine in China. It saves costs, has high patient satisfaction and price acceptability, and can relieve disease and syndromes. However, certain problems need to be resolved. Telemedicine could be a feasible approach to address the health care maldistribution in rural China. This study may provide useful information for policy making and guidance for further telemedicine practice in China and other developing countries.},

	abstract = {We assessed a two-stage follow-up procedure for cardiac pacemakers, where in-clinic follow-ups were partly replaced by telemedical follow-ups. This was compared with the standard follow-up regime (in-clinic follow-up only). The new procedure required an electronic patient record, a telemedical follow-up unit for recording ECGs while the pacemaker was temporarily set to magnet mode, an ECG processing unit, and a reviewing and reporting unit. A total of 177 (86 female) patients were randomized to the control group and 182 (98 female) patients to the telemedicine group. In the telemedicine group, 234 telemedical follow-ups were performed. Out of these, 68 required an additional in-clinic follow-up, while 166 were sufficient for assessing the pacemakers' working status. During the study, there were 19 deaths in the telemedicine group and 20 in the control group. There was no significant difference between the two groups(P = 0.40). The probability that an individual patient's pacemaker would not to be replaced over time was analysed in a similar way to the Kaplan-Meier survival function. Fewer pacemakers were replaced in the telemedicine group (14) than in the control group (18), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.26). We conclude that alternating telemedical and in-clinic follow-ups brings no additional risks for patients. The follow-up procedure is feasible and interpretation of the pacemakers' magnet effect provides an easy-to-use, manufacturer-independent method of assessing the pacemakers' working status. This should reduce the patient load on pacemaker centres and decrease the overall costs of pacemaker therapy.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an information and communication technology (ICT)-facilitated depression care management program.
METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of the ICT-facilitated care (TC) delivery model was evaluated relative to a usual care (UC) and a supported care (SC) model. TC added automated low-intensity periodic depression assessment calls to patients. Patient-reported outcomes included the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey converted into quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire-calculated depression-free days (DFDs). Costs and outcomes data were collected over a 24-month period (-6 to 0 months baseline, 0 to 18 months study intervention).
RESULTS: A sample of 1406 patients (484 in UC, 480 in SC, and 442 in TC) was enrolled in the nonrandomized trial. TC had a significant improvement in DFDs (17.3; P = 0.011) and significantly greater 12-Item Short Form Health Survey utility improvement (2.1\%; P = 0.031) compared with UC. Medical costs were statistically significantly lower for TC (-\$2328; P = 0.001) relative to UC but not significantly lower than for SC. TC had more than a 50\% probability of being cost-effective relative to SC at willingness-to-pay thresholds of more than \$50,000/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: An ICT-facilitated depression care (TC) delivery model improved QALYs, DFDs, and medical costs. It was cost-effective compared with SC and dominant compared with UC.},

As such, recent reviews have called for refinement of their delivery with a focus on embedded strategies targeting client motivation. This research letter presents findings from an initial pilot trial conducted within Wales' National Exercise Referral Scheme (NERS), examining the feasibility of using validated physical activity monitoring devices and an accompanying online platform within standard scheme delivery. 30 individuals referred to generic or cardiovascular pathways were offered the system; of these 17 agreed to participate. Common reasons for declining were clustered into lack of technology literacy or access, condition severity, or fear of costs associated with losing the device. Analysis of follow-up interviews after 4 weeks of use indicated that while participants found the monitoring devices practical and informative, only a minority (n = 4) were using the system in full. Crucially, the system element most aligned with contemporary theories of motivation (the online portal) was not used as expected. In addition, feedback from exercise referral professionals indicated that there were demands for support from clients, which might be mitigated by more effective independent system use. Recommendations for larger scale trials using similar systems include consideration of targeted patient groups, equity of access, and providing adequate technological support that is currently beyond the capacity of the NERS system.},

An experienced CCRN-certified nurse manages the system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from Eastern Colorado Health Care System. The virtual ICU provides rapid response interventions through virtual technology. This tele-ICU technology allows for a "virtual handshake" by nursing staff at the start of the shift and a report on potential patient issues.

In addition, the tele-ICU nurse is available for immediate nursing consultation and support, coordinates point-to-point virtual consultation between physicians at the rural sites and specialists in Denver, and assists in expediting critical care transfers. The primary objectives for the tele-ICU program include improving quality and access of care to critical care services in rural sites, reducing community fee basis costs and frequency of transfers, and increasing collaboration and collegiality among nursing and medical staff in all Region 19's medical centers.},

Huntington disease, the classic example of an adult-onset hereditary disorder, is used to illustrate this concern and highlight the imperative of exploring novel mechanisms to improve access to effective genetic services. The components of an effective and practical solution strategy are outlined, including the development of innovative delivery systems such as telemedicine, web-based education tools, and cost-reduction mechanisms.

METHODS: A retrospective pre-post study was conducted to determine the impact of an electronic visit (e-visit) program targeting 2 groups of outpatients: adults with uncontrolled diabetes and warfarin-treated adults performing patient self-testing (PST) for monitoring of International Normalized Ratio (INR) values.
RESULTS: A total of 36 patients participated in the e-visit program during the 2-year study period. Among warfarin-treated patients, the percentage of INR values in the desired range increased relative to preenrollment values (from 62.5\% to 72.7\%, p = 0.07), and the frequency of extreme INR values (values of {\textless}1.5 or {\textgreater}5.0) decreased (from 4.8\% to 0.01\%, p = 0.01); the margin per patient was \$300 during the first year and \$191 annually thereafter. In the diabetes group, a decrease from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin values of 3.4 percentage points was observed at 5.7 months after enrollment (p {\textless} 0.001), with significant improvements in frequencies of statin use, aspirin use, and blood pressure control; the margin was \$100 per patient. The overall median patient satisfaction survey score was 39 of 40.
CONCLUSION: An online e-visit model for warfarin monitoring was an efficient, safe, and cost-effective method for implementing PST. Pharmacist-led management of diabetes through e-visits, often in combination with in-person visits, generated revenue while significantly improving clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common complication of diabetes and needs to be diagnosed early to prevent severe sight-threatening retinopathy. Digital photography with telemedicine connections is a novel way to deliver cost-effective, accessible screening to remote areas. Screening for DR in a mobile eye examination unit (EyeMo) is compared to traditional service models (i.e. local municipal services or a commercial service provider). The quality of images, delays from screening to treatment, the stage of DR, coverage of screening and the rate of visual impairment due to DR are evaluated.
METHODS: EyeMo utilizes telemedicine technology. The electronic databases of the hospital and information from the Finnish Register of Visual Impairment were used to determine delays and the rate of visual impairment.
RESULTS: Fourteen thousand eight hundred and sixty-six fundus photographs were taken in EyeMo in 2007-2011. Coverage reached 78\% of potential clients. No DR was detected in 43\%, mild background retinopathy in 23\%, moderate or severe background retinopathy in 31\% and proliferative retinopathy in 3\% of the evaluations. The quality of images was higher (p {\textless} 0.01) and delays shorter (p {\textless} 0.01) in EyeMo as compared to traditional service models. The rate of visual impairment due to DR decreased by 86\% in the area covered by EyeMo, and the change compared favourably to the situation in the entire Finland (p {\textless} 0.0005).
CONCLUSION: EyeMo is a feasible model of telemedicine application for screening of DR. Effective screening and timely access to care may indeed have influenced the reduced rate of visual damage.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemedicine in neurosurgery or teleneurosurgery has been widely used for transmission of clinical data and images throughout the country since its implementation in 2006. The impact is a reduction of patient number that need to be reviewed in the level III hospitals and an increment in the number of patients that are kept in level II hospitals for observation by the primary team. This translates to reduction of unnecessary transfer of patients and subsequently cost benefits for patients and medical providers. The main aim is to determine the amount of reduction in unnecessary transfer by the implementation of teleneurosurgery in the management of referrals to neurosurgical department in Hospital Sultanah Amninah Johor Bahru (HSAJB). Other factors associated with transfer decision are also evaluated.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted in HSAJB, Johor over four months. A total of 349 subjects referred to HSAJB are included with 12 subjects excluded. The subjects are followed up from the time of referral until three months post-referrals. Related data includes the decision before and after reviewing the radiological images on teleconsultation website with clinical data available.
RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the number of inter-hospital transfer. 37\% of transfer is avoided and patients are best kept in their original hospitals. However, there are additional findings in which there are 20.1\% of patients that thought does not require transfer based on clinical data alone, would have to be transferred when the clinical data and images are reviewed. This translates to an increment of 20.1\% need to be observed in neurosurgical center. Without the images, these patients might be observed in the referral hospitals with higher risk of deterioration. Other factors that are related to transfer decision apart from images include Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and diagnosis. The GCS significantly associated with transfer when only clinical data is reviewed. However, in situation where clinical data and images are reviewed together, the GCS and diagnosis are significantly associated with transfer decision. On multi-factorial analysis, more of mild head injury being transferred for observation in neurosurgical unit after images and clinical data reviewed which correlates to an increment from 1.85\% to 3.9\%. Another finding is reduced of risk of patients transferred for trauma from 1.85\% to 0.519\% after the data reviewed.
CONCLUSION: Teleneurosurgery is beneficial in the management of referrals from level II hospitals. The inter-hospital transfer is significantly reduced, however there is an increased in the number of patients that need to be observed in neurosurgery unit for the risk of potential deterioration.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2261-13-82},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical training has beneficial effects on exercise capacity, quality of life and mortality in patients after a cardiac event or intervention and is therefore a core component of cardiac rehabilitation. However, cardiac rehabilitation uptake is low and effects tend to decrease after the initial rehabilitation period. Home-based training has the potential to increase cardiac rehabilitation uptake, and was shown to be safe and effective in improving short-term exercise capacity. Long-term effects on physical fitness and activity, however, are disappointing. Therefore, we propose a novel strategy using telemonitoring guidance based on objective training data acquired during exercise at home. In this way, we aim to improve self-management skills like self-efficacy and action planning for independent exercise and, consequently, improve long-term effectiveness with respect to physical fitness and physical activity. In addition, we aim to compare costs of this strategy with centre-based cardiac rehabilitation.
METHODS/DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial compares a 12-week telemonitoring guided home-based training program with a regular, 12-week centre-based training program of equal duration and training intensity in low to moderate risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation after an acute coronary syndrome or cardiac intervention. The home-based group receives three supervised training sessions before they commence training with a heart rate monitor in their home environment. Participants are instructed to train at 70-85\% of their maximal heart rate for 45-60 minutes, twice a week. Patients receive individual coaching by telephone once a week, based on measured heart rate data that are shared through the internet. Primary endpoints are physical fitness and physical activity, assessed at baseline, after 12 weeks and after one year. Physical fitness is expressed as peak oxygen uptake, assessed by symptom limited exercise testing with gas exchange analysis; physical activity is expressed as physical activity energy expenditure, assessed by tri-axial accelerometry and heart rate measurements. Secondary endpoints are training adherence, quality of life, patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness.
DISCUSSION: This study will increase insight in long-term effectiveness and costs of home-based cardiac rehabilitation with telemonitoring guidance. This strategy is in line with the trend to shift non-complex healthcare services towards patients' home environments.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home-based exercise training in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has the potential to improve CR uptake, decrease costs and increase self-management skills. The FIT@Home study evaluates home-based CR with telemonitoring guidance using coaching interventions including strategies for behavioural changes with the aim to maintain adherence to a healthy lifestyle and to improve long-term effects. In this interim analysis we provide short-term results on exercise capacity, quality of life and training adherence of the first 50 patients included in the FIT@Home study.
DESIGN: The study design was a randomised controlled trial.
METHODS: Low to moderate risk CR patients were randomised to a 12-week home-based training (HT) programme or a 12-week centre-based training (CT) programme. In both groups, training was performed at 70-85\% of maximal heart rate (HRmax) for 45-60 min, 2-3 times per week. The HT group received three supervised training sessions, before commencing training with a heart rate monitor in their home environment. These patients received individual coaching by telephone weekly, based on training data uploaded on the Internet. The CT programme was performed under the direct supervision of a physical therapist. Exercise capacity and health-related quality of life were assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks.
RESULTS: CT (n = 25) and HT (n = 25) both showed a significant improvement in peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) (10\% and 14\% respectively) and quality of life after 12 weeks of training, without significant between-group differences. The average training intensity of the HT group was 73.3 ± 3.5\% of HRmax. Training adherence was similar between groups.
CONCLUSION: This analysis shows that HT with telemonitoring guidance has similar short-term effects on exercise capacity and quality of life as CT in CR patients.},

	abstract = {Aim Although cardiac rehabilitation improves physical fitness after a cardiac event, many eligible patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation and the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation are often not maintained over time. Home-based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve participation rates and enhance long-term effectiveness. Methods and results We randomised 90 low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation to three months of either home-based training with telemonitoring guidance or centre-based training. Although training adherence was similar between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home-based group ( p = 0.02). Physical fitness improved at discharge ( p {\textless} 0.01) and at one-year follow-up ( p {\textless} 0.01) in both groups, without differences between groups (home-based p = 0.31 and centre-based p = 0.87). Physical activity levels did not change during the one-year study period (centre-based p = 0.38, home-based p = 0.80). Healthcare costs were statistically non-significantly lower in the home-based group (€437 per patient, 95\% confidence interval -562 to 1436, p = 0.39). From a societal perspective, a statistically non-significant difference of €3160 per patient in favour of the home-based group was found (95\% confidence interval -460 to 6780, p = 0.09) and the probability that it was more cost-effective varied between 97\% and 75\% (willingness-to-pay of €0 and €100,000 per quality-adjusted life-years, respectively). Conclusion We found no differences between home-based training with telemonitoring guidance and centre-based training on physical fitness, physical activity level or health-related quality of life. However, home-based training was associated with a higher patient satisfaction and appears to be more cost-effective than centre-based training. We conclude that home-based training with telemonitoring guidance can be used as an alternative to centre-based training for low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {AIM: It is still unclear whether telemonitoring reduces hospitalization and mortality in heart failure (HF) patients and whether adding an Information and Computing Technology-guided-disease-management-system (ICT-guided-DMS) improves clinical and patient reported outcomes or reduces healthcare costs.
METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was performed testing the effects of INnovative ICT-guided-DMS combined with Telemonitoring in OUtpatient clinics for Chronic HF patients (IN TOUCH) with in total 179 patients (mean age 69 years; 72\% male; 77\% in New York Heart Association Classification (NYHA) III-IV; mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 28\%). Patients were randomized to ICT-guided-DMS or to ICT-guided-DMS+telemonitoring with a follow-up of nine months. The composite endpoint included mortality, HF-readmission and change in health-related quality of life (HR-QoL).
RESULTS: In total 177 patients were eligible for analyses. The mean score of the primary composite endpoint was -0.63 in ICT-guided-DMS vs. -0.73 in ICT-guided-DMS+telemonitoring (mean difference 0.1, 95\% CI: -0.67 +0.82, p=0.39). All-cause mortality in ICT-guided-DMS was 12\% versus 15\% in ICT-guided-DMS+telemonitoring (p=0.27); HF-readmission 28\% vs. 27\% p=0.87; all-cause readmission was 49\% vs. 51\% (p=0.78). HR-QoL improved in most patients and was equal in both groups. Incremental costs were €1360 in favor of ICT-guided-DMS. ICT-guided-DMS+telemonitoring had significantly fewer HF-outpatient-clinic visits (p{\textless}0.01).
CONCLUSION: ICT-guided-DMS+telemonitoring for the management of HF patients did not affect the primary and secondary endpoints. However, we did find a reduction in visits to the HF-outpatient clinic in this group suggesting that telemonitoring might be safe to use in reorganizing HF-care with relatively low costs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Peter Cerny Ambulance Service - Premature Eye Rescue Program (PCA-PERP) uses digital retinal imaging (DRI) with remote interpretation in bedside ROP screening, which has advantages over binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy (BIO) in screening of premature newborns. We aimed to demonstrate that PCA-PERP provides good value for the money and to model the cost ramifications of a similar newly launched system.
METHODS: As DRI was demonstrated to have high diagnostic performance, only the costs of bedside DRI-based screening were compared to those of traditional transport and BIO-based screening (cost-minimization analysis). The total costs of investment and maintenance were analyzed with micro-costing method. A ten-year analysis time-horizon and service provider's perspective were applied.
RESULTS: From the launch of PCA-PERP up to the end of 2014, 3722 bedside examinations were performed in the PCA covered central region of Hungary. From 2009 to 2014, PCA-PERP saved 92,248km and 3633 staff working hours, with an annual nominal cost-savings ranging from 17,435 to 35,140 Euro. The net present value was 127,847 Euro at the end of 2014, with a payback period of 4.1years and an internal rate of return of 20.8\%. Our model presented the NPVs of different scenarios with different initial investments, annual number of transports and average transport distances.
CONCLUSIONS: PCA-PERP as bedside screening with remote interpretation, when compared to a transport-based screening with BIO, produced better cost-savings from the perspective of the service provider and provided a return on initial investment within five years after the project initiation.},

This innovative approach to medical care delivery has been expanding for several years and currently covers various medical specialties.
OBJECTIVE: To facilitate installation of telemedicine systems/units in Greek remote areas, this article presents results of a cost-benefit analysis for two Greek islands, Patmos and Leros, using specific economic criteria.
METHODS: Net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and payback period were calculated, in order to monetize the economic benefits and the costs savings, estimate the depreciation of each project, and highlight the social benefits.
RESULTS: Costs were reduced (through saved air medical transportations) by €19,005 for Patmos and €78,225 for Leros each year. NPV and IRR were positive; NPV was €29,608 for Patmos and €293,245 for Leros, and IRR was 21.5\% for Patmos and 140.5\% for Leros. Each project depreciated faster than the 5-year life-cycle period, and specifically in 3.13 years for Patmos and in 0.70 years for Leros.
CONCLUSION: The establishment of telemedicine systems/units in Patmos and Leros was evaluated and assessed positively, with large savings, economical and social, gained by reducing or even removing the face-to-face contact between doctor and patient. Telemedicine systems/units seem to be a promising solution, especially in Greece, where the problem of primary healthcare services in remote/inaccessible areas is of great concern.},

To investigate efficiency, the time-investment of both therapists and patients were assessed. Seventy-one subjects were included in the study (36 in the intervention group and 35 in the conventional care group). Myofeedback-based teletreatment was at least as effective clinically as conventional care. Pain intensity and disability decreased after 4 weeks of treatment in both groups and part of the effect remained at 3 months' follow-up. The teletreatment also increased efficiency for therapists by almost 20\% and patients experienced the benefits of less travel time and travel costs by remote consultation.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate lifelong costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and renal transplantation (Tx) in Greece, based on individual patient life expectancy.
METHODS: A nationally representative patient sample on each modality, HD: N=642, PD: N=65 and Tx: N=167, was self-administered the SF-36 Health Survey, from which the preference-based SF-6D utility index was derived. Lifelong QALYs were estimated from literature-based expected remaining life years according to age, gender and modality. Cost analyses were performed from the perspective of the health system. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 5\% and sensitivity analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Estimated lifelong QALYs were 4.37 (HD), 3.94 (PD) and 16.11 (Tx) (P{\textless}0.001). Annual HD and PD costs per patient were estimated at euro36,247 and euro30,719 respectively. For Tx, average 1st year, 3-year and lifelong (undiscounted) costs were euro31,714, euro43,275 and euro151,274 respectively. Cost per QALY was higher in HD (euro60,353) compared to PD (euro54,504) and 1st year Tx (euro45,523).
CONCLUSIONS: HD is used by 75\% of the Greek ESRD patients, hence cost-saving efforts must be intensified. Reconsidering supply and reimbursement policies for dialyzers and drugs, establishing satellite dialysis units and adopting telemedicine in remote areas could be explored. Wider use of PD is also in the direction of increasing cost-effectiveness. Finally, efforts are required for disseminating the idea of organ donation.},

The audiologist was instructed to effectively image appropriate parts of the otolaryngology exam and create telemedicine cases that included clinical histories, images, audiograms, tympanograms, otoacoustic emission testing and/or other documents. The otolaryngology consultants reviewed new referrals as well as follow up cases and made treatment and triage recommendations. Over a 57 month period, 54 trips were made to 14 villages providing 197 clinic service days. The 1,458 patient encounters resulted in referral for surgery or special diagnostic testing 26\%, referral for monitoring 23\%, starting of medications 19\%, referral to regional ENT clinic 15\%, and referral to another specialty 5\%. Approximately 27\% patients did not need to see the otolaryngologist and were triaged out of the specialty clinic. The total cost to run this project was \$141,114. Travel was prevented for 85\% encounters, resulting in travel cost avoidance in airfare of \$496,420. These services were provided at a significantly lower cost and with fewer burdens to the patients when compared to the standard referral system. An audiologist that travels to remote locations and uses store-and-forward telemedicine can rapidly deliver otolaryngology services. This model is a proven mechanism of efficient healthcare delivery that may be expanded to other specialties.},

INTRODUCTION: To determine user friendliness, diagnostic quality, and service of commercially available mobile teledermatology apps.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All mobile teledermatology apps available at the Apple App Store were reviewed. The two most popular mobile teledermatology apps were identified and tested together with three apps having similar functionality using a single case of a patient who was also examined by a dermatologist in-person.
RESULTS: Apps varied in diagnostic scope, data gathering methods, services, rendered results, and in geographic coverage and cost.
DISCUSSION: None of the apps take a history as thoroughly as recommended by textbooks. Key medical questions like current medications and allergies are not asked often. Most apps rendered concordant results, except for the one having the least thorough history taking.
CONCLUSIONS: Mobile teledermatology application interfaces, services, and cost vary, with some risking medical errors and possible distribution of continuity of care. The American Telemedicine Association's guidelines for teledermatology need to address the use of direct to consumer apps. To protect consumers, app regulation, certification, or guidelines suggesting appropriate development and use might be considered.},

	abstract = {Background Previous reviews have investigated the effectiveness of telemedicine in the treatment of heart failure (HF). Dependent variables have included hospitalisations, mortality rates, disease knowledge and health costs. Few reviews, however, have examined the variable of health-related quality of life (QoL). Methods Randomised controlled trials comparing the delivery methods of any form of telemedicine with usual care for the provision of HF disease-management were identified via searches of all relevant databases and reference lists. Studies had to report a quantitative measure for mental, physical or overall QoL in order to be included. Results A total of 33 studies were identified. However, poor reporting of data resulted in the exclusion of seven, leaving 26 studies with 7066 participants. Three separate, random effects meta-analyses were conducted for mental, physical and overall QoL. Telemedicine was not significantly more effective than usual care on mental and physical QoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.03, (95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.05-0.12), p = 0.45 and SMD 0.24, (95\% CI -0.08-0.56), p = 0.14, respectively). However, when compared to usual care, telemedicine was associated with a small significant increase in overall QoL (SMD 0.23, (95\% CI 0.09-0.37), p = 0.001). Moderator analyses indicated that telemedicine delivered over a long-duration (≥52 weeks) and via telemonitoring was most beneficial. Conclusion Compared to usual care, telemedicine significantly increases overall QoL in patients receiving HF disease management. Statistically non-significant but nonetheless positive trends were also observed for physical QoL. These findings provide preliminary support for the use of telemedicine in the management of heart failure without jeopardising patient well-being.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of telehealth technology to enable real-time consultations between patients and specialist services (to whom travel may be an impediment to the patient's care) has recently been encouraged in Australia through financial incentives. However, the uptake has been both fragmented and inconsistent. The potential benefits for patients include access to a broader range of specialist referral services, cost and time saving, and more rapid access to specialist services and a continuum of care through the triangulation of interaction between patient, primary health care providers (general practitioners and nurses), and specialists. Enhanced broadband connectivity and higher-grade encryption present an opportunity to trial the use of telehealth consulting as an intrinsic element of medical education for both medical students and doctors-in-training within rural practices and Aboriginal Medical Services.
OBJECTIVE: This paper discusses the reported, and varied, benefits of telehealth consulting arising from a multisite trial in New South Wales, Australia. The purpose of this study is to encourage the use of selected telehealth consultations between patients in a primary care setting with a specialist service as an integral aspect of medical education.
METHODS: The trial closely followed the protocol developed for this complex and multiaspect intervention. This paper discusses one aspect of the research protocol--using telehealth consultations for medical education--in detail.
RESULTS: Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted. In the quantitative analysis, free-text comments were made on aspects of Telehealth Consulting for the patient, concerning the quality of the interactions, and the time and cost saving, and also on the leaning opportunities. Students commented that their involvement enhanced their learning. All respondents agreed or strongly agreed that that the interpersonal aspects were satisfactory, with some brief comments supporting their views. In the analysis of the qualitative data, five themes emerged from the analyses concerning the educational benefits of Telehealth Consulting for different levels of learners, while three themes were identified concerning clinical benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated strong synergies between the learning derived from the telehealth consulting and the clinical benefits to the patient and clinicians involved.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness and the cost utility of remote patient monitoring (RPM) when compared with the usual care approach based upon differences in the number of hospitalizations, estimated from a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed the literature published between January 2000 and September 2009 on multidisciplinary heart failure (HF) management, either by usual care or RPM to retrieve the number of hospitalizations and length of stay (LOS) for HF and for any cause. We performed a meta-analysis of 21 RCTs (5715 patients). Remote patient monitoring was associated with a significantly lower number of hospitalizations for HF [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.77, 95\% CI 0.65-0.91, P {\textless} 0.001] and for any cause (IRR: 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.79-0.96, P = 0.003), while LOS was not different. Direct costs for hospitalization for HF were approximated by diagnosis-related group (DRG) tariffs in Europe and North America and were used to populate an economic model. The difference in costs between RPM and usual care ranged from €300 to €1000, favouring RPM. These cost savings combined with a quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gain of 0.06 suggest that RPM is a 'dominant' technology over existing standard care. In a budget impact analysis, the adoption of an RPM strategy entailed a progressive and linear increase in costs saved.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel cost-effectiveness data coupled with the demonstrated clinical efficacy of RPM should encourage its acceptance amongst clinicians and its consideration by third-party payers. At the same time, the scientific community should acknowledge the lack of prospectively and uniformly collected economic data and should request that future studies incorporate economic analyses.},

Special focus lies on the link between the perspective of physicians (telemedicine users) and technicians (telemedicine designers) to find potential barriers hindering the broad application of telemedical systems in hospitals and doctors' offices.
METHODS: A survey among medical professionals (n = 34), technical professionals (n = 39), and a control group (n = 44) was conducted. The collected data were assessed in terms of domain knowledge, attitudes toward telemedicine, and potential implementation barriers.
RESULTS: Participants favored the conventional method over telemedical monitoring in regards to privacy, security, and time efficiency. In contrast, telemedicine was preferred with reference to efficiency of data analysis, long-term care, and emergency adequacy. Significant differences between the professional groups were found regarding perceived cost effectiveness, patients' compliance, privacy protection, and false alarm sensitivity. Medical professionals exhibited the most reluctance toward using telemedical treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: The perceived drawbacks are attributed to a general uncertainty about the reliability of telemedical systems, in combination with concerns about personal data privacy, security, and loss of control. The reported fear of not being able to correctly use and handle the systems assumes a low usability of devices. To acquaint medical professionals with the benefits and limitations of telemedical systems, telemonitoring and tele-treatment should be included in the education of medical personnel at an early stage.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In order to meet the future challenges posed by ageing populations, new technology, telemedicine and a more personalized healthcare system are needed. Earlier research has shown mobile radiography services to be highly beneficial for nursing home residents in addition to being cost-effective. Despite the benefits, mobile radiography services are uncommon in Europe and Norway. The purpose of this study was to explore success criteria and barriers in the process of implementing mobile radiography services, from the point of view of the hospital and municipal managers.
METHODS: Eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted with managers from five hospitals and six municipalities in Norway where mobile radiography services had been implemented. Core issues in the interview guide were barriers and facilitators in the different phases of implementation. The framework method for thematic analysis was used for analysing the data inductively in a research team.
RESULTS: Five main categories were developed through the success criteria and barriers experienced by the participants: national health policy, regional and municipal policy and conditions, inter-organizational implementation projects, experienced outcome, and professional skills and personal characteristics. The categories were allocated into three higher-order classifications: macro, meso and micro levels. The main barriers experienced by the managers were financial, procedural and structural. In particular, the reimbursement system, lack of management across healthcare levels and the lack of compatible information systems acted as barriers. The main facilitators were external funding, enthusiastic individuals in the organizations and good collaboration between hospitals and municipalities.
CONCLUSIONS: The managers experienced financial, structural and procedural barriers. The main success criteria in the process were external funding, and the support and engagement from the individuals in the organizations. This commitment was mainly facilitated by the intuitive appeal of mobile radiography. Changes in healthcare management and in the financial system might facilitate services across healthcare levels. In addition, compatible information systems across healthcare levels are needed in order to facilitate the use of new technology and mobile services.},

In order to provide safe and personalised care for nursing home residents during X-ray examinations, mobile radiography services have been implemented. The objective of this study was to analyse the costs of X-ray examinations and treatments for nursing home residents when comparing hospital-based imaging with a combination of hospital-based imaging and a mobile radiography service in Southeast Norway.
METHODS: A decision model was developed using the software TreeAge Pro. The model included two alternatives: the mobile radiography service in combination with hospital-based imaging and hospital-based imaging alone. The treatment needed based on the examination results could be given either in the nursing home or at the hospital. Probabilities and costs in the model were derived from previous research, various reports, and hospital data from the Southeast region of Norway. Monte Carlo simulations of 1000 residents were run through the model, and statistical analyses were applied.
RESULTS: The analysis showed a mean cost of €2790 per resident for the hospital-based service alone. For mobile and hospital-based services combined, the mean cost was €1946 per resident, including examinations and the immediate treatment given. This difference in costs was significant (p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A mobile radiography service in nursing homes provides a safe, high quality health care service. The result of this study showed there was a 30\% cost-reduction by implementing the mobile radiography service.},

	abstract = {As the very first trial of mobile telemedicine in the Republic of Georgia, in June-December 2010 we investigated 35 outpatients with different types of arrhythmia (male/female ratio=16/19; 12-80 years old), among them 5 patients with concomitant epilepsy. The control group comprised 7 clinically healthy sportsmen (soccer players, all men; 15-17 years old), during a 30-min velo ergometer stress test. A three-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) loop recorder (Vitaphone BT 3300; Vitasystems GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was used in automatic mode, using special LRMA software (MDT, Lázně Bohdaneč, Czech Republic) and a Nokia (Espoo, Finland) model 6730 Symbian phone. Automatically recorded arrhythmia events were transmitted from the loop recorder by Bluetooth(®) (Bluetooth SIG, Inc., Kirkland, WA) to a phone and then by 3G (through our partner mobile operator, MagtiCom Ltd. [Tbilsi, Georgia]) to the Vitasystems server in Germany and were available to Georgian physicians via e-mail/Internet. Arrhythmias were recorded/monitored during 7-68 h of observation. The number of automatically recorded ECG events varied between 3 and 170 per observation, or 0.4-10.7 hourly. Cases of sinus brady- and tachyarrhythmia, sinus node weakness syndrome, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, supraventricular premature complexes, and ventricular premature complexes were correctly recognized by automatic recognition software and recorded. In 3 patients and 1 sportsman previously unspecified (despite multiple investigations), arrhythmias were recorded: paroxysmal tachycardia (n=1), sinus node weakness syndrome (n=1), and ventricular premature complexes (n=2). In 3 cases (all women) light insomnia and nervousness were reported. In 2 patients with neurosis (both elderly men, 1 with epilepsy) we had to stop investigation prematurely because of anxiety/agitation. Mobile telecardiology represents feasible methodology to monitor arrhythmias in outpatients in Georgia, promoting earlier discharge of non-life-threatening cases, improving patients' comfort of life, and increasing their mobility with enhanced safety. Mobile telehealth might also represent significant cost-saving for insurance companies (this is an ongoing study). Finally, in remote areas mobile telemonitoring of patients will improve quality of care by timely provision of a second opinion in cases when local expertise is not sufficient.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine for the screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and identify changes within the demographics of a patient population after telemedicine implementation.
DESIGN: A retrospective medical chart review (cohort study) was conducted.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 900 type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients enrolled in a medical system with a telemedicine screening program for DR.
METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of the DR telemedicine program was determined by using a finite-horizon, discrete time, discounted Markov decision process model populated by parameters and testing frequency obtained from patient records. The model estimated the progression of DR and determined average quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved and average additional cost incurred by the telemedicine screening program.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, blindness, and associated QALYs.
RESULTS: The results indicate that telemedicine screening is cost-effective for DR under most conditions. On average, it is cost-effective for patient populations of {\textgreater}3500, patients aged {\textless}80 years, and all racial groups. Observable trends were identified in the screening population since the implementation of telemedicine screening: the number of known DR cases has increased, the overall age of patients receiving screenings has decreased, the percentage of nonwhites receiving screenings has increased, the average number of miles traveled by a patient to receive a screening has decreased, and the teleretinal screening participation is increasing.
CONCLUSIONS: The current teleretinal screening program is effective in terms of being cost-effective and increasing population reach. Future screening policies should give consideration to the age of patients receiving screenings and the system's patient pool size because our results indicate it is not cost-effective to screen patients aged older than 80 years or in populations with {\textless}3500 patients.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sub-Saharan Africa has a disproportionate burden of disease and an extreme shortage of health workforce. Therefore, adequate care for emerging chronic diseases can be very challenging. We implemented and evaluated the effectiveness of an intervention package comprising telecare as a mean for improving the outcomes of care for hypertension in Rural Sub-Saharan Africa.
METHODS: The study involved a telemedicine center based at the Yaounde General Hospital (5 cardiologists) in the Capital city of Cameroon, and 30 remote rural health centers within the vicinity of Yaoundé (20 centers (103 patients) in the usual care group, and 10 centers (165 patients) in the intervention groups). The total duration of the intervention was 24 weeks.
RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group had higher baseline systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and included fewer individuals with diabetes than those in the usual care group (all p {\textless} 0.01). Otherwise, the baseline profile was mostly similar between the two groups. During follow-up, more participants in the intervention groups achieved optimal BP control, driven primarily by greater improvement of BP control among High risk participants (hypertension stage III) in the intervention group.
CONCLUSION: An intervention package comprising tele-support to general practitioners and nurses is effective in improving the management and outcome of care for hypertension in rural underserved populations. This can potentially help in addressing the shortage of trained health workforce for chronic disease management in some settings. However context-specific approaches and cost-effectiveness data are needed to improve the application of telemedicine for chronic disease management in resource-limited settings.},

RESULTS: The major themes that emerged were experience of medical intervention, experience of rehabilitation, travel, and technology. Participants felt that medical practitioners had a lack of local knowledge and were concerned that delays in medical intervention resulted in ongoing impairment. They reported following the exercise program they were given, often modifying it to fit with their daily routine. Metropolitan therapists appeared to have limited understanding of issues relevant to rural and remote lifestyles. There was, quite often, no occupational therapist or physiotherapist at their local facility due to staff turnover, and, when available, they had limited experience in hand injuries. The distance and cost of travel to appointments were of significant concern. The use of telehealth or telerehabilitation received a mixed response.
CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the concerns regarding the provision of healthcare to rural and remote residents following a traumatic hand injury. These results provide the basis for recommendations surrounding the development of programs and service delivery models to address diverse needs in rural and remote areas.},

We also intended to verify the effectiveness of the developed programme.
METHODS: This study employed a quasi-experimental design with a repeated-measures analysis. We included five hospitals specialized in stroke care in Seoul Metropolitan areas. Seventy-three patients from these hospitals agreed to participate in this study.
RESULTS: The score of family caregiver burden decreased by 8.07 (±18.67) in the experimental group and increased by 1.65 (±7.47) in the control group, which was a significant difference (t=2.257, P=0.027) between pre- and post-intervention. The family caregiver burden of experimental group was significantly lower than the control group (F=3.649, P=0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: The home-based individual tele-care intervention, in addition to the hospital-based group programme, was cost-effective and supportive in reducing family caregivers' burden by providing relevant information for their needs in timely manner.},

We aimed to develop web-based digital cervicography system, and validate it compared with conventional film cervicography.
METHODS: A hundred cases from five centers were prospectively included, and cervical images (analogue, digitalized by scanning analogue, and digital) were taken separately using both analogue (Cerviscope) and digital camera (Dr. Cervicam) in each patient. Nine specialists evaluated the three kinds of images of each case with time interval between evaluations of each image. To validate novel digitalized system, we analyzed intra-observer variance among evaluation results of three kinds of images.
RESULTS: Sixty-three cases were finally analyzed after excluding technically defective cases that cannot be evaluable on analogue images. The generalized kappa for analogue versus digital image was 0.83, for analogue versus scanned image 0.72, and for digital versus scanned image was 0.71; all were in excellent consensus.
CONCLUSION: Digitalized cervicography system can be substituted for the film cervicography very reliably, and can be used as a promising telemedicine tool for cervical cancer screening.},

The liquid can be manipulated on the web-based user interface, and also can be observed by webcam feeds. Image streaming and web console servers run on an embedded processor with an expansion board. The UART channel of the expansion board is connected to an external Arduino board and a motor driver to control self-priming water pumps to sample the water, mix the reagent, and remove the water sample after the test is completed. The sensor node can repeat water testing until the test reagent is depleted. The authors anticipate that the use of the sensor node developed in this research can decrease the cost and required labor for testing samples in a factory environment and checking the water quality of local water sources in developing countries.},

	doi = {10.1111/srt.12415},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Very little is known about the methods of integrating palpation techniques to existing mobile teleskin imaging that delivers low quality tactile information (roughness) for telepalpation. However, no study has been reported yet regarding telehaptic palpation using mobile phone images for teledermatology or teleconsultations of skincare.
METHODS: This study is therefore aimed at introducing a new algorithm accurately reconstructing a haptic augmented skin surface for telehaptic palpation using a low-cost clip-on microscope simply attached to a mobile phone. Multiple algorithms such as gradient-based image enhancement, roughness-adaptive tactile mask generation, roughness-enhanced 3D tactile map building, and visual and haptic rendering with a three-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) haptic device were developed and integrated as one system.
RESULTS: Evaluation experiments have been conducted to test the performance of 3D roughness reconstruction with/without the tactile mask. The results confirm that reconstructed haptic roughness with the tactile mask is superior to the reconstructed haptic roughness without the tactile mask. Additional experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust against varying lighting conditions and blurring. In last, a user study has been designed to see the effect of the haptic modality to the existing visual only interface and the results attest that the haptic skin palpation can significantly improve the skin exam performance.
CONCLUSION: Mobile image-based telehaptic palpation technology was proposed, and an initial version was developed. The developed technology was tested with several skin images and the experimental results showed the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of the performance of haptic augmentation of real skin images.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Most children in the United States are evaluated in general emergency departments (ED), which are staffed by practitioners who care for both adults and children and may have limited pediatric resources. The application of telemedicine in pediatrics is growing and has been shown to be effective in outpatient as well as critical care settings. Telemedicine has the potential to address disparities in access to pediatric emergency care. The objective of this study was to explore experiences of general ED providers with telemedicine and their perception about a potential video telemedicine program with pediatric ED providers.
METHODS: Using qualitative methods, a purposeful sample of general ED providers (attending physicians and physician assistants) in 3 Connecticut hospitals participated in audio-recorded semistructured interviews. In line with grounded theory, 3 researchers independently coded transcripts, collectively refined codes, and created themes. Data collection and analysis continued in an iterative manner, past the point of theoretical saturation.
RESULTS: Eighteen general ED providers were interviewed. Three themes were identified: (a) familiarity with use in adult stroke patients but limited practical experience with telemedicine; (b) potential uses for pediatric telemedicine (guiding pediatric differential diagnosis and management, visual diagnosis, alleviating provider fears, low-frequency high-stakes events, determining disposition, assessing level of illness, and access to subspecialty consultation); and (c) limitations of telemedicine (infrequent need and implementation barriers).
CONCLUSIONS: General ED providers identified 7 specific potential uses of pediatric emergency video telemedicine. However, they also identified several limitations of telemedicine in caring for pediatric emergency patients. Further studies after implementation of telemedicine program and comparing provider perceptions with actual practice may be helpful. Furthermore, studies on telemedicine's effect on patient-related outcomes and studies on cost-effectiveness might be necessary before the widespread implementation of a telemedicine program.},

	doi = {10.2196/medinform.3872},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Access to health services is a particular challenge for First Nations (aboriginal Canadians) communities living in remote or underserviced areas. Teleophthalmology can provide them with the same level of retinal screening services provided to those in urban centers. This screening can lead to the identification of high-risk individuals who can then be monitored and receive treatment related to their diabetes or other health issues.
OBJECTIVE: The intent was to develop, implement, and evaluate a service delivery model for teleophthalmology screening and follow-up for at-risk and diabetic First Nations clients on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada.
METHODS: A highly consultative, culturally appropriate, and collaborative approach was used to develop and deploy a teleophthalmology service delivery model to First Nations communities. This project was evaluated with regard to utilization and operational costs. Also, clinicians and team members involved in the teleophthalmology project provided assessments of the teleopthalmology quality, productivity, and access. Health providers in First Nations communities provided their perceptions of areas of improvement for the remote retinal screening services, areas where expansion of services could be offered, and opportunities to increase client education and health promotion.
RESULTS: All 51 First Nations communities on Vancouver Island expressed interest in receiving teleopthalmology services. During the 1-year project, teleopthalmology clinics were held in 43 of 51 communities on Vancouver Island. During these clinics, 524 clients were screened and 140 of those clients were referred to a general ophthalmologist, family doctor, retinal specialist, optometrist, or other provider. Ratings of teleopthalmology system quality, information quality, service quality, and system usage were positive. Satisfaction with the teleopthalmology project was high among clinicians involved with the project. Satisfaction was also high among health providers in First Nations communities, with clinic scheduling identified as a potential area of improvement moving forward. The average cost savings per client, taking project costs into consideration, was calculated to be CAN \$28.16, which was largely due to the elimination of client travel costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Teleophthalmology was a welcome addition to health services by the First Nations communities on Vancouver Island, as evidenced by the 100\% rate of interest from those communities. There was no evidence of dissatisfaction by clinicians involved in the teleopthalmology project or by First Nations community health providers. The now-operational teleopthalmology program is a testament to the early success of the project.},

METHODS: Patients sent their blood glucose levels to physicians in local clinics. The physicians reviewed the blood glucose values online and provided personal consultations through text messaging or phone calls. Thereafter, a satisfaction survey on the ITGM service, the modified Morisky scale, and patient assessment of chronic illness care were administered.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventy patients from seven private local clinics used the ITGM. Overall satisfaction, including that about the ITGM service, the device, and its usefulness, was rated higher than "mostly satisfied" (score 4.2±0.8 out of 5.0) and even higher among the elderly. Satisfaction was positively associated with age, especially in those older than 60 years. The main reason for intent for future use of the service was the time/place flexibility. Highly motivated patients tended to answer positively regarding information satisfaction (P=0.0377).
CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to investigate ITGM satisfaction in private local clinics. The feasibility of users utilizing ITGM should be clarified, and future clinical research on the service's clinical effects and cost-benefit analysis is needed.},

METHODS: A comparative analysis was made based on reports and a thesis on the satisfaction rate of patients and providers, patient compliance to treatment, and economic assessment of Gangwon telemedicine service, which were carried out in three periods: the years 2006, 2010, and 2012.
RESULTS: The satisfaction surveys in all three periods showed similar results for patients (4.46±0.70 point) and healthcare practitioners, including nurses (3.82±0.62 point) and physicians (3.60±0.56 point), in decreasing order from the year 2012. Through the survey of patients' compliance with treatment, it was confirmed that telemedicine services increased patients' compliance with drug administration, facilitated improvement of lifestyle habits, improved glycated hemoglobin for patients with diabetes mellitus, and enhanced the rate of blood pressure control. In the survey conducted on patients' willingness to pay for telemedicine services in 2007, it was found that those patients were willing to pay about \$3.5 for services.

Questions were asked regarding their perceptions of telehealth, the key determinants of telehealth adoption and use, and recommendations they would give on telehealth adoption. The majority of the participants perceived telehealth as effective for managing symptoms and reducing cost. Meanwhile, some participants had a mixed feeling toward telehealth for depression care as they did not recognize their agency as equipped with the necessary resources and trained staff. Moreover, significant determinants of telehealth adoption included the agency-related characteristics, the patient-home environment, reimbursement and cost-related factors, and staff telehealth perception. Findings imply that there is a need for financial support both at the state and the federal levels to encourage telehealth adoption among HHC agencies.

However, a framework for assessment of these technologies is need by decision makers to assist them in choosing the most efficient and cost-effective technologies. Therefore in 2009 the European Commission initiated the development of a framework for assessing telemedicine applications, based on the users' need for information for decision making. This article presents the Model for ASsessment of Telemedicine applications (MAST) developed in this study.
METHODS: MAST was developed through workshops with users and stakeholders of telemedicine.
RESULTS: Based on the workshops and using the EUnetHTA Core HTA Model as a starting point a three-element model was developed, including: (i) preceding considerations, (ii) multidisciplinary assessment, and (iii) transferability assessment. In the multidisciplinary assessment, the outcomes of telemedicine applications comprise seven domains, based on the domains in the EUnetHTA model.
CONCLUSIONS: MAST provides a structure for future assessment of telemedicine applications. MAST will be tested during 2010-13 in twenty studies of telemedicine applications in nine European countries in the EC project Renewing Health.},

To meet the goal of this study, the following methodology which is consists of two main procedures was done: (1) Using a digital camera in order to provide a digital image from radiographs. (2) Using an image compression tool in order to compress digital images. The results showed that there is no significant difference between digital images (non-compress and compress images) and radiographic films. Also, there was a logic relationship between the diagnostic quality and diagnostic accuracy. Since the maximum percent of diagnostic accuracy can be seen among "Good" quality images and the minimum to was related "Poor". The results of our study indicate that a digital camera could be utilized to capture digital images from radiographic films of chest x-ray. To reduce the size of digital images, a lossy compression technique could be applied at compression percent of 50 or less without any significant differences. The compressed images can be sent easily by email to other places for consultation and also they can be stored with a smaller size.},

GSU counselors completed client severity rating forms. CC clients in ongoing therapy who were judged to be in need of psychiatric services were referred to the Tele-clinic (TC). CC counselors referred the most challenged students to TC according to total distress score on intake, clinician intake assessment of client difficulty, and client need for medications. After seeing the clients in TC, MCG residents also completed GSU CC client severity rating forms. Post-intake and satisfaction surveys already in use at the GSU CC were completed both by CC clients not in TC and by CC clients jointly enrolled in TC. TC and CC populations were compared by gender, race, past mental health treatment, past psychiatric hospitalization, and past and current use of psychotropic drugs. Telepsychiatry conducted using low bandwidth videoconferencing successfully supplemented GSU CC mental healthcare, especially for clients with the most serious problems, and did so without travel from campus and within the milieu of daily student life.

Using Cloud computing, radiology users can efficiently manage multimodality imaging units by using the latest software and hardware without paying huge upfront costs. Cloud computing systems usually work on public, private, hybrid, or community models. Using the various components of a Cloud, such as applications, client, infrastructure, storage, services, and processing power, Cloud computing can help imaging units rapidly scale and descale operations and avoid huge spending on maintenance of costly applications and storage. Cloud computing allows flexibility in imaging. It sets free radiology from the confines of a hospital and creates a virtual mobile office. The downsides to Cloud computing involve security and privacy issues which need to be addressed to ensure the success of Cloud computing in the future.},

	abstract = {Background: Neurological rehabilitation service in developing countries like India is a great challenge in view of limited resources and manpower. Currently, neurological rehabilitation with a multidisciplinary team is limited to a few major cities in the country. Tele-neurorehabilitation (TNR) is considered as an alternative and innovative approach in health care. It connects the needy patients with the health-care providers with minimum inconvenience and yields cost-effective health care.
Aim: The aim of this study was to study the socioclinical parameters, feasibility, and utility of TNR services in India.
Methodology: A retrospective file review of TNR consultations provided through Telemedicine Center at a quaternary hospital-based research center in south India between August 2012 and January 2016.
Results: A total of 37 consultations were provided to the patients belonging to four districts of Karnataka. The mean age of the patients was 34.7 (±19.5) years, 23 (62.1\%) were aged between 19 and 60 years, and 31 (83.8\%) were male. Thirty-one patients (83.8\%) had central nervous system-related disorders such as stroke, cerebral palsy, and tubercular meningitis with sequelae or neuromuscular disorders such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Twelve patients (32.4\%) were advised to consult higher centers in the vicinity, and the rest was referred to the district hospital.
Conclusion: The findings suggest that TNR services are feasible, effective, and less resource intensive in delivering quality telemedicine care in India. More clinical studies are required to elucidate its full utility at different levels and in different parts of the country.},

	abstract = {The Hajj, a mass-gathering of over 3.5-million pilgrims, faces challenges to global health-security, housing, food, water, transportation, communication, sanitation, crowd-control and security. The Indian Medical Mission extended health-security to approximately 140,000 pilgrims, through outreach medical teams, primary-care clinics, tent-clinics, secondary-care hospitals and evacuation capabilities. Data on medical attendance, bed-occupancy, investigations, referrals, medication usage and deaths was compared. Outpatient attendance was 374,475 in static-clinics, 5135 in tent-clinics and 13,473 through task-forces. 585 (62.90\%) in-patients were hospitalized amongst 930 secondary-care referrals. Secondary-care bed-days were 2106 with average bed-occupancy being 77.78\%. 495 patients were institutionalized in tertiary-care Saudi-Arabian hospitals. Infectious diseases were most commonly (53.26\%) encountered due to overwhelming respiratory-infections, followed by trauma (24.40\%). Analgesics (66.38/100 patients) and antibacterials (48.34/100 patients) were frequently prescribed. Crude mortality amongst Indian pilgrims was 11.99/10,000. Risk-factors associated with high morbidity were old-age and pre-existing comorbidities. Overwhelming surge of patients facilitates transmission of communicable infections and leads to stress induced physical, mental and compassion fatigue amongst healthcare personnel. Respiratory infections are highly prevalent and easily transmissible during Hajj leading to significant morbidity, increased burden to existing health facilities, overwhelming costs on health systems and globalization of multiresistant pathogens. Diabetic patients should avoid heat exposure and use protective footwear during Hajj rituals. Mass-gathering medicine at Hajj can be optimized by improving patient knowledge on performing Hajj at a younger age, medicine compliance, avoiding self-medication, self-monitoring of hypertension, blood glucose, and preventive health measures; screening of pre-existing comorbidities; and resource augmentation with telemedicine networks and decision-support systems.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.puhe.2014.10.010},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: With the number of people with sight loss predicted to double to four million people in the UK by the year 2050, preventable visual loss is a significant public health issue. Sight loss is associated with an increased risk of falls, accidents and depression and evidence suggests that 50\% of sight loss can be avoided. Timely diagnosis is central to the prevention of sight loss. Access to care can be a limiting factor in preventable cases. By improving referrals and access to hospital eye services it is possible to treat and minimise the number of patients with preventable sight loss and the impact this has on wider society.
CLINICAL PILOT STUDY: In 2005, NHS Fife took part in a flagship pilot funded by the Scottish government e-health department to evaluate the feasibility, safety, clinical effectiveness, and cost of electronic referral with images of patients directly from community optometrists to Hospital Eye Service (HES). The pilot study showed that electronic referral was feasible, fast, safe, and obviated the need for outpatient appointments in 128 (37\%) patients with a high patient satisfaction.
CENTRALISED OPHTHALMIC ELECTRONIC REFERRAL UNIT: The results of the pilot study were presented and in May 2007, the electronic referral system was rolled out regionally in southeast Scotland. Referrals were accepted at a single site with vetting by a trained team and appointments were allocated within 48 hours. Following the implementation of electronic referral, waiting times were reduced from a median of 14 to 4 weeks. Significantly fewer new patients were seen (7462 vs 8714 [p {\textless} 0.001]). There were also fewer casualties (1984 vs 2671 [p {\textless} 0.001]) and 'did not arrive' (DNA) new patients (503 vs 635 [p {\textless} 0.001]).
EYE CARE INTEGRATION PROJECT (SCOTLAND): In 2010 the Scottish Government Health Department committed £ 6.6 million to community and hospital ophthalmic services forming the Eyecare Integration Project in 2011. The main aim of this project was to create electronic communication between community optometry practices and hospital eye departments. Five electronic forms were specifically designed for cataract, glaucoma, macula, paediatric and general ophthalmic disease. A Virtual Private Network was created which enabled optometrists to connect to the Scottish clinical information gateway system and send referrals to hospital and receive referral status feedback. Numerous hurdles have been encountered and overcome in order to deliver this project.
DISCUSSION: An efficient unique system has been described within the NHS whereby the provision of eye care has been modernised by creating a user-friendly electronic interface between the community and HES. This system ensures patients are vetted into the correct specialist clinic and thus will be less likely to go blind from treatable conditions. Urgent conditions will continue to be prioritised and savings made with efficiencies gained can be re-invested towards better overall patient care.},

The utility of this approach has been exemplified by analysing the replay colour of the captured image of a holographic pH sensor in near real-time. Personalised image encryption followed by a wavelet-based image compression method were applied to secure the image transfer across a bandwidth-limited network to the cloud. The decrypted and decompressed image was processed through four principal steps: Recognition of the hologram in the image with a complex background using a template-based approach, conversion of device-dependent RGB values to device-independent CIEXYZ values using a polynomial model of the camera and computation of the CIEL*a*b* values, use of the colour coordinates of the captured image to segment the image, select the appropriate colour descriptors and, ultimately, locate the region of interest (ROI), i.e. the hologram in this case, and finally, application of a machine learning-based algorithm to correlate the colour coordinates of the ROI to the analyte concentration. Integrating holographic sensors and the colour image processing algorithm potentially offers a cost-effective platform for the remote monitoring of analytes in real time in readily accessible body fluids by minimally trained individuals.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a critical shortage of pediatric rheumatologists in the US. Substantial travel to clinics can impose time and monetary burdens on families. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost of in-person pediatric rheumatology visits for families and determine if telemedicine clinics resulted in time and cost savings. Factors associated with interest in telemedicine were also explored.
METHODS: Surveys were offered to parents and guardians of patients in Pediatric Rheumatology follow-up clinics in Kansas City, Missouri, the primary site of in-person care, and at a telemedicine outreach site 160 miles away, in Joplin, Missouri. Survey questions were asked about non-medical, out-of-pocket costs associated with the appointment and interest in a telemedicine clinic.
RESULTS: At the primary Kansas City clinic, the median distance traveled one-way was 40 miles [IQR = 18-80]. In the Joplin sample, the median distance traveled to the telemedicine clinic was 60 miles [IQR = 20-85] compared to 175 miles [IQR = 160-200] for the same cohort of patients when seen in Kansas City (p {\textless} 0.001). When the Joplin cohort was seen via telemedicine they missed less time from work and school (p = 0.028, p = 0.003, respectively) and a smaller percentage spent money on food compared to when they had traveled to Kansas City (p {\textless} 0.001). There was no statistical difference between the Joplin cohort when they had traveled to Kansas City and the Kansas City cohort in terms of miles driven to clinic, time missed from work and school, and percentage of subjects who spent money on food.
CONCLUSIONS: Traditional in-person visits can result in a financial toll on families, which can be ameliorated by the use of telemedicine. Telemedicine leveled the economic burden of clinic visits so that when the Joplin cohort was seen via telemedicine, they experienced costs similar to the Kansas City cohort.},

	abstract = {Telehealth technologies show tremendous promise in helping reduce health care costs by bridging distance and time. However, neither of the two competing visions for how telehealth should be used is scalable. On the one hand, remote telehealth care providers who triage or monitor patients, are not integrated into the health care system. They are outsiders, lacking access to the records of patients. On the other hand, face-to-face providers who provide the bulk of care in the health care system, are increasingly being asked to keep track of remote monitoring data and to manage patients remotely. They are insiders, but lack the time or training to manage patients remotely. In this paper, we propose a third way: integrate telehealth care providers into the primary care team as a virtual team. Being virtual, they can provide complementary services that patients need, but are not getting, such as peak and off hours care, off hours disease management advice, between-visit support and follow-up and remote device monitoring. We also describe the design requirements, issues and solutions for integrating telehealth technology into electronic medical record systems.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health records in our Center. The study sample comprised T2D patients enrolled in DTMS-based management, 30-75 years old, eligible for a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) target {\textless}6.5\% and actively participating in various components of DTMS such as regular reporting of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) values and dose adjustments via telemedicine. We analyzed HbA1c, lipid profile, and other parameters measured at the first visit and on subsequent physical visits at months 3 and 6 and estimated the incidence of hypoglycemia.
RESULTS: We analyzed records of 1,000 subjects with 6-month follow-up data (mean age, 53.2 ± 9.8 years; 64\% male). Patients had an average of 17 ± 2 telemedicine follow-ups and reported 66,745 SMBG values over 6 months. The mean ± SD HbA1c value was 8.5 ± 1.4\% at the initial visit and was reduced to 6.3 ± 0.6\% at 6 months (P{\textless}0.0001). The rate of SMBG values {\textless}70 mg/dL was approximately 0.04/patient/month, with 84\% patients reporting no hypoglycemia. The recurring extra cost to patient for DTMS, not considering cost of oral drugs and insulin, was equivalent to 9.66 U.S. dollars/month.
CONCLUSIONS: DTMS, based on telemedicine follow-up and multidisciplinary care with SMBG-based monitoring, appears to be safe and cost-effective in the intensive treatment of T2D without serious co-morbidities. This system also avoids limitations of a traditional health care such as the need for very frequent physical visits for each and every drug dose adjustment, diet, and exercise advice.},

	abstract = {Today's healthcare organizations are facing significant demands with respect to managing population health, demonstrating value, and accepting risk for clinical outcomes across the continuum of care. The patient's environment outside the walls of the hospital and physician's office-and outside the electronic health record (EHR)-has a substantial impact on clinical care outcomes. The use of big data is key to understanding factors that affect the patient's health status and enhancing clinicians' ability to anticipate how the patient will respond to various therapies. Big data is essential to delivering sustainable, highquality, value-based healthcare, as well as to the success of new models of care such as clinically integrated networks (CINs) and accountable care organizations.Sentara Healthcare, based in Norfolk, Virginia, has been an early adopter of the technologies that have readied us for our big data journey: EHRs, telehealth-supported electronic intensive care units, and telehealth primary care support through MDLIVE. Although we would not say Sentara is at the cutting edge of the big data trend, it certainly is among the fast followers. Use of big data in healthcare is still at an early stage compared with other industries. Tools for data analytics are maturing, but traditional challenges such as heightened data security and limited human resources remain the primary focus for regional health systems to improve care and reduce costs. Sentara primarily makes actionable use of big data in our CIN, Sentara Quality Care Network, and at our health plan, Optima Health. Big data projects can be expensive, and justifying the expense organizationally has often been easier in times of crisis. We have developed an analytics strategic plan separate from but aligned with corporate system goals to ensure optimal investment and management of this essential asset.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemedicine may facilitate the selection of stroke patients who require emergency transfer to a comprehensive stroke center to receive additional therapies other than intravenous tissue plasminogen activator.
AIMS AND/OR HYPOTHESIS: We sought to analyze frequency, patient characteristics, and specific therapies among emergently transferred patients within the telemedical Stroke East Saxony Network.
METHODS: We reviewed consecutive patients who were transferred emergently from remote spoke sites to hub sites. Certified stroke neurologists performed teleconsultations 24/7, with access to high-speed videoconferencing and transfer of brain images. Emergent transfers were initiated when considered necessary by the stroke neurologist.
RESULTS: In 2009 and 2010, we conducted 1413 teleconsultations and subsequently recommended transfer in 339 (24\%) patients [mean age 64 ± 14 years, 54\% males, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 5 (interquartile range, IQR 12). The mean teleconsultation-to-arrival time was 1·7 ± 0·8 h (median 1·6 h). Sixty-eight (20\%) transferred patients had a nonstroke diagnosis. The remaining 271 (80\%) patients had stroke diagnoses [ischemic stroke, 114 (34\%); transient ischemic attack, 8 (2\%); and intracranial haemorrhage, 149 (44\%)]. Forty (35\%) ischemic stroke patients received tissue plasminogen activator at spoke sites ('drip and ship'). Of the 240 stroke patients emergently transferred to the main hub site, 119 (49·6\%) received at least one specific stroke therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: A remarkable number of stroke patients can be transferred within a telemedical network to enable the delivery of specific stroke therapies that require advanced multispecialty expertise. Whether associated logistic efforts and costs have an impact on patients' clinical outcomes needs to be evaluated.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of telecare on health related quality of life, self-care, hospital use, costs and the experiences of patients, informal carers and health care professionals.
METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned either to usual care or to additionally entering their data into a commercially-available electronic device that uploaded data once a day to a nurse-led monitoring station. Patients had congestive heart failure (Site A), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Site B), or any long-term condition, mostly diabetes (Site C). Site C contributed only intervention patients - they considered a usual care option to be unethical. The study took place in New Zealand between September 2010 and February 2012, and lasted 3 to 6 months for each patient. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (SF36). Data on experiences were collected by individual and group interviews and by questionnaire.
RESULTS: There were 171 patients (98 intervention, 73 control). Quality of life, self-efficacy and disease-specific measures did not change significantly, while anxiety and depression both decreased significantly with the intervention. Hospital admissions, days in hospital, emergency department visits, outpatient visits and costs did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients at all sites were universally positive. Many felt safer and more cared-for, and said that they and their family had learned more about managing their condition. Staff could all see potential benefits of telecare, and, after some initial technical problems, many staff felt that telecare enabled them to effectively monitor more patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Strongly positive patient and staff experiences and attitudes complement and contrast with small or non-significant quantitative changes. Telecare led to patients and families taking a more active role in self-management. It is likely that subgroups of patients benefitted in ways that were not measured or visible within the quantitative data, especially feelings of safety and being cared-for.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The rising incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in adults and children has implications for the lifelong burden of disease and the provision of specialist services. Patients with IBD should have access to specialist care which is delivered according to their values and needs. Few studies have examined patients' views of follow-up care. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore patients' needs, preferences and views of follow-up care.
METHODS: IBD patients were selected from a gastroenterology clinic in a UK Hospital and invited to participate in interviews which focused on needs, preferences and role of follow-up, their experience of follow-up, service delivery, and other models of follow-up care.
RESULTS: 24 patients were recruited, 18 patients had Crohn's Disease, and 6 ulcerative colitis. Median age was 48.5 years (range was 27-72 years) and median disease duration 11.5 years (range 2-40 years). Four main themes emerged: (1) experiences of current follow-up care; (2) attitudes to new models of care, including self-management, role of general practitioner, patient-initiated consultations and 'virtual' follow-up; (3) the personal value of follow-up care; and (4) the 'ideal' consultation.
CONCLUSION: The main finding was that patients prefer a more flexible follow-up care system. 'Virtual' care as an adjunct to patient-initiated consultations and self-management, was identified as optimal approaches to meet the patients' needs of follow-up care. New models of follow-up care could improve the patients' experience of care, offer potential cost savings with reduction in face-to-face consultations and allow targeted care to those who need it.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe a quality improvement for referral of National Health Service patients with macular disorders from a community optometry setting in an urban area.
METHODS: Service evaluation of teleophthalmology consultation based on spectral domain optical coherence tomography images acquired by the community optometrist and transmitted to hospital eye services.
RESULTS: Fifty patients with suspected macular conditions were managed via telemedicine consultation over 1 year. Responses were provided by hospital eye service-based ophthalmologists to the community optometrist or patient within the next day in 48 cases (96\%) and in 34 (68\%) patients on the same day. In the consensus opinion of the optometrist and ophthalmologist, 33 (66\%) patients required further "face-to-face" medical examination and were triaged on clinical urgency. Seventeen cases (34\%) were managed in the community and are a potential cost improvement. Specialty trainees were supervised in telemedicine consultations.
CONCLUSION: Innovation and quality improvement were demonstrated in both optometry to ophthalmology referrals and in primary optometric care by use of telemedicine with spectral domain optical coherence tomography images. E-referral of spectral domain optical coherence tomography images assists triage of macular patients and swifter care of urgent cases. Teleophthalmology is also, in the authors' opinion, a tool to improve interdisciplinary professional working with community optometrists. Implications for progress are discussed.},

The overall response rate was 28.1\% (n = 123 responses), with email response rates being higher than postal mail responses. The most commonly reported barriers to in-person physician visits were parking cost (44\%), time away from work/school (34\%), and cost of gas (26\%). Whereas 89\% of respondents indicated using telephone and 55\% of respondents indicated using email to communicate with providers, none reported experience with video telemedicine. Despite this lack of experience, over 60\% reported feeling comfortable or willing to try it. Of those who were uncomfortable about video telemedicine, the two main reasons were that in-person visits feel more natural (48\%) and that the doctor might need to perform an examination (24\%). More than half of respondents reported willingness to pay a copay for a video visit. Video telemedicine represents a feasible option for chronic sleep disorders management.},

Organizations want to integrate mobile devices into their hospital information systems (HIS) due to the convenience to employees who are then able to perform specific healthcare processes from any location. The collection and merage of healthcare data from discrete mobile devices are worth exploring possible ways for further use, especially in remote districts without public data network (PDN) to connect the HIS. In this study, we propose an optimal mobile service which automatically synchronizes the telecare file resources among discrete mobile devices. The proposed service enforces some technical methods. The role-based access control model defines the telecare file resources accessing mechanism; the symmetric data encryption method protects telecare file resources transmitted over a mobile peer-to-peer network. The multi-criteria decision analysis method, ELECTRE (Elimination Et Choice Translating Reality), evaluates multiple criteria of the candidates' mobile devices to determine a ranking order. This optimizes the synchronization of telecare file resources among discrete mobile devices. A prototype system is implemented to examine the proposed mobile service. The results of the experiment show that the proposed mobile service can automatically and effectively synchronize telecare file resources among discrete mobile devices. The contribution of this experiment is to provide an optimal mobile service that enhances the security of telecare file resource synchronization and strengthens an organization's mobility.},

METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 36 HCPs from different disciplines such as pharmacists, nurses and doctors in South London. A convenience sampling technique was used whereby HCPs working in local trusts, community pharmacies and general practitioners surgeries were approached for participation. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes using the NVIVO 10 software.
KEY FINDINGS: The four main themes that emerged were awareness and understanding of telehealth, experiences and benefits of telehealth, barriers and facilitators of telehealth and misconceptions about telehealth. The study showed mixed response regarding telehealth awareness. Lack of telehealth experience was reported mainly among HCPs working in primary care. The barriers identified were cost and lack of funding and resources, whereas facilitators were raising awareness among staff and the public and investment in resources. Misconceptions identified were fear of losing face-to-face contact with patients and vital care information, patients' beliefs and confidence in using technology.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed experience and awareness level to be still low especially among HCPs working in primary care. Barriers and misconceptions identified are still the same as those reported in the literature which highlights that they have not yet been addressed to facilitate telehealth implementation in the UK.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The provision of patient information leaflets regarding telehealth has been perceived by potential consumers as a strategy to promote awareness and adoption of telehealth services. However, such leaflets need to be designed carefully if adoption and awareness among potential users is to be promoted. Therefore, the aims of this study were: first, to see how telehealth was portrayed in some of the existing telehealth leaflets (THLs). Second, to explore patients' perceptions of the existing THLs and their engagement with the concept and how THLs can be optimised.
METHODS: A two-step approach was employed to address the aims of this study. The first phase involved the use of discourse analysis to compare 12 electronically and publically available THLs, with the existing THL guidance "Involve Yorkshire and Humber". The second phase involved conducting 14 semi-structured interviews with potential telehealth users/patients to gauge their perception and engagement with the concept, using the two leaflets that were mostly matching with the guidance used. Six interviews were audio-recorded and eight had detailed jotted notes. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed to identify key themes.
RESULTS: The discourse analysis showed certain gaps and variations within the screened leaflets when addressing the following aspects: cost of the telehealth service, confidentiality, patients' choices in addition to equipment use and technical support. Analysis of the interviews revealed patients' need for having clear and sufficient information about the telehealth service within the THLs; in addition to, patients' preference for the use of simpler terminologies for telehealth description and the provision of clear simple texts with pictorial presentations. The interviews also revealed certain limitations against adoption of telehealth by the participants, such as: lack of privacy and confidentiality of information, fear of technology breakdown and equipment failure, loss of face-to-face contact with healthcare professionals and being too dependent on the telehealth service.
CONCLUSION: The current study showed a great variation among the screened THLs and highlighted certain gaps within the content and presentation of these leaflets. However, the study also highlighted certain key issues to be considered when designing THLs in the future to enhance telehealth uptake and use by patients.},

Virtual clinical encounters (VCEs) can now be conducted using widely available videoconferencing technologies. However, whether these technologies may be used to monitor postoperative recovery is unknown.
METHODS: In this pilot study, we provided care using a comprehensive "TeleDischarge" protocol to 15 patients after pancreatectomy. In addition to routine follow-up, all patients participated in two scheduled and an unlimited number of unscheduled VCEs using mobile hardware and secure videoconferencing software. We evaluated feasibility, patient satisfaction, postoperative adverse events, and health care human resource utilization.
RESULTS: The median age of enrolled patients was 63 y (range, 52-83 y) and 93\% underwent pancreatoduodenectomy. Twenty-eight scheduled VCEs (93\%) were completed successfully, and only one unscheduled VCE was requested. Twelve patients (80\%) felt their postoperative care was enhanced by VCEs and 14 (93\%) felt that VCEs should be a regular part of postoperative care. Minor interventions in four patients (27\%) were performed on the basis of clinical data gathered during a VCE. On a per patient basis, the TeleDischarge pathway was estimated to take 36 min longer and to have a direct labor cost \$39 greater than the standard pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Secure VCEs can be conducted using widely available hardware and software solutions. Although cancer patients support the introduction of mobile technology into postoperative care, further studies are needed to identify ways in which such technology can be used most effectively and efficiently to reduce barriers to recovery.},

Meeting these goals with didactic learning (DL) is becoming increasingly difficult. Enhanced training methods that would better prepare tomorrow's graduates must be more engaging and game-like, such as feedback based e-learning or simulation-based training, while saving time. Empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of advanced learning methods is lacking. Objective quantitative research comparing advanced training methods with DL is sparse.
OBJECTIVES: This quantitative study assessed the effectiveness of a computerized interactive simulator coupled with an instructor who monitored students' progress and provided Web-based immediate feedback.
METHODS: A low-cost, globally accessible, telemedicine simulator, developed at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel-was used. A previous study in the field of interventional cardiology, evaluating the efficacy of the simulator to enhanced learning via knowledge exams, presented promising results of average scores varying from 94\% after training and 54\% before training (n=20) with P{\textless}.001. Two independent experiments involving obstetrics and gynecology (Ob-Gyn) physicians and senior ultrasound sonographers, with 32 subjects, were conducted using a new interactive concept of the WOZ (Wizard of OZ) simulator platform. The contribution of an instructor to learning outcomes was evaluated by comparing students' knowledge before and after each interactive instructor-led session as well as after fully automated e-learning in the field of Ob-Gyn. Results from objective knowledge tests were analyzed using hypothesis testing and model fitting.
RESULTS: A significant advantage (P=.01) was found in favor of the WOZ training approach. Content type and training audience were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated the contribution of an integrated teaching environment using a computerized interactive simulator, with an instructor providing immediate Web-based immediate feedback to trainees. Involvement of an instructor in the simulation-based training process provided better learning outcomes that varied training content and trainee populations did not affect the overall learning gains.},

The DRMS used text messages or phone calls to remind patients to test their blood glucose and to report results via an automated system, with no human interaction unless a patient had severely high or low blood glucose. The DRMS made adjustments to insulin dose(s) based on validated algorithms. Participants reported medication adherence through the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8, and diabetes-specific quality of life through the diabetes Daily Quality of Life questionnaire. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted based on the estimated overall costs of DRMS and usual care.
FINDINGS: A total of 98 patients were enrolled (59 [60\%] female; mean age, 59 years); 87 participants (89\%) completed follow-up. HbA1c was similar between the DRMS and control groups at 3 months (7.60\% vs 8.10\%) and at 6 months (8.10\% vs 7.90\%). Changes from baseline to 6 months were not statistically significant for self-reported medication adherence and diabetes-specific quality of life, with the exception of the Daily Quality of Life-Social/Vocational Concerns subscale score (P = 0.04).
IMPLICATIONS: An automated system like the DRMS may improve glycemic control to the same degree as usual clinic care and may significantly improve the social/vocational aspects of quality of life. Cost-effectiveness analysis found DRMS to be cost-effective when compared to usual care and suggests DRMS has a good scale of economy for program scale up. Further research is needed to determine how to sustain the benefits seen with the automated system over longer periods.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prisoners can have difficulty obtaining subspecialty consultations. Telemedicine is used to provide diabetes consultations for residents of correctional facilities from our diabetes center. Telemedicine helps improve access to endocrinologists at reduced cost, but little outcome data are available.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of prisoners from 15 correctional facilities who received televisits for diabetes from 2011 to 2014 was performed. Demographic information, complications, medications, blood pressure, and laboratory results were collected.
RESULTS: At baseline (n = 106), mean age was 44 years, duration of diabetes was 15 years, 44\% had type 1 diabetes, and all were male. Only 64 of the participants had ≥2 video consultations; 58/64 had follow-up HbA1c results; and 53/58 were insulin requiring. Mean initial HbA1c was 9.3\% with an average decrease of 0.5\% from initial to final visit (a mean of 3.6 televisits). Patients with an initial HbA1c {\textgreater}9\% (n = 28) had an average drop of 1.3\%. Twenty-two subjects had initial elevated blood pressure; 20/22 (91\%) were prescribed angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-I)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB); and 15 of these 20 (75\%) had a final blood pressure {\textless}140/90 mm Hg over a mean of 3.3 televisits. 17/20 with high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were treated with statin drugs; 15/17 (88\%) had improved LDL on follow-up. Follow-up was limited by prisoner availability or visit cancellation by prison facility.
CONCLUSION: Improvements in glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control for prisoners with diabetes can be achieved with teleconsultations to correctional institutions. Given the high costs of transporting prisoners to healthcare facilities, telemedicine should be considered to help improve diabetes care for this vulnerable population.},

Repeated sessions are necessary in order to adequately evaluate a therapeutic effect. However, it is not feasible for many individuals with MS to visit clinic for treatment on a daily basis, and clinic delivery is also associated with substantial cost. We developed a research protocol to remotely supervise self- or proxy-administration for home delivery of tDCS using specially designed equipment and a telemedicine platform.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We targeted ten treatment sessions across two weeks. Twenty participants (n = 20) diagnosed with MS (any subtype), ages 30 to 69 years with a range of disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale or EDSS scores of 1.0 to 8.0) were enrolled to test the feasibility of the remotely supervised protocol.
RESULTS: Protocol adherence exceeded what has been observed in studies with clinic-based treatment delivery, with all but one participant (95\%) completing at least eight of the ten sessions. Across a total of 192 supervised treatment sessions, no session required discontinuation and no adverse events were reported. The most common side effects were itching/tingling at the electrode site.
CONCLUSIONS: This remotely supervised tDCS protocol provides a method for safe and reliable delivery of tDCS for clinical studies in MS and expands patient access to tDCS.},

Air transport is often the only feasible method for remote patients to reach few remaining burn centers. A significant proportion of flown-in patients have minor burns and are discharged within 24 hours, representing potential over-utilization of resources with increased cost to the healthcare system for no perceptible benefit. We explored factors associated with air transport of burns and opportunities for system improvement. Retrospective review of burn patients transferred by air to regional burn center between January 2003 and June 2013. Demographic, injury and clinical outcome data were acquired from the institutional Burn Registry. Minor burns constituted 17.7\% of all flown admits (236/1331). Children were more likely to be included in this cohort at 32\% vs 21.6\% of adults (P = .0004). The overtriaged cohort had significantly lower \% total BSA than accurately triaged cohort (3.3\% vs 15\%; P = .0001). Subjects with electrical burn injury were twice as likely to be overtriaged than accurately triaged (10.6\% vs 5\%; P = .002). The average \% total BSA in the overtriaged group was 3.3\%; the face was most common area burned (47.7\%). The average estimate of charges for transfer was between \$25,000 and 30,000/patient. The incidence of overtriage among flown-in burn patients, approximately 20\%, represents substantial unnecessary healthcare expenditure. Improved burn care education, incentives to increase use of telemedicine, and modification of American Burn Association guidelines to include consultation with a burn center rather than automatic transfer are needed to reduce this cost to the healthcare system.},

To ensure that interventions are timely and effective requires methods of screening and monitoring pathological changes, including assessing outcomes. Fractal analysis, one method that has been studied for assessing DR, is potentially relevant in today's world of telemedicine because it provides objective indices from digital images of complex patterns such as are seen in retinal vasculature, which is affected in DR. We introduce here a protocol to distinguish between nonproliferative (NPDR) and proliferative (PDR) changes in retinal vasculature using a fractal analysis method known as local connected dimension (D(conn)) analysis. The major finding is that compared to other fractal analysis methods, D(conn) analysis better differentiates NPDR from PDR (p = 0.05). In addition, we are the first to show that fractal analysis can be used to differentiate between NPDR and PDR using automated vessel identification. Overall, our results suggest this protocol can complement existing methods by including an automated and objective measure obtainable at a lower level of expertise that experts can then use in screening for and monitoring DR.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence and associated cost of treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unsustainable. Health care organizations are focusing on ways to support self-management and prevent hospital admissions, including telehealth-monitoring services capturing physiological and health status data. This paper reports on data captured during a pilot randomized controlled trial of telehealth-supported care within a community-based service for patients discharged from hospital following an exacerbation of their COPD.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to undertake the first analysis of system data to determine whether telehealth monitoring can identify an exacerbation of COPD, providing clinicians with an opportunity to intervene with timely treatment and prevent hospital readmission.
METHODS: A total of 23 participants received a telehealth-supported intervention. This paper reports on the analysis of data from a telehealth monitoring system that captured data from two sources: (1) data uploaded both manually and using Bluetooth peripheral devices by the 23 participants and (2) clinical records entered as nursing notes by the clinicians. Rules embedded in the telehealth monitoring system triggered system alerts to be reviewed by remote clinicians who determined whether clinical intervention was required. We also analyzed data on the frequency and length (bed days) of hospital admissions, frequency of hospital Accident and Emergency visits that did not lead to hospital admission, and frequency and type of community health care service contacts-other than the COPD discharge service-for all participants for the duration of the intervention and 6 months postintervention.
RESULTS: Patients generated 512 alerts, 451 of which occurred during the first 42 days that all participants used the equipment. Patients generated fewer alerts over time with typically seven alerts per day within the first 10 days and four alerts per day thereafter. They also had three times more days without alerts than with alerts. Alerts were most commonly triggered by reports of being more tired, having difficulty with self-care, and blood pressure being out of range. During the 8-week intervention, and for 6-month follow-up, eight of the 23 patients were hospitalized. Hospital readmission rates (2/23, 9\%) in the first 28 days of service were lower than the 20\% UK norm.
CONCLUSIONS: It seems that the clinical team can identify exacerbations based on both an increase in alerts and the types of system-generated alerts as evidenced by their efforts to provided treatment interventions. There was some indication that telehealth monitoring potentially delayed hospitalizations until after patients had been discharged from the service. We suggest that telehealth-supported care can fulfill an important role in enabling patients with COPD to better manage their condition and remain out of hospital, but adequate resourcing and timely response to alerts is a critical factor in supporting patients to remain at home.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac auscultation is a cost-effective, noninvasive screening tool that can provide information about cardiovascular hemodynamics and disease. However, with advances in imaging and laboratory tests, the importance of cardiac auscultation is less appreciated in clinical practice. The widespread use of smartphones provides opportunities for nonmedical expert users to perform self-examination before hospital visits.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess the feasibility of cardiac auscultation using smartphones with no add-on devices for use at the prehospital stage.
METHODS: We performed a pilot study of patients with normal and pathologic heart sounds. Heart sounds were recorded on the skin of the chest wall using 3 smartphones: the Samsung Galaxy S5 and Galaxy S6, and the LG G3. Recorded heart sounds were processed and classified by a diagnostic algorithm using convolutional neural networks. We assessed diagnostic accuracy, as well as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
RESULTS: A total of 46 participants underwent heart sound recording. After audio file processing, 30 of 46 (65\%) heart sounds were proven interpretable. Atrial fibrillation and diastolic murmur were significantly associated with failure to acquire interpretable heart sounds. The diagnostic algorithm classified the heart sounds into the correct category with high accuracy: Galaxy S5, 90\% (95\% CI 73\%-98\%); Galaxy S6, 87\% (95\% CI 69\%-96\%); and LG G3, 90\% (95\% CI 73\%-98\%). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were also acceptable for the 3 devices.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac auscultation using smartphones was feasible. Discrimination using convolutional neural networks yielded high diagnostic accuracy. However, using the built-in microphones alone, the acquisition of reproducible and interpretable heart sounds was still a major challenge.

Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with non-participating patient participants (n = 8) and stakeholders (n = 27) including clinicians, study investigators, and study staff. An analysis of interview data were undertaken and guided by a qualitative descriptive approach.
Findings: Patients and stakeholders reported many barriers to telehealth participation including technological barriers, limited understanding of disease, and an understated need for services. Both groups had some overlap in their concerns but also provided unique insights.
Conclusion: The analysis of study findings revealed perspectives of patients and stakeholders including barriers to participation as well as suggestions for future telehealth initiatives. Further research is needed to explore non-participation including patient readiness to assist in the development of future telehealth programs.},

	abstract = {ᅟ: We analyze one-year costs and savings of a telemedically supported case management program after kidney transplantation from the perspective of the German Healthcare System. Recipients of living donor kidney transplantation (N = 46) were randomly allocated to either (1) standard aftercare or (2) standard aftercare plus additional telemedically supported case management. A range of cost figures of each patient's medical service utilization were calculated at month 3, 6 and 12 and analyzed using two-part regression models. In comparison to standard aftercare, patients receiving telemedically supported case management are associated with substantial lower costs related to unscheduled hospitalizations (mean difference: €3,417.46 per patient for the entire one-year period, p = 0.003). Taking all cost figures into account, patients receiving standard aftercare are associated, on average, with one-year medical service utilization costs of €10,449.28, while patients receiving telemedically supported case management are associated with €5,504.21 of costs (mean difference: € 4,945.07 per patient, p {\textless} 0.001). With estimated expenditures of €3,001.5 for telemedically supported case management of a single patient, we determined a mean difference of €1,943.57, but this result is not statistically significant (p = 0.128). Sensitivity analyses show that the program becomes cost-neutral at around ten participating patients, and was beneficial starting at 15 patients. Routine implementation of telemedically supported case management in German medium and high-volume transplant centers would result in annual cost savings of €791,033 for the German healthcare system. Patients with telemedically supported case management showed a lower utilization of medical services as well as better medical outcomes. Therefore, such programs should be implemented in medium and high-volume transplant centers.

	abstract = {AIMS: Self-monitoring and self-titration of antihypertensives (self-management) is a novel intervention which improves blood pressure control. However, little evidence exists regarding the cost-effectiveness of self-monitoring of blood pressure in general and self-management in particular. This study aimed to evaluate whether self-management of hypertension was cost-effective.
DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort Markov model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken extrapolating to up to 35 years from cost and outcome data collected from the telemonitoring and self-management in hypertension trial (TASMINH2). Self-management of hypertension was compared with usual care in terms of lifetime costs, quality adjusted life years and cost-effectiveness using a UK Health Service perspective. Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of different time horizons and reduced effectiveness over time from self-management.
RESULTS: In the long-term, when compared with usual care, self-management was more effective by 0.24 and 0.12 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient for men and women, respectively. The resultant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for self-management was £1624 per QALY for men and £4923 per QALY for women. There was at least a 99\% chance of the intervention being cost-effective for both sexes at a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY gained. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses around the assumptions made, provided that the effects of self-management lasted at least two years for men and five years for women.
CONCLUSION: Self-monitoring with self-titration of antihypertensives and telemonitoring of blood pressure measurements not only reduces blood pressure, compared with usual care, but also represents a cost-effective use of health care resources.},

	abstract = {Introduction Telehealth approaches to health care delivery can potentially improve quality of care and clinical outcomes, reduce mortality and hospital utilisation, and complement conventional treatments. However, substantial research into the potential for integrating telehealth within health care in Australia, particularly in the provision of services relevant to older people, including palliative care, aged care and rehabilitation, is lacking. Furthermore, to date, no discrete choice experiment (DCE) studies internationally have sought the views and preferences of older people about the basic features that should make up a telehealth approach to these services. Methods Using a DCE, we investigated the relative importance of six salient features of telehealth (what aspects of care are to be pursued during telehealth sessions, distance to the nearest hospital or clinic, clinicians' attitude to telehealth, patients' experience of using technology, what types of assessments should be conducted face-to-face versus via telehealth sessions and the costs associated with receiving telehealth). Data were obtained from an online panel of older people aged 65 years and above, drawn from the Australian general population. Results The mean age for 330 study participants was 69 years. In general, individuals expressed strong preferences for telehealth services that offered all aspects of care, were relatively inexpensive and targeted specifically at individuals living in remote regions without easy access to a hospital or clinic. Participants also preferred telehealth services to be offered to individuals with some prior experience of using technology, provided by clinicians who were positive about telehealth but wanted all or some pre-telehealth health assessments to take place in a hospital or clinic. Preferences only differed by gender. Additionally, respondents did not feel that telehealth led to loss of privacy and confidentiality. Discussion Our findings indicate a preference amongst respondents for face-to-face pre-telehealth health assessments and, thereafter, a comprehensive telehealth model (in terms of services offered) targeted at those with some technological know-how as a substitute for attendance at hospitals and clinics, especially where these health facilities were far away from older people's homes. The findings may be usefully incorporated into the design of future telehealth models of service delivery for older people.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In many underdeveloped and third world countries, eye care is often neglected due to illiteracy. Particularly people in rural areas suffer with eye problems due to mal nutrition. The government is spending lot of money and efforts in screening the people at periodic intervals. One of the challenges faced by the doctors is screening the school children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The standard Snellen letter chart based diagnostic system does not work always. There are instances where the first few students who undergo this diagnostic system, memorize the letter sequence of the Snellen letter chart and convey the same to other fellow students. Hence other students simply read out the Snellen letter sequence from their memory, not by looking at the Snellen letter chart. Thus there is a need of randomizing the sequence of letters being displayed on the Snellen letter chart for every student to be diagnosed for eye testing.
CONCLUSION: In the present paper we are proposing a customizable, software based, cost effective solution which involves a standard personal computer (PC) fitted with a camera, headphone and speaker system. The envisaged system can be administered even by the trained persons. The proposed system is also suitable for remote diagnosis of patients, particularly in the field of telemedicine.},

A randomized controlled trial was carried out over four months with 45 patients treated with long-term oxygen therapy, 24 in the telehealth group (TG) and 21 in the control group (CG). The analysis took into account whether the severity of comorbidity (defined as the presence of additional chronic diseases co-occurring with COPD) was associated with differences in costs and/or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results of cost-utility analysis were expressed in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The average total cost was €2300 for the TG and €1103 for the CG, and the average QALY gain was 0.0059 for the TG and 0.0006 for the CG (resulting an ICER of 223,726 €/QALY). For patients without comorbidity, the average total cost was €855 for the TG and €1354 for the CG, and the average QALY gain was 0.0288 for the TG and 0.0082 for the CG (resulting in the telehealth programme being the dominant strategy). For patients with comorbidity, the average total cost was €2782 for the TG and €949 for the CG, and the average QALY gain was -0.0017 for the TG and -0.0041 for the CG (resulting an ICER of 754,592 €/QALY).

The high speed wireless RPM system will be an integral part of the mobile health (mHealth) paradigm reducing cost and providing better service to the patients. While the high speed wireless RPM system will allow clinicians to monitor various chronic and acute medical conditions, the reliability of such system will depend on the network Quality of Service (QoS). The RPM system needs to be resilient to temporary reduced network QoS. This paper presents a highly survivable bed pressure mat RPM system design using an adaptive information content management methodology for the monitored sensor data. The proposed design improves the resiliency of the RPM system under adverse network conditions like congestion and/or temporary loss of connectivity. It also shows how the proposed RPM system can reduce the information rate and correspondingly reduce the data transfer rate by a factor of 5.5 and 144 to address temporary network congestion. The RPM system data rate reduction results in a lower specificity and sensitivity for the features being monitored but increases the survivability of the system from 1 second to 2.4 minutes making it highly robust.},

Soldiers who have not been through telehealth screening report a strong preference for in-person screening. Soldiers who have been through telehealth screening still report preference for in-person screening, but they express more ambivalence about the screening method. Using telehealth-only mental health screening for large numbers of soldiers within a compressed time frame is more expensive than in-person screening. Telehealth resulted in higher referral rates than in-person screening. Government and military leaders should use care when making decisions about telehealth implementation. Although telehealth for small numbers may be sufficiently equivalent and economical, there is no evidence of cost savings or improved acceptability for telehealth mental health post-deployment screening.},

OBJECTIVE: This study describes views of residents of rural areas on accessibility to specialist care and the use of videoconsultation as tool to increase accessibility.
METHOD: A questionnaire was distributed via the primary health care centres in rural areas of northern Sweden. Data was analysed with both quantitative and qualitative methods.
RESULTS: The quantitative analysis revealed three main areas: savings in time, environmental damage and cost of not having to travel were important; security of information must be coupled with increased availability of specialist care; responses depended on an individual's specific health care needs. The open-ended answers resulted into two categories: 1) experiences related to availability of specialist care and 2) views on participating in VC.
CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that rural residents considered the distance as important factor in access to care, there was uncertainty regarding videoconsultation as solution. Although respondents were familiar with different types of communication technologies, they probably hesitated because they did not have information on what videoconsultation would mean to them.},

	abstract = {Background The efficacy of telemedicine in the management of patients with chronic heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40\% is poorly understood. The aim of our analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of a telemedicine-based intervention specifically in these patients, as compared to standard of care alone. Methods The Insuficiència Cardiaca Optimització Remota (iCOR) study was a single centre, randomised, controlled trial, designed to evaluate a telemedicine intervention added to an existing hospital/primary care multidisciplinary, integrated programme for chronic heart failure patients. 178 participants were randomised to telemedicine or usual care, and were followed for six months. For the present sub-analysis, only iCOR participants (n = 116) with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40\% were included. The primary study endpoint was the incidence of an acute non-fatal heart failure event, defined as a new episode of worsening of symptoms and signs consistent with acute heart failure requiring intravenous diuretic therapy. The healthcare-related costs in each study group were also evaluated. Results The incidence of the first occurrence of the primary endpoint was significantly lower in the telemedicine arm (22\% vs 56\%, p{\textless}0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.33 comparing to the usual care arm (95\% confidence interval 0.17-0.64). Telemedicine was also associated with lower mean overall chronic heart failure care-related costs compared to usual care (8163€ vs 4993€, p=0.001). The results were consistent in both left ventricular ejection fraction of 40-49\% and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50\% patients. Conclusions Our results suggest that telemedicine is a promising strategy for the management of chronic heart failure patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥40\%. These findings should be replicated in larger cohorts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In the state-of-the-art image transmission methods, multiple large medical images are usually transmitted one by one which is very inefficient. The objective of our study is to devise an effective and efficient multiple transmission optimization scheme for medical images called Mto via analyzing the visual content of the multiple images based on the characteristics of a recourse-constraint mobile telemedicine system (MTS) and the medical images; METHODS: To better facilitate the efficient Mto processing, two enabling techniques, i.e., 1) NIB grouping scheme, and 2) adaptive RIB replicas selection are developed. Given a set of transmission images (Ω), the correlation of these transmission images is first explored, the pixel resolutions of the corresponding MIBs keep high, the NIBs are grouped into k clusters based on the visual similarity in which the k RIBs are obtained. An optimal pixel resolution for the RIBs is derived based on the current network bandwidth and their corresponding areas, etc. Then, the candidate MIBs and the k RIBs are transmitted to the receiver node based on their transmission priorities. Finally, the IBs are reconstructed and displayed at the receiver node level for different users.
RESULTS: The experimental results show that our approach is about 45\% more efficient than the state-of-the-art methods, significantly minimizing the response time by decreasing the network communication cost while improving the transmission throughput; CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed Mto method can be seamlessly applied in a recourse-constraint MTS environment in which the high transmission efficiency and the acceptable image quality can be guaranteed.},

	abstract = {Detection of hypovolemia prior to overt hemodynamic decompensation remains an elusive goal in the treatment of critically injured patients in both civilian and combat settings. Monitoring of heart rate variability has been advocated as a potential means to monitor the rapid changes in the physiological state of hemorrhaging patients, with the most popular methods involving calculation of the R-R interval signal's power spectral density (PSD) or use of fractal dimensions (FD). However, the latter method poses technical challenges, while the former is best suited to stationary signals rather than the non-stationary R-R interval. Both approaches are also limited by high inter- and intra-individual variability, a serious issue when applying these indices to the clinical setting. We propose an approach which applies the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to the R-R interval signal to extract information at both 500 and 125 Hz sampling rates. The utility of machine learning models based on these features were tested in assessing electrocardiogram signals from volunteers subjected to lower body negative pressure induced central hypovolemia as a surrogate of hemorrhage. These machine learning models based on DWT features were compared against those based on the traditional PSD and FD, at both sampling rates and their performance was evaluated based on leave-one-subject-out fold cross-validation. Results demonstrate that the proposed DWT-based model outperforms individual PSD and FD methods as well as the combination of these two traditional methods at both sample rates of 500 Hz (p value {\textless}0.0001) and 125 Hz (p value {\textless}0.0001) in detecting the degree of hypovolemia. These findings indicate the potential of the proposed DWT approach in monitoring the physiological changes caused by hemorrhage. The speed and relatively low computational costs in deriving these features may make it particularly suited for implementation in portable devices for remote monitoring.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac disease is one of the main causes of catastrophic mortality. Therefore, detecting the symptoms of cardiac disease as early as possible is important for increasing the patient's survival. In this study, a compact and effective architecture for detecting atrial fibrillation (AFib) and myocardial ischemia is proposed. We developed a portable device using this architecture, which allows real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) signal acquisition and analysis for cardiac diseases.
METHODS: A noisy ECG signal was preprocessed by an analog front-end consisting of analog filters and amplifiers before it was converted into digital data. The analog front-end was minimized to reduce the size of the device and power consumption by implementing some of its functions with digital filters realized in software. With the ECG data, we detected QRS complexes based on wavelet analysis and feature extraction for morphological shape and regularity using an ARM processor. A classifier for cardiac disease was constructed based on features extracted from a training dataset using support vector machines. The classifier then categorized the ECG data into normal beats, AFib, and myocardial ischemia.
RESULTS: A portable ECG device was implemented, and successfully acquired and processed ECG signals. The performance of this device was also verified by comparing the processed ECG data with high-quality ECG data from a public cardiac database. Because of reduced computational complexity, the ARM processor was able to process up to a thousand samples per second, and this allowed real-time acquisition and diagnosis of heart disease. Experimental results for detection of heart disease showed that the device classified AFib and ischemia with a sensitivity of 95.1\% and a specificity of 95.9\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Current home care and telemedicine systems have a separate device and diagnostic service system, which results in additional time and cost. Our proposed portable ECG device provides captured ECG data and suspected waveform to identify sporadic and chronic events of heart diseases. This device has been built and evaluated for high quality of signals, low computational complexity, and accurate detection.},

We conducted a mixed methods study that assessed practical feasibility, determined performance, and explored users' acceptability of supervision via tele-US. Technical performance was assessed quantitatively by the ratio in mean gray value between images on site and as received by the supervisor, and by after-compression frame rate. Qualitatively, 12 exploratory semi-structured interviews were conducted with exposed junior doctors and supervisors. Remote supervision via tele-US was performed with 10 junior doctors scanning 45 included patients. During performance assessment, neither alternating internet connection nor software significantly changed the mean gray value ratio. The lowest median frame rate of 4.6 (interquartile range [IQR]: 3.1-5.0) was found by using a 4G internet connection; the highest of 28.5 (IQR: 28.5-29.0) was found with alternative computer and local area network internet connection. In interviews, supervisors stressed the importance of preserving frame rate, and junior doctors emphasized a need for shared ultrasound terminology. In the qualitative analysis, setup mobility, accessibility, and time consumption were emphasized as being of key importance for future clinical implementations. Remote supervision via a commercially available and low-cost tele-US setup is operational for both junior doctors and supervisors when applied to lung and cardiac POCUS scans of hospitalized patients.},

Our current healthcare models may not be adequate to handle this shift in demography, which may have serious consequences for the ageing population who are more prone to chronic diseases. One proposed remediation is to provide in-home assisted healthcare with technology-intervened approaches. Telemedicine, telehealth, e-health are paradigms found in scientific literature that provide clinical treatment through a technology intervention. In evidence-based medical science, these technology interventions are evaluated through clinical trials, which are targeted to measure improvements in medical conditions and the treatment's cost effectiveness. However, effectiveness of a technology also depends on the interaction pattern between the technology and its' users, especially the patients. This paper presents (1) a meta-synthesis of clinical trials for technology-intervened treatments of type 2 diabetes and (2) the Clinical User-Experience Evaluation (CUE). CUE is a recommendation for future telemedicine clinical trials that focuses on the patient as the user from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective and was developed as part of this research. The clinical trials reviewed were interpreted from a technology perspective and the non-medical or non-biological improvements of the users (patients) rather than the medical outcome. Results show that technology-intervened treatments provide positive behavior changes among patients and are potentially highly beneficial for chronic illness management such as type 2 diabetes. The results from the CUE method show how it complements clinical trials to capture patients' interaction with a technology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telehealth interventions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have focused primarily on stable outpatients. Telehealth designed to handle the acute exacerbation that normally requires hospitalization could also be of interest. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of home-based telehealth hospitalization with conventional hospitalization for exacerbation in severe COPD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-center, noninferiority, randomized, controlled effectiveness trial was conducted between June 2010 and December 2011. Patients with severe COPD admitted because of exacerbation were randomized 1:1 either to home-based telehealth hospitalization or to continue standard treatment and care at the hospital. The primary outcome was treatment failure defined as re-admission due to exacerbation in COPD within 30 days after initial discharge. The noninferiority margin was set at 20\% of the control group's risk of re-admission. Secondary outcomes were mortality, need for manual or mechanical ventilation or noninvasive ventilation, length of hospitalization, physiological parameters, health-related quality of life, user satisfaction, healthcare costs, and adverse events.
RESULTS: In total, 57 patients were randomized: 29 participants in the telehealth group and 28 participants in the control group. Testing the incidence of re-admission within 30 days after discharge could not confirm noninferiority (lower 95\% confidence limit [CL], -24.8\%; p=0.35). Results were also nonsignificant at 90 days (lower 95\% CL, -16.2\%; p=0.33) and 180 days (lower 95\% CL, -16.6\%; p =0.33) after discharge. Superiority testing on secondary outcomes showed nonsignificant differences between groups. Healthcare costs have not yet been evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: Whether home-based telehealth hospitalization is noninferior to conventional hospitalization requires further investigation. The results indicate that a subgroup of patients with severe COPD can be treated for acute exacerbation at home using telehealth, without the physical presence of health professionals and with a proper organizational "back-up."},

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall, both bases presented similar technology usage patterns in terms of computer and mobile device usage on the Internet. Air Force base parents had a slightly higher knowledge level of nutrition/health information than Army base parents.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this report is to determine whether behavioural interventions are effective in improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.
BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a serious chronic condition affecting millions of people worldwide and is the sixth leading cause of death in Canada. In 2005, an estimated 8.8\% of Ontario's population had diabetes, representing more than 816,000 Ontarians. The direct health care cost of diabetes was \$1.76 billion in the year 2000 and is projected to rise to a total cost of \$3.14 billion by 2016. Much of this cost arises from the serious long-term complications associated with the disease including: coronary heart disease, stroke, adult blindness, limb amputations and kidney disease. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90-95\% of diabetes and while type 2 diabetes is more prevalent in people aged 40 years and older, prevalence in younger populations is increasing due to a rise in obesity and physical inactivity in children. Data from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) has shown that tight glycemic control can significantly reduce the risk of developing serious complications in type 2 diabetics. Despite physicians' and patients' knowledge of the importance of glycemic control, Canadian data has shown that only 38\% of patients with diabetes have HbA1C levels in the optimal range of 7\% or less. This statistic highlights the complexities involved in the management of diabetes, which is characterized by extensive patient involvement in addition to the support provided by physicians. An enormous demand is, therefore, placed on patients to self-manage the physical, emotional and psychological aspects of living with a chronic illness. Despite differences in individual needs to cope with diabetes, there is general agreement for the necessity of supportive programs for patient self-management. While traditional programs were didactic models with the goal of improving patients' knowledge of their disease, current models focus on behavioural approaches aimed at providing patients with the skills and strategies required to promote and change their behaviour. Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews have demonstrated improved health outcomes with self-management support programs in type 2 diabetics. They have all, however, either looked at a specific component of self-management support programs (i.e. self-management education) or have been conducted in specific populations. Most reviews are also qualitative and do not clearly define the interventions of interest, making findings difficult to interpret. Moreover, heterogeneity in the interventions has led to conflicting evidence on the components of effective programs. There is thus much uncertainty regarding the optimal design and delivery of these programs by policymakers. EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS OF EFFECTIVENESS:
RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Are behavioural interventions effective in improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes?Is the effectiveness of the intervention impacted by intervention characteristics (e.g. delivery of intervention, length of intervention, mode of instruction, interventionist etc.)?
INCLUSION CRITERIA: English Language Published between January 1996 to August 2008 Type 2 diabetic adult population ({\textgreater}18 years)Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)Systematic reviews, or meta-analyses Describing a multi-faceted self-management support intervention as defined by the 2007 Self-Management Mapping Guide (1)Reporting outcomes of glycemic control (HbA1c) with extractable data Studies with a minimum of 6-month follow up
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies with a control group other than usual care Studies with a sample size {\textless}30 Studies without a clearly defined intervention
OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: PRIMARY OUTCOME: glycemic control (HbA1c)
SECONDARY OUTCOMES: systolic blood pressure (SBP) control, lipid control, change in smoking status, weight change, quality of life, knowledge, self-efficacy, managing psychosocial aspects of diabetes, assessing dissatisfaction and readiness to change, and setting and achieving diabetes goals.
SEARCH STRATEGY: A search was performed in OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing \& Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), The Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published between January 1996 and August 2008. Abstracts were reviewed by a single author and studies meeting the inclusion criteria outlined above were obtained. Data on population characteristics, glycemic control outcomes, and study design were extracted. Reference lists were also checked for relevant studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed as being either high, moderate, low, or very low according to the GRADE methodology.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The search identified 638 citations published between 1996 and August 2008, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria and one was a meta-analysis (Gary et al. 2003). The remaining 11 studies were RCTs (9 were used in the meta-analysis) and only one was defined as small (total sample size N=47). SUMMARY OF PARTICIPANT DEMOGRAPHICS ACROSS STUDIES: A total of 2,549 participants were included in the 11 identified studies. The mean age of participants reported was approximately 58 years and the mean duration of diabetes was approximately 6 years. Most studies reported gender with a mean percentage of females of approximately 67\%. Of the eleven studies, two focused only on women and four included only Hispanic individuals. All studies evaluated type 2 diabetes patients exclusively. STUDY CHARACTERISTICS: The studies were conducted between 2002 and 2008. Approximately six of 11 studies were carried out within the USA, with the remaining studies conducted in the UK, Sweden, and Israel (sample size ranged from 47 to 824 participants). The quality of the studies ranged from moderate to low with four of the studies being of moderate quality and the remaining seven of low quality (based on the Consort Checklist). Differences in quality were mainly due to methodological issues such as inadequate description of randomization, sample size calculation allocation concealment, blinding and uncertainty of the use of intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Patients were recruited from several settings: six studies from primary or general medical practices, three studies from the community (e.g. via advertisements), and two from outpatient diabetes clinics. A usual care control group was reported in nine of 11 of the studies and two studies reported some type of minimal diabetes care in addition to usual care for the control group. INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS: All of the interventions examined in the studies were mapped to the 2007 Self-management Mapping Guide. The interventions most often focused on problem solving, goal setting and encouraging participants to engage in activities that protect and promote health (e.g. modifying behaviour, change in diet, and increase physical activity). All of the studies examined comprehensive interventions targeted at least two self-care topics (e.g. diet, physical activity, blood glucose monitoring, foot care, etc.). Despite the homogeneity in the aims of the interventions, there was substantial clinical heterogeneity in other intervention characteristics such as duration, intensity, setting, mode of delivery (group vs. individual), interventionist, and outcomes of interest (discussed below). DURATION, INTENSITY AND MODE OF DELIVERY: Intervention durations ranged from 2 days to 1 year, with many falling into the range of 6 to 10 weeks. The rest of the interventions fell into categories of ≤ 2 weeks (2 studies), 6 months (2 studies), or 1 year (3 studies). Intensity of the interventions varied widely from 6 hours over 2 days, to 52 hours over 1 year; however, the majority consisted of interventions of 6 to 15 hours. Both individual and group sessions were used to deliver interventions. Group counselling was used in five studies as a mode of instruction, three studies used both individual and group sessions, and one study used individual sessions as its sole mode of instruction.

CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION Obesity is defined as an excessive accumulation of body fat as measured by the body mass index (BMI) and calculated as body weight in kilograms (kg) divided by height in metres squared (m(2)). People with a BMI over 30 kg/m(2) are considered obese in most countries. The condition is associated with the development of several diseases, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes), hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and cancers of the breast, uterus, prostate, and colon. Clinically severe, or morbid obesity, is commonly defined by a BMI of at least 40 kg/m(2), or a BMI of at least 35 kg/m(2) if there are comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or arthritis. The prevalence of morbid obesity among people with type 2 diabetes has been examined and of 2,460 patients with type 2 diabetes, 52\% (n = 1,279) were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) and 23\% (n = 561) had a BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2).  BARIATRIC SURGERY: Men and women with morbid obesity may be eligible for surgical intervention. There are numerous surgical options available, all of which can be divided into two general types, both of which can be performed either as open surgery or laparoscopically: malabsorptive - bypassing parts of the gastrointestinal tract to limit the absorption of food, andrestrictive - decreasing the size of the stomach in order for the patient to feel satiated with a smaller amount foodSurgery for morbid obesity is usually considered a last resort for people who have attempted first-line medical management (e.g. diet, behaviour modification, increased physical activity, and drugs) but who have not lost weight permanently. Surgery is restricted to people with morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2)) or those with a BMI of at least 35 kg/m(2) and serious comorbid conditions.
EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS METHODS: Details of the full literature search can be found in the 2005 evidence-based analysis of bariatric surgery (http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/tech/techmn.html). Briefly, a literature search was conducted examining published works from January 1996 to December 2004, including OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing \& Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), The Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment/Centre for Review and Dissemination.

OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Improvement or resolution of diabetesThe quality of the studies was examined according to the GRADE Working Group criteria for grading quality of evidence.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: There is evidence that bariatric surgery is effective for improvement and resolution of diabetes in patients who are morbidly obese (BMI≥35 kg/m(2)). The quality of evidence for the use of bariatric surgery for the resolution or improvement of diabetes in morbidly obese people, according to the GRADE quality-of-evidence criteria, was found to be moderate (see ES Table 1). Comparison of various bariatric techniques: No prospective, long-term direct comparison is available between malabsorptive and restrictive techniques.Retrospective subgroup analyses from a large observational study showed greater improvement and resolution of diabetes using malabsorptive techniques rather than purely restrictive methods.There is evidence from a meta-analysis that malabsorptive techniques are better than other banding techniques in terms of improvement and resolution of diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this report is to determine the efficacy of specialized multidisciplinary community care for the management of type 2 diabetes compared to usual care.
CLINICAL NEED: TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION Diabetes (i.e. diabetes mellitus) is a highly prevalent chronic metabolic disorder that interferes with the body's ability to produce or effectively use insulin. The majority (90\%) of diabetes patients have type 2 diabetes. (1) Based on the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), intensive blood glucose and blood pressure control significantly reduce the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetics. While many studies have documented that patients often do not meet the glycemic control targets specified by national and international guidelines, factors associated with glycemic control are less well studied, one of which is the provider(s) of care. Multidisciplinary approaches to care may be particularly important for diabetes management. According guidelines from the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA), the diabetes health care team should be multi-and interdisciplinary. Presently in Ontario, the core diabetes health care team consists of at least a family physician and/or diabetes specialist, and diabetes educators (registered nurse and registered dietician). Increasing the role played by allied health care professionals in diabetes care and their collaboration with physicians may represent a more cost-effective option for diabetes management. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have examined multidisciplinary care programs, but these have either been limited to a specific component of multidisciplinary care (e.g. intensified education programs), or were conducted as part of a broader disease management program, of which not all were multidisciplinary in nature. Most reviews also do not clearly define the intervention(s) of interest, making the evaluation of such multidisciplinary community programs challenging.
EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS METHODS: RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the evidence of efficacy of specialized multidisciplinary community care provided by at least a registered nurse, registered dietician and physician (primary care and/or specialist) for the management of type 2 diabetes compared to usual care? [Henceforth referred to as Model 1]What is the evidence of efficacy of specialized multidisciplinary community care provided by at least a pharmacist and a primary care physician for the management of type 2 diabetes compared to usual care? [Henceforth referred to as Model 2]
INCLUSION CRITERIA: English language full-reportsPublished between January 1, 2000 and September 28, 2008Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analysesType 2 diabetic adult population (≥18 years of age)Total sample size ≥30Describe specialized multidisciplinary community care defined as ambulatory-based care provided by at least two health care disciplines (of which at least one must be a specialist in diabetes) with integrated communication between the care providers.Compared to usual care (defined as health care provision by non-specialist(s) in diabetes, such as primary care providers; may include referral to other health care professionals/services as necessary)≥6 months follow-up
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies where discrete results on diabetes cannot be abstractedPredominantly home-based interventionsInpatient-based interventions
OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: The primary outcomes for this review were glycosylated hemoglobin (rHbA1c) levels and systolic blood pressure (SBP).
SEARCH STRATEGY: A literature search was performed on September 28, 2008 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing \& Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published between January 1, 2000 and September 28, 2008. Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and, for those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist, then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. The quality of evidence was assessed as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology. Given the high clinical heterogeneity of the articles that met the inclusion criteria, specific models of specialized multidisciplinary community care were examined based on models of care that are currently being supported in Ontario, models of care that were commonly reported in the literature, as well as suggestions from an Expert Advisory Panel Meeting held on January 21, 2009.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The initial search yielded 2,116 unique citations, from which 22 RCTs trials and nine systematic reviews published were identified as meeting the eligibility criteria. Of these, five studies focused on care provided by at least a nurse, dietician, and physician (primary care and/or specialist) model of care (Model 1; see Table ES 1), while three studies focused on care provided by at least a pharmacist and primary care physician (Model 2; see Table ES 2). Based on moderate quality evidence, specialized multidisciplinary community care Model 2 has demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant reduction in HbA1c of 1.0\% compared with usual care. The effects of this model on SBP, however, are uncertain compared with usual care, based on very-low quality evidence. Specialized multidisciplinary community care Model 2 has demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant reduction in both HbA1c of 1.05\% (based on high quality evidence) and SBP of 7.13 mm Hg (based on moderate quality evidence) compared to usual care. For both models, the evidence does not suggest a preferred setting of care delivery (i.e., primary care vs. hospital outpatient clinic vs. community clinic).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Among injured patients transferred from one emergency department (ED) to another, we determined factors associated with being discharged from the second ED without procedures, or admission or observation.
METHODS: We analyzed all patients with injury diagnosis codes transferred between two EDs in the 2011 Healthcare Utilization Project State Emergency Department and State Inpatient Databases for 6 states. Multivariable hierarchical logistic regression evaluated the association between patient (demographics and clinical characteristics) and hospital factors, and discharge from the second ED without coded procedures.
RESULTS: In 2011, there were a total of 48,160 ED-to-ED injury transfers, half of which (49\%) were transferred to non-trauma centers, including 23\% with major trauma. A total of 22,011 transfers went to a higher level of care, of which 36\% were discharged from the ED without procedures. Relative to torso injuries, discharge without procedures was more likely for patients with soft tissue (OR 6.8, 95\%CI 5.6-8.2), head (OR 3.7, 95\%CI 3.1-4.6), facial (OR 3.8, 95\%CI 3.1-4.7), or hand (OR 3.1, 95\%CI 2.6-3.8) injuries. Other factors included Medicaid (OR 1.3, 95\%CI 1.2-1.5) or uninsured (OR 1.3, 95\%CI 1.2-1.5) status. Treatment at the receiving ED added an additional \$2859 on average (95\% CI \$2750-\$2968) per discharged patient to the total charges for injury care, not including the costs of ambulance transport between facilities.
CONCLUSION: Over a third of patients transferred to another ED for traumatic injury are discharged from the second ED without admission, observation, or procedures. Telemedicine consultation with sub-specialists might reduce some of these transfers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Equality in healthcare between urban and rural areas is problematic in France. Telemedicine networks are expected to improve equality in expertise assessment. We aimed to evaluate the use and impact of a regional rural French telemedicine network, dedicated to medical and surgical neurological emergencies, on interhospital patient transfers.
METHODS: Eight community hospital emergency departments were remotely connected to the only university hospital in Franche-Comté, France. We prospectively obtained data from all patients consecutively admitted to emergency care departments in the region and who received medical or neurosurgical expertise by telemedicine from January 2002 to December 2015. The reasons for requesting expertise, number of requested neurological opinions, and interhospital patient transfers were analyzed. Economic savings were determined by estimating the cost of avoided transfers.
RESULTS: A total of 23,710 patients had telemedicine consultations in the region. The network was used by every community hospital (independently of the existence of local neurological teams). These consultations were overwhelmingly for cases of stroke (30\%) and head or spinal injuries (36\%). Cerebral tumors represented 9\% of teleconsultations. In 2015, 75\% of patients admitted to the remote hospitals that did not have onsite neurological expertise nevertheless received neurovascular tele-expertise. The rate of thrombolyzed patients dramatically increased within 13 years regionally (9.9\%) and 33.5\% of thrombolyses were performed by telemedicine. The number of patients examined by telemedicine and admitted for head or spinal injuries also increased over the 13-year period (12\% vs. 21\%). Secondary interhospital transfers were halved for both pathologies. The estimated saving is ∼€3.5 million.
CONCLUSION: Telemedicine networks facilitate acute-phase neurological assessment and prevent unnecessary secondary interhospital transfers.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Barriers to executing large-scale randomized controlled trials include costs, complexity, and regulatory requirements. We hypothesized that source document verification (SDV) via remote electronic monitoring is feasible.
METHODS: Five hospitals from two NIH sponsored networks provided remote electronic access to study monitors. We evaluated pre-visit remote SDV compared to traditional on-site SDV using a randomized convenience sample of all study subjects due for a monitoring visit. The number of data values verified and the time to perform remote and on-site SDV was collected.
RESULTS: Thirty-two study subjects were randomized to either remote SDV (N=16) or traditional on-site SDV (N=16). Technical capabilities, remote access policies and regulatory requirements varied widely across sites. In the adult network, only 14 of 2965 data values (0.47\%) could not be located remotely. In the traditional on-site SDV arm, 3 of 2608 data values (0.12\%) required coordinator help. In the pediatric network, all 198 data values in the remote SDV arm and all 183 data values in the on-site SDV arm were located. Although not statistically significant there was a consistent trend for more time consumed per data value (minutes +/- SD): Adult 0.50 +/- 0.17 min vs. 0.39 +/- 0.10 min (two-tailed t-test p=0.11); Pediatric 0.99 +/- 1.07 min vs. 0.56 +/- 0.61 min (p=0.37) and time per case report form: Adult: 4.60 +/- 1.42 min vs. 3.60 +/- 0.96 min (p=0.10); Pediatric: 11.64 +/- 7.54 min vs. 6.07 +/- 3.18 min (p=0.10) using remote SDV.
CONCLUSIONS: Because each site had different policies, requirements, and technologies, a common approach to assimilating monitors into the access management system could not be implemented. Despite substantial technology differences, more than 99\% of data values were successfully monitored remotely. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of remote monitoring and the need to develop consistent access policies for remote study monitoring.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Since 2005, the Western Australian paediatric burn unit has provided a state-wide clinical consultancy and support service for the assessment and management of acute and rehabilitative burn patients via its telehealth service. Since then, the use of this telehealth service has steadily increased as it has become imbedded in the model of care for paediatric burn patients. Primarily, the service involves acute and long term patient reviews conducted by the metropolitan-located burn unit in contact with health practitioners, advising patients and their families who reside outside the metropolitan area thereby avoiding unnecessary transfers and inpatient bed days. A further benefit of the paediatric burn service using telehealth is more efficient use of tertiary level burn unit beds, with only those patients meeting clinical criteria for admission being transferred.
AIM: To conduct a retrospective audit of avoided transfers and bed days in 2005/06-2012/13 as a result of the use of the paediatric Burns Telehealth Service and estimate their cost savings in 2012/13.
METHOD: A retrospective chart audit identified activity, avoided unnecessary acute and scar review patient transfers, inpatient bed days and their associated avoided costs to the tertiary burn unit and patient travel funding.
RESULTS: Over the period 2005/06-2012/13 the audit identified 4,905 avoided inpatient bed days, 364 avoided acute patient transfers and 1,763 avoided follow up review transfers for a total of 1,312 paediatric burn patients as a result of this telehealth service. This paper presents the derivation of these outcomes and an estimation of their cost savings in 2012/13 of AUD 1.89million.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates avoided patient transfers, inpatient bed days and associated costs as the result of an integrated burns telehealth service.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Three years ago the Australian Government undertook to incentivise the adoption of telehealth videoconferencing in primary care. The incentives targeted specialist consultations with patients through their general practitioner (GP), nurse, Aboriginal health worker, and aged care facility. Rural and remote patients and their GPs have benefited from improved access to specialist care in an environment where one kangaroo through your radiator can make a compelling case for remote care delivery.
OBJECTIVE: To discuss some of the practical issues, challenges and opportunities related to running a GP telehealth videoconferencing ser-vice, and describe how we deliver telehealth videoconferencing in our practice.
DISCUSSION: The business case has taken a back seat to the intangible savings in travel costs, lost productivity, and capacity building of local health professionals. Intuitively, delivering medical care by telehealth videoconferencing should just be an extension of day-to-day clinical practice, and an enabler of local team care and attractive to rural people. However, there remains much to be done in quantifying the scope and applicability of remote care in this context, and opportunities to deliver quality care to rural and isolated people are yet to be realised fully.},

Using collection records from a major UK charity, this paper considers what vehicle routing and scheduling benefits could accrue if bank and shop servicing requirements were monitored, the former using remote sensing technology to allow more proactive collection scheduling. A vehicle routing and scheduling algorithm employing tabu search methods was developed, and suggested time and distance savings of up to 30\% over the current fixed schedules when a minimum bank and shop fill level of between 50\% and 60\% was used as a collection trigger. For the case study investigated, this led to a potential revenue gain of 5\% for the charity and estimated CO2 savings of around 0.5 tonnes per week across the fleet of six heterogeneous vehicles.},

	abstract = {Hypertension is a prevalent chronic disease that requires ongoing management and self-care. The disease affects 31\% of American adults and contributed to or caused the deaths of 348,000 Americans in 2008, fewer than 50\% of whom effectively self-managed the disease. However, self-management is complex, with patients requiring ongoing support and easy access to care. Telehealth may help foster the knowledge and skills necessary for those with hypertension to engage in successful self-management. This paper considers the applicability, efficacy, associated risks, and cost-effectiveness of telehealth for individuals and populations with hypertension. Telehealth is a broad term, encompassing telemedicine and mobile health that is used for physician-patient interactions, diagnostics, care delivery, education, information sharing, monitoring, and reminders. Telemedicine may have considerable utility for people diagnosed with hypertension who have poor access or social barriers that constrain access, but potential risks exist. Telehealth technology is evolving rapidly, even in the absence of fully proven cost-effectiveness and efficacy. Considering the cost of inpatient and emergency department care for patients with hypertension, telehealth is a highly attractive alternative, but there are risks to consider. Incorporating telehealth, which is increasingly characterized by mobile health, can increase both the capacity of health care providers and the reach of patient support, clinical management, and self-care. Telehealth studies need improvement; long-term outcome data on cardiovascular events must be obtained, and robust risk analyses and economic studies are needed to prospectively evaluate the safety and cost savings for hypertension self-management.},

The focus of the analysis was planned and unplanned clinical and therapy visits by CMC over a 30-month data collection period. Nonparametric tests were used to compare visit counts among and within the three groups.
RESULTS: The number of unplanned visits decreased over time across all groups, with the greatest decrease in the video telehealth intervention group. Planned visits were higher in the video telehealth group across all time periods.
DISCUSSION: Advanced practice registered nurse-delivered telehealth care coordination may support a shift from unplanned to planned health care service use among CMC.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if an intervention consisting of telemonitoring and supervision by usual primary care clinicians of home self measured blood pressure and optional patient decision support leads to clinically important reductions in daytime systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled blood pressure.
DESIGN: Multicentre randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: 20 primary care practices in south east Scotland.
PARTICIPANTS: 401 people aged 29-95 years with uncontrolled blood pressure (mean daytime ambulatory measurement ≥ 135/85 mm Hg but ≤ 210/135 mm Hg).
INTERVENTION: Self measurement and transmission of blood pressure readings to a secure website for review by the attending nurse or doctor and participant, with optional automated patient decision support by text or email for six months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blinded assessment of mean daytime systolic ambulatory blood pressure six months after randomisation.
RESULTS: 200 participants were randomised to the intervention and 201 to usual care; primary outcome data were available for 90\% of participants (182 and 177, respectively). The mean difference in daytime systolic ambulatory blood pressure adjusted for baseline and minimisation factors between intervention and usual care was 4.3 mm Hg (95\% confidence interval 2.0 to 6.5; P=0.0002) and for daytime diastolic ambulatory blood pressure was 2.3 mm Hg (0.9 to 3.6; P=0.001), with higher values in the usual care group. The intervention was associated with a mean increase of one general practitioner (95\% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.6; P=0.0002) and 0.6 (0.1 to 1.0; P=0.01) practice nurse consultations during the course of the study.
CONCLUSIONS: Supported self monitoring by telemonitoring is an effective method for achieving clinically important reductions in blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension in primary care settings. However, it was associated with increase in use of National Health Service resources. Further research is required to determine if the reduction in blood pressure is maintained in the longer term and if the intervention is cost effective.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To date, the research on relocation has been conducted in countries such as Australia where there are vast distances that need to be travelled by regional, rural and remote patients to access specialist metropolitan treatment. This research considers the issue of relocation for specialist treatment in a New Zealand context.
METHODS: The exploration of the experience of relocation from the consumers' perspective was conducted through an iterative, qualitative research methodology using open-ended interviews conducted by speaker-phone at the time and location of each participant's choice.
RESULTS: The three factors that underpin the phenomenon of 'travel-based' accommodation in New Zealand are the strong desire to return home, the small geographical distances that make this possible for many and the strong determination to endure hardship associated with travel when distances are long.
CONCLUSIONS: Any understanding of relocation for specialist treatment needs to be informed by two concepts: 'travel-based' relocation and 'accommodation-based' relocation.                                               RELEVANCE OF MANUSCRIPT TO INFORM RESEARCH, POLICIES AND/OR PROGRAMS:                          The focus needs to be on providing supportive travel arrangements where possible. In New Zealand, as elsewhere, cancer supportive care organisations are increasingly providing volunteers to assist with travel. Such practical volunteer assistance is important, as is financial support through government subsidies to cover the cost of such travel. The insights from the study affirm the importance of health professionals who are supportive and creative in their efforts to assist people to return home. Supportive clinical care such as addressing issues in relation to nausea and pain management for those travelling must also be considered.},

DESIGN AND SETTING: This paper uses descriptive qualitative research based on 45 interviews with patients with haematology in Queensland. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded and thematically analysed.
RESULTS: In addition to issues of distance, farmers and rural property owners who have to relocate for specialist care must deal with problems associated with the lack of opportunity to take absence from the property because of the inescapable pressure of daily farm and property responsibilities and the high cost of, or lack of opportunity to, outsource daily maintenance. Further concerns include the cost of relocation in the context of continuing drought, serious problems sustaining the travel and time away required, and the lack of choice for some but to deal with treatment alone.
CONCLUSION: In recent years there has been considerable progress with regard to overcoming the distance barrier for rural and remote patients with cancer through innovative clinical models using technology and telemedicine. However, there has been limited uptake of such models for patients with haematology. The present findings indicate that from the perspective of rural farmers and property owners there are important reasons why the use of innovative strategies should be fostered and expanded.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Virtual visits are clinical interactions in health care that do not involve the patient and provider being in the same room at the same time. The use of virtual visits is growing rapidly in health care. Some health systems are integrating virtual visits into primary care as a complement to existing modes of care, in part reflecting a growing focus on patient-centered care. There is, however, limited empirical evidence about how patients view this new form of care and how it affects overall health system use.
OBJECTIVE: Descriptive objectives were to assess users and providers of virtual visits, including the reasons patients give for use. The analytic objective was to assess empirically the influence of virtual visits on overall primary care use and costs, including whether virtual care is with a known or a new primary care physician.
METHODS: The study took place in British Columbia, Canada, where virtual visits have been publicly funded since October 2012. A survey of patients who used virtual visits and an observational study of users and nonusers of virtual visits were conducted. Comparison groups included two groups: (1) all other BC residents, and (2) a group matched (3:1) to the cohort. The first virtual visit was used as the intervention and the main outcome measures were total primary care visits and costs.
RESULTS: During 2013-2014, there were 7286 virtual visit encounters, involving 5441 patients and 144 physicians. Younger patients and physicians were more likely to use and provide virtual visits (P{\textless}.001), with no differences by sex. Older and sicker patients were more likely to see a known provider, whereas the lowest socioeconomic groups were the least likely (P{\textless}.001). The survey of 399 virtual visit patients indicated that virtual visits were liked by patients, with 372 (93.2\%) of respondents saying their virtual visit was of high quality and 364 (91.2\%) reporting their virtual visit was "very" or "somewhat" helpful to resolve their health issue. Segmented regression analysis and the corresponding regression parameter estimates suggested virtual visits appear to have the potential to decrease primary care costs by approximately Can \$4 per quarter (Can -\$3.79, P=.12), but that benefit is most associated with seeing a known provider (Can -\$8.68, P{\textless}.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Virtual visits may be one means of making the health system more patient-centered, but careful attention needs to be paid to how these services are integrated into existing health care delivery systems.},

We describe a retrospective review of the first 12 months of Waikato Teledermatology (WT), a low-cost, secure, website-based, store-and-forward teledermatology network using the Collegium Telemedicus platform.
METHODS: We determined specialist response time, referral metrics, patient diagnosis and progress reports from the network's database. The programme's value was evaluated by post-pilot online surveys of referrers and specialist dermatologists.
RESULTS: WT was used by 31 referring doctors for 309 consultations with four dermatologists between July 2013 and June 2014. Mean and median specialist response time was 2.07 hours (range: 0.13-5.64 hours). The researchers categorized the referrals as tumours (56.8\%) and rashes (43.2\%), including inflammatory dermatoses (51.9\%), infection (18.1\%), uncertain (16.5\%), miscellaneous (7.5\%), and of environmental origin (6\%). Thirty tumours were biopsied, including nine melanomas and three basal cell carcinomas. A total of 158 progress reports and 35 survey responses were received. Reported advantages included decreased delay, improved accuracy of diagnosis and treatment compared to that made without specialist input, decreased unnecessary procedures such as biopsies of undiagnosed conditions, and increased appropriate referrals for face-to-face assessment, thus leading to cost savings for the patient and the health care system. The major disadvantages were the time burden for clinicians to complete consultations, the lack of integration with the patients' usual electronic medical record and absence of funding.
DISCUSSION: WT proved an effective and acceptable approach to improving patient access to dermatologic services.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mobile phone based remote monitoring of medication adherence and physiological parameters has the potential of improving long-term graft outcomes in the recipients of kidney transplants. This technology is promising as it is relatively inexpensive, can include intuitive software and may offer the ability to conduct close patient monitoring in a non-intrusive manner. This includes the optimal management of comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. There is, however, a lack of data assessing the attitudes of renal transplant recipients toward this technology, especially among ethnic minorities.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the attitudes of renal transplant recipients toward mobile phone based remote monitoring and management of their medical regimen; and to identify demographic or clinical characteristics that impact on this attitude.
METHODS: After a 10 minute demonstration of a prototype mobile phone based monitoring system, a 10 item questionnaire regarding attitude toward remote monitoring and the technology was administered to the participants, along with the 10 item Perceived Stress Scale and the 7 item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale.
RESULTS: Between February and April 2012, a total of 99 renal transplant recipients were identified and agreed to participate in the survey. The results of the survey indicate that while 90\% (87/97) of respondents own a mobile phone, only 7\% (7/98) had any prior knowledge of mobile phone based remote monitoring. Despite this, the majority of respondents, 79\% (78/99), reported a positive attitude toward the use of a prototype system if it came at no cost to themselves. Blacks were more likely than whites to own smartphones (43.1\%, 28/65 vs 20.6\%, 7/34; P=.03) and held a more positive attitude toward free use of the prototype system than whites (4.25±0.88 vs 3.76±1.07; P=.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrates that kidney transplant recipients have a positive overall attitude toward mobile phone based health technology (mHealth). Additionally, the data demonstrates that most kidney transplant recipients own and are comfortable using mobile phones and that many of these patients already own and use smart mobile phones. The respondents felt that mHealth offers an opportunity for improved self-efficacy and improved provider driven medical management. Respondents were comfortable with the idea of being monitored using mobile technology and are confident that their privacy can be protected. The small subset of kidney transplant recipients who are less interested in mHealth may be less technologically adept as reflected by their lower mobile phone ownership rates. As a whole, kidney transplant recipients are receptive to the technology and believe in its utility.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unintended rehospitalizations after surgical procedures represent a large percentage of readmissions and have been associated with increased morbidity and cost of care. Beginning in 2017, Medicare will expand diagnostic categories subject to financial penalties for excess postoperative readmissions to include coronary revascularization procedures. Arrhythmias and pulmonary complications comprise the largest categories for readmission after cardiac surgery. Technologic advances in remote monitoring have led to the use of web-based digital health kits (DHK) aimed at reducing readmissions and improving postoperative outcomes. The present study was performed to determine the added benefit of incorporating DHK's into a formal readmissions reduction program (RRP) in preventing 30-d readmissions and to evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the use of these devices.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study of all adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution from March 2014 to June 2015. During the study period, 443 adult patients (mean age, 65 ± 14, 33\% female) were identified and participated in the formal RRP, 27 of whom also received a DHK after discharge (416 control group). In addition to providing a live video link to a provider specializing in cardiac surgery, the DHK also allowed for automatic daily transmission of weight, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure. Patients also completed a daily health survey targeting symptoms concerning for heart failure, poor wound healing, poor ambulation, and nonadherence to medications. Abnormal vitals or survey responses triggered automatic notifications to the healthcare team. Satisfaction surveys were administered to participants and members of the healthcare team. Pearson χ(2) test and the Welch's t-test were used to assess statistical differences in baseline characteristics and outcome variables.
RESULTS: During the study period, the readmission rate for the DHK and control groups were similar (7.4\% versus 9.9\%, P = 0.65). The use of DHKs led to 1649 alerts and 144 interventions, with the highest number of alerts occurring during d 5-9. The majority of alerts (64\%) were prompted by abnormal biometric measurements, and a significant correlation was noted between abnormal biometrics and required intervention (r = 0.62, P {\textless} 0.001). No correlation was seen between alerts because of health survey responses (r = 0.07, P = 0.71) or missed check-ins (r = 0.06, P = 0.76) and required interventions. Poststudy satisfaction surveys showed an overall satisfaction rating of 4.9 ± 0.5 for DHK patients and 4.9 ± 0.2 for members of the care team (scale 1-5, 5 = agree).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, adding DHKs to a formal RRP was not associated with a significant decrease in 30-d readmission rates. We also found that notifications because of abnormal biometric measures were significantly correlated with required interventions. In contrast, notifications due to abnormal health survey responses were not associated with increased interventions. Both patients and members of the healthcare team were highly satisfied with this technology. DHKs appear to extend care beyond the inpatient period and provide a portal for telemonitoring of surgical patients. However, this modality is highly resource intensive and may not significantly reduce readmissions. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of such kits in reducing readmissions and costs of care.},

A total of 110 patients with moderate to severe COPD were recruited from a specialist respiratory service in Northern Ireland. Patients had at least two of: emergency department admissions, hospital admissions or emergency general practitioner (GP) contacts in the 12 months before the study. Exclusion criteria were patients who had any respiratory disorder other than COPD, or were cognitively unable to learn the process of monitoring. Patients were randomised to receive six months of home telemonitoring with usual care, or six months of usual care. The primary outcome measure was disease-specific quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C). Of 100 patients completing the study, 48 patients were randomised to telemonitoring and 52 patients were randomised to the control group. The SGRQ-C scores improved significantly in the intervention group compared to usual care (P = 0.001). The HADS anxiety score was significantly higher in the telehealth group compared to the usual care group (P = 0.01). There were significantly more contacts with the Community Respiratory Team in the telemonitoring group compared to the control group (P = 0.029). There were no significant between group differences in EQ-5D scores, HADS depression scores, GP activity, emergency department visits, hospital admissions or exacerbations. The total cost to the health service of the intervention over the 6-month study period was £2039, giving an estimated ICER of £203,900. In selected patients with COPD, telemonitoring was effective in improving health-related quality of life and anxiety, but was not a cost-effective intervention.},

METHODS: A structured questionnaire was developed and sent to all consultant paediatricians working in a district general hospital in Northern Ireland.
RESULTS: Paediatricians (n = 35) regarded the regional paediatric telecardiology service as very useful and of good value for money. Paediatricans in hospitals without access to telecardiology expressed a desire to join the network (86\%, 12/14). More frequent use of the paediatric telecardiology service was associated with increased confidence in performing echocardiography and using the telemedicine equipment and a special interest in neonatology. The vast majority of paediatricians (32/35, 91\%) believed that there should be a shared clinical responsibility for the patient following a teleconsultation. A total of 33/35 (94\%) stated that the telephone costs of the consultation should be paid by the paediatrician but that the professional time of the cardiologist should be paid by the tertiary centre (29/35, 83\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Paediatricians have consistently positive experiences of a regional paediatric telecardiology service. They believe that clinical responsibility is shared, and there should not be any professional fee for telemedicine activities.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the sustainability, clinical utility and acceptability to clinicians and parents of a tele-homecare programme for infants with major congenital heart disease (CHD), and to evaluate the impact on healthcare resource use.
DESIGN: Randomised control trial.
SETTING: UK tertiary congenital cardiac centre.
PARTICIPANTS: 83 infants with major CHD.
INTERVENTION: Participants were randomised to one of three groups: video-conferencing support (n=35), telephone support (n=24) and a control group (n=24). Patients in the two intervention groups received regular, standardised remote consultations. Video-conferences (VCs) were facilitated by Integrated Systems Digital Network lines and replaced by home broadband connections later in the study.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healthcare resource use, utilisation including hospitalisation, clinicians' opinions on utility and quality of interventions, parental opinions on quality of interventions.
RESULTS: Clinicians were more confident making medical decisions following VCs compared with telephone consultations (p=0.01). Both VC and telephone support were very well received, but parents expressed significantly higher levels of satisfaction with VC support (p=0.001). Healthcare resource use was 37\% lower in the video-conferencing group compared with both telephone support and control groups (p{\textless}0.001), as was the risk of hospitalisation (p=0.006). Direct health service costs were significantly lower in the video-conferencing group (p{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: A tele-medicine home support programme for families of infants with major CHD is feasible, sustainable and effective. Home support with video-conferencing is superior to telephone consultations. Parents are highly satisfied with tele-homecare. Tele-homecare significantly reduces health service utilisation and may reduce health service costs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Health-e-Access, a telemedicine service providing care for acute illnesses in children, has delivered {\textgreater}6500 telemedicine visits from 10 primary care practices in Rochester, New York, by using telemedicine access at 22 child care and school sites. The goal was to assess the hypotheses that children served by Health-e-Access received health care more often for acute illnesses but had fewer emergency department (ED) visits and lower health care expenditures than did children without access through this service.
METHODS: By using insurance claims, this case study compared utilization (starting in May 2001) of telemedicine, office, or ED care for children with versus without telemedicine access. Children included in analyses had {\textgreater} or =6 consecutive insurance-covered months through July 2007. Claims data captured all utilization. A total of 19 652 child-months from 1216 children with telemedicine access were matched with respect to age, gender, socioeconomic status, and season with child-months for children without telemedicine availability.
RESULTS: The mean age at utilization was 6.71 years, with 79\% of all child-months being covered by Medicaid managed care. The overall utilization rate was 305.1 visits per 100 child-years. In multivariate analyses with adjustment for potential confounders, overall illness-related utilization rates (in-person or telemedicine visits per 100 child-years) for all sites were 23.5\% greater for children with telemedicine access than for control children, but ED utilization was 22.2\% less.
CONCLUSION: The Health-e-Access telemedicine model holds potential to reduce health care costs, mostly through replacement of ED visits for nonemergency problems.},

Despite the public health relevance and implications of studying smoking in adolescents, little is known about the initiation of quit attempts, the process of relapse, and the most efficacious treatment interventions in this high-risk and underserved population. Issues such as retention in research studies and accuracy of self-reports have prompted investigators to explore innovative technology-based systems to integrate into treatment studies and services delivery.
METHODS: This paper will review the remote monitoring of smoking through means of ecological momentary assessment, biochemical verification of smoking verified through video capture, physiological monitoring, and mobile-delivered interventions using self-reported smoking outcomes in adolescents, when applicable.
RESULTS: Use of remote monitoring methods in adolescent smokers has been limited thus far, though monitoring technology in adults has shown promise for understanding relapse and delivering treatment interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive technology-based systems that do not rely primarily on self-report to monitor smoking would be a highly fruitful and innovative avenue to explore with adolescent smokers. Technology integration holds great promise to improve health-related research, treatment delivery, cost-effectiveness, and just-in-time interventions, but its novelty comes with unique problems and concerns to be carefully considered.},

To address these problems, we propose to use Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) as a technology to achieve energy efficient, reliable, and low-cost remote monitoring of transmission grids. With WSNs, smart grid enables both utilities and customers to monitor, predict and manage energy usage effectively and react to possible power grid disturbances in a timely manner. However, the increased application of WSNs also introduces new security challenges, especially related to privacy, connectivity, and security management, repeatedly causing unpredicted expenditures. Monitoring the status of the power system, a large amount of sensors generates massive amount of sensitive data. In order to build an effective Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for a smart grid, we focus on designing a methodology of efficient and secure delivery of the data measured on transmission lines. We perform a set of simulations, in which we examine different routing algorithms, security mechanisms and WSN deployments in order to select the parameters that will not affect the delivery time but fulfill their role and ensure security at the same time. Furthermore, we analyze the optimal placement of direct wireless links, aiming at minimizing time delays, balancing network performance and decreasing deployment costs.},

This need for veterinarians trained in global health is reflected by the demand among students for greater exposure and education. At the same time, many students are held back from on-site training in global health due to constraints of cost, time, or family obligations. The purpose of this article is to describe the use of a telemedicine approach to educating veterinary students at Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. This approach simultaneously provides expert consultation and support for a pro bono hospital in the developing world. The development of a telemedicine teaching service is discussed, from initial ad hoc email consultation among friends and associates to a more formal use of store-and-forward delivery of data along with real-time videoconferencing on a regular basis, termed tele-rounds. The practicalities of data delivery and exchange and best use of available bandwidth are also discussed, as this very mundane information is critical to efficient and useful tele-rounds. Students are able to participate in discussion of cases that they would never see in their usual clinical sphere and to become familiar with diagnostic and treatment approaches to these cases. By having the patient "virtually" brought to us, tele-rounds also decrease the usual carbon footprint of global health delivery.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telecare could greatly facilitate chronic disease management in the community, but despite government promotion and positive demonstrations its implementation has been limited. This study aimed to identify factors inhibiting the implementation and integration of telecare systems for chronic disease management in the community.
METHODS: Large scale comparative study employing qualitative data collection techniques: semi-structured interviews with key informants, task-groups, and workshops; framework analysis of qualitative data informed by Normalization Process Theory. Drawn from telecare services in community and domestic settings in England and Scotland, 221 participants were included, consisting of health professionals and managers; patients and carers; social care professionals and managers; and service suppliers and manufacturers.
RESULTS: Key barriers to telecare integration were uncertainties about coherent and sustainable service and business models; lack of coordination across social and primary care boundaries, lack of financial or other incentives to include telecare within primary care services; a lack of a sense of continuity with previous service provision and self-care work undertaken by patients; and general uncertainty about the adequacy of telecare systems. These problems led to poor integration of policy and practice.
CONCLUSION: Telecare services may offer a cost effective and safe form of care for some people living with chronic illness. Slow and uneven implementation and integration do not stem from problems of adoption. They result from incomplete understanding of the role of telecare systems and subsequent adaption and embeddedness to context, and uncertainties about the best way to develop, coordinate, and sustain services that assist with chronic disease management. Interventions are therefore needed that (i) reduce uncertainty about the ownership of implementation processes and that lock together health and social care agencies; and (ii) ensure user centred rather than biomedical/service-centred models of care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore how barriers to accessing fertility services affect the treatment decisions made by fertility patients and service providers in Newfoundland and Labrador.
METHODS: Semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 patients across Newfoundland and with eight service providers from Newfoundland and Labrador Fertility Services (located in St. John's) to gather the perspectives of both patients and providers. The interview transcripts were analyzed thematically.
RESULTS: Patients' responses to fertility service access barriers included choosing cheaper drugs, substituting intrauterine insemination (IUI) for IVF or not using IVF, delaying IVF, choosing more accessible IVF clinics, transferring multiple embryos, and stopping treatment altogether. Some patients, however, noted that the barriers would not stop them from continuing with treatment. Providers' responses to the barriers patients faced included changing drug protocols, manipulating ovulation, providing teleconsultations, and minimizing patients' clinic visits for those living some distance away from St. John's.
CONCLUSION: Both patients and providers make treatment-related decisions to maximize the likelihood of a successful pregnancy and to reduce costs, which can result in less effective care and at times increased risk to the patient. Unlike with other types of care, responses to barriers to fertility treatment largely result in changes to individual patient treatment plans rather than changing models of care. As a result, many patients must continue to seek fertility services in large urban centres and incur substantial personal costs.},

D-Heart® is a portable device that enables the acquisition of the ECG on multiple leads which streams via Bluetooth to any smartphone. Because of the potential impact of this technology in low-income settings, we determined the accuracy of D-Heart® tracings in the stratification of ECG morphological abnormalities, compared with 12-lead ECGs.
METHODS: Consecutive African patients referred to the Ziguinchor Regional Hospital (Senegal) were enrolled (n=117; 69 males, age 39±11years). D-Heart® recordings (3 peripheral leads plus V5) were obtained immediately followed by 12 lead ECGs and were assessed blindly by 2 independent observers. Global burden of ECG abnormalities was defined by a semi-quantitative score based on the sum of 9 criteria, identifying four classes of increasing severity.
RESULTS: D-Heart® and 12-lead ECG tracings were respectively classified as: normal: 72 (61\%) vs 69 (59\%); mildly abnormal: 42 (36\%) vs 45 (38\%); moderately abnormal: 3 (3\%) vs 3 (3\%). None had markedly abnormal tracings. Cohen's weighted kappa (kw) test demonstrated a concordance of 0,952 (p{\textless}0,001, agreement 98,72\%). Concordance was high as well for the Romhilt-Estes score (kw=0,893; p{\textless}0,001 agreement 97,35\%). PR and QRS intervals comparison with Bland-Altman method showed good accuracy for D-Heart® measurements (95\% limit of agreement ±20ms for PR and ±10ms for QRS).
CONCLUSIONS: D-Heart® proved effective and accurate stratification of ECG abnormalities comparable to the 12-lead electrocardiographs, thereby opening new perspectives for low-cost community cardiovascular screening programs in low-income settings.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two systems for the automated two-way transmission of newborn hearing screening and configuration data, based on mobile communication technology, for the screening devices MADSEN AccuScreen® and Natus Echo-Screen® were developed and tested in a field study. Radio modem connections were compared with conventional analogue modem transmissions from Natus Echo-Screen devices for duration, transmission rate, number of lost connections, and frequency of use.
RESULTS: The average session duration was significantly lower with the MADSEN AccuScreen (12 s) and Natus Echo-Screen both with radio modem (15 s) than the Natus Echo-Screen with analogue modem (108 s). The transmission rate was significantly higher (898 and 1,758 vs. 181 bytes/s) for the devices with radio modems. Both radio modem devices had significantly lower rates of broken connections after initial connection (2.1 and 0.9 vs. 5.5\%). An increase in the frequency of data transmission from the clinics with mobile radio devices was found.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of mobile communication technology in newborn hearing screening devices offers improvements in the average session duration, transmission rate, and reliability of the connection over analogue solutions. We observed a behavioral change in clinical staff using the new technology: the data exchange with the tracking center is more often used. The requirements for on-site support were reduced. These savings outweigh the small increase in costs for the Internet service provider.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemedicine could be very useful for patients in remote areas experiencing adverse drug reactions or being in need of sophisticated diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The aim of this article is to show the experience of our Department of Nuclear Medicine (DNM) in telemonitoring patients with differentiated thyroid carcinomas and neuroendocrine tumors.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The DNM at the Clinical Center Kragujevac, Serbia, uses continuous remote monitoring of patients' vital functions, including heart rate, electrocardiogram, respiration rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, as well as video surveillance of the physical isolation area for patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and some patients with differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTCs), during administration of radionuclide therapy and for the days following treatment.
RESULTS: The DNM used a telemonitoring system for 156 patients with either DTC or NET who received radionuclide therapy during the last 3 years. There were 32 interventions on patients in the physical isolation area based on changes of the patients' vital functions detected by the telemonitoring system. Twenty-five patients (78\%) experienced symptoms, whereas the other seven patients (22\%) were symptomless. A responsible physician intervened with treatment of tachycardia (18 cases), hypertension (10 cases), hypotension (2 cases), ventricular extrasystoles (1 case), and ST-segment depression (1 case). After administration of the treatment the health status of the patients was normalized.
CONCLUSION: From our experience gained over the past 3 years, this model of organization and supervision with a telemonitoring system of patients receiving radionuclide therapy ensures a high level of safety for the patient, with significant reduction of staff costs.},

	volume = {18 Suppl 1},
	issn = {1790-5427},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Following radionuclide therapy, patients usually must remain hospitalised in special "restricted access area" 2-5 days, until radiation in their body drops below a certain level. During this period medical personnel can be faced with some challenges. Based on our previous experience, we used telemedicine approach as solution for it. We have developed comprehensive telemedicine system, which consists of three own developed hardware \& software modules which are accessible remotely.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Challenge \#1 Some of patients can experiencing serious complications related to radionuclide therapy or related to co-morbidities, if they have any of it. In some of those cases audio-visual contact with patients and follow-up their vital functions can be of high importance in case of patient needs urgent intervention. Solution \#1 System for on-line remote monitoring of patients' vital functions registered with bed side monitor and video surveillance of area which use patients during hospitalisation. This system is established by IP cameras and bedside patient monitor, equipped with appropriate network card and software. Using remote connection (LAN or internet), a physician can watch at personal computer or mobile phone the waves and vital signs patterns from the bedside monitor, as well as live video from surveillance cameras. It provides prompt intervention in case of emergency. Challenge \#2 Having in mind the overall costs of radionuclide therapy and patients hospital stay on the one hand, and limited capacity of the hospital premises for radionuclide therapy, on the other, it is of high importance to estimate as early as possible the time period after which the radiation in a patient's body will drop below the limit imposed by the law. Solution \#2 On-line remote radiation monitoring system, which measures the radiation exposure rate by means of a pancake probe, which is connected to a PTZ (Pan-tilt-zoom) device and DVR (Digital video recorder). Those devices enable precise positioning of the detector on target region of the patient's body. The positioning of the detector can be visually controlled by a micro camera, placed at the center of detector's plane. Furthermore, there are three LASER pointers placed around the detector in order to mark the area where it is directed. In addition, two ultrasound sensors placed on the edge of the detector holder in order to estimate the exact distance between the probe and the patient's body. All those devices are controlled by the DVR. The data collected by the detector are acquired and processed by a PC, using customized hardware/software system developed by Italian ThereminoR group. Using remote connection, a physician can watch on-line radiation exposure rate in any time and can use commands of PTZ and DVR device for proper positioning of probe during measurement and control it by micro camera, LASER pointers and US sensors. Physician demands from the patients to take the same position for 5 minutes on each hour, during first 10 hours. Those data we use as reference points for further processing by our software. Based on two exponential matematical model, our software estimates the whole process of elimination of radioactivity from the patient's body, using reference points collected during the first day after radionuclide therapy. Based on that, physician can predict (on first day after therapy!) when patient will be able to leave the restricted access area". Challenge \#3 Despite strict instructions given to them by physician and nurse before administration of radionuclide therapy, some patients sometimes try to leave "restricted access area". Solution \#3 We have developed a system which continuously monitors the corridor which a patient must use in case of an attempt to leave the "restricted access area". Our system consists of a survey meter equipped with pancake probe directed towards the corridor. The survey meter is connected to a trigger circuit which gives signal in the case when the measeured count rate exceeds previously adjusted value. Trigger circuit is connected to the programmable siren, blinking light, alarm device unit with SIM card and IP surveillance camera. On the siren we previously recorded the voice alarm. In the case when the system is triggered, the patient will hear warning message and see blinking light. When the alarm device is triggered it will call responsible physician and nurse on mobile phone and IP camera simultaneously records this event. System also sending via email appropriate data about each event, when it happens.
CONCLUSION: From our experience gained over the past 4 years, our telemonitoring system dedicated for patients receiving radionuclide therapy ensures a high level of safety for the patient and medical staff.},

	issn = {1198-0052},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the perceptions of health care providers concerning patient and health care provider strategies to limit out-of-pocket costs for cancer care.
METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 cancer care providers (nurses, social workers, oncologists, surgeons, pharmacists, and dieticians) in Newfoundland and Labrador.
RESULTS: Patients try to minimize costs by substituting or rationing medications, choosing radical treatments, lengthening the time between follow-up appointments, choosing inpatient care, and working during treatment to minimize loss of income. Providers respond to the financial concerns of patients by helping them to access financial assistance programs, by changing chemotherapy and supportive drug prescriptions, and by shortening radiation treatment protocols. They admit patients to hospital and arrange follow-up with physicians closer to a patient's home.
CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-pocket costs resulting from cancer care are incurred at all phases of treatment and follow-up. These costs are substantial concerns for some patients and their health care providers. Encouraging communication between patients and their providers is needed to identify individuals at risk and to safely modify care plans. Tele-oncology and public drug, medical travel, and leave programs are needed to ensure that patients are better able to afford the costs related to cancer care.},

The research question was: what are the experiences and preferences of COPD patients in relation to discharge from hospital with televideo consultations? The study shows that the patients' assessments of the effectiveness and value of the televideo consultations in their everyday lives are based on tough cost-benefit calculation of the extent to which the intervention makes their lives easier or more difficult. In public settings, the expectations are high that digital mediation between clients' everyday lives and the healthcare system can strengthen patients' abilities regarding their self-management. Nonetheless, the study shows that patients have a number of reservations concerning televideo consultations at home. The patients' assessments of the service must be understood in relation to the routines and strategies developed to handle the array of problems related to a life affected by chronic illness.},

METHODS: Fifty three patients (including 1 acute myocardial infarction) were evaluated for the above parameters using accepted standard methods and the Remote Medical Diagnostics kit.
RESULTS: The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), saturation pulse, manual pulse and temperature was 0.927, 0.904, 0.989, 0.99 and 0.912 indicating a high degree of agreement between the two methods. For oxygen saturation, the ICC was 0.763 indicating a moderately high agreement. For heart sounds, the kappa coefficient (kappa) for inter-rater reliability was 0.48 (observed agreement of 96.1\%). For breath sounds, the 'kappa' value was 0.48 indicating moderate agreement. For the breath sounds, the 'kappa' value was 0.38, indicating fair agreement (the observed agreement of 94.2\%). For the ECG, the observed agreement was 94.4\% by visual assessment.

	abstract = {The health care industry is undergoing a major transformation. Despite spending more on health care than any other country, the United States has not seen a commensurate improvement in the quality of care. Chronic disease management puts the greatest burden on the health care system with estimates suggesting that 3 of 4 health care dollars are spent on managing chronic disease. Moreover, the number of older patients with chronic conditions, like diabetes, is rising as expected, which only serves to worsen the physician shortage problem we are currently experiencing, and further increase health care costs. Unless new models of health care are established for these patients, they simply will not be served. Consistent with the message above, there are generally 3 universal health care needs, (1) improved outcomes, (2) expanded access, and (3) optimized cost and efficiency. It is likely the future state will involve value-based health care, with payment based on outcomes, not services rendered, and incentives tied more directly to the value delivered. Medical device providers will be held more accountable for positive outcomes, and to ensure success, they will need to create better solutions with their therapies. Instead of the touch point with patients being solely at the time of a procedure or sale of the device, it is likely companies will need to drive toward a more comprehensive partnership with patients, providers, and payers, extending the scope of services and interactions to provide a continuum of care. In general, companies will need to start to think of their most important customers as people living with a condition, as opposed to patients needing immediate medical devices. In this article, I discuss the challenges of health care today and present some of the opportunities to revamp health care delivery in diabetes by leveraging the pervasive use of mobile technologies and digital data.},

Our model considers GHG emissions for both vehicle and videoconferencing unit energy use. Cost avoidance factors are also discussed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Travel distances in kilometers were calculated for each appointment using postal code data and Google Maps™ Web-based map calculator tools.
RESULTS: Including return travel, an estimated 757,234 km were avoided, resulting in a GHG emissions savings of 185,159 kg (185 metric tons) of carbon dioxide equivalents in vehicle emissions. Approximately 360,444 g of other air pollutant emissions was also avoided. The GHG emissions produced by energy consumption for videoconference units were estimated to be 42 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents emitted for this sample.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall GHG emissions associated with videoconferencing unit energy is minor when compared with those avoided from vehicle use. In addition to improved patient-centered care and cost savings, environmental benefits provide additional incentives for the adoption of telemedicine services.},

	abstract = {Despite recent advances in multiple sclerosis (MS) care, many patients only infrequently access health care services, or are unable to access them easily, for reasons such as mobility restrictions, travel costs, consultation and treatment time constraints, and a lack of locally available MS expert services. Advances in mobile communications have led to the introduction of electronic health (eHealth) technologies, which are helping to improve both access to and the quality of health care services. As the Internet is now readily accessible through smart mobile devices, most people can take advantage of eHealth apps. The development of digital applications and remote communication technologies for patients with MS has increased rapidly in recent years. These apps are intended to complement traditional in-clinic approaches and can bring significant benefits to both patients with MS and health care providers (HCPs). For patients, such eHealth apps have been shown to improve outcomes and increase access to care, disease information, and support. These apps also help patients to participate actively in self-management, for example, by tracking adherence to treatment, changes in bladder and bowel habits, and activity and mood. For HCPs, MS eHealth solutions can simplify the multidisciplinary approaches needed to tailor MS management strategies to individual patients; facilitate remote monitoring of patient symptoms, adverse events, and outcomes; enable the efficient use of limited resources and clinic time; and potentially allow more timely intervention than is possible with scheduled face-to-face visits. These benefits are important because MS is a long-term, multifaceted chronic condition that requires ongoing monitoring, assessment, and management. We identified in the literature 28 eHealth solutions for patients with MS that fall within the four categories of screening and assessment, disease monitoring and self-management, treatment and rehabilitation, and advice and education. We review each solution, focusing on any clinical evidence supporting their use from prospective trials (including ASSESS MS, Deprexis, MSdialog, and the Multiple Sclerosis Performance Test) and consider the opportunities, barriers to adoption, and potential pitfalls of eHealth technologies in routine health care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improvements in communication and information technologies have allowed for the globalisation of health services, especially the provision of health services from other countries, such as the use of telemedicine. This has led countries to evaluate their position on whether and to what extent they should open their health systems to trade. This often takes place from the context of multi-lateral trade agreements (under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation), which is misplaced as a significant amount of trade takes place regionally or bi-laterally. We report here the results of a qualitative study assessing stakeholders' views on the potential for a bi-lateral trade relationship between India and the UK, where India acts as an exporter and the UK as an importer of telemedicine services.
METHODS: 19 semi-structured interviews were carried out with stakeholders from India and the UK. The themes discussed include prospects on the viability of a bi-lateral relationship between the UK and India on telemedicine, current activities and operations, barriers, benefits and risks.
RESULTS: The participants in general believed there were good prospects for telemedicine trade, and that this could bring benefits to "importing" countries in terms of cost-savings and faster delivery of care and to "exporting" countries in the form of foreign exchange and quality improvement. However, there were some concerns regarding quality of care, regulation, accreditation and data security.
CONCLUSIONS: There is potential for trade in this type of health services to succeed and bring about important benefits to the countries involved. However, issues around data security and accreditation need to be taken into consideration. Countries may wish to consider entering bi-lateral agreements, as they provide more potential to address the concerns and capitalise on the benefits. Finally, this paper concludes that more data should be collected, both on the volume of telemedicine trade and on the impact it is having on health systems, as currently there is very limited data on this.},

The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a primary care-based telemonitoring intervention on the frequency of hospital admissions.
METHODS/DESIGN: A primary care-based randomised controlled trial will be carried out to assess the impact of a telemonitoring intervention aimed at home care patients with heart failure (HF) and/or chronic lung disease (CLD). The results will be compared with those obtained with standard health care practice. The duration of the study will be of one year. Sixty patients will be recruited for the study. In-home patients, diagnosed with HF and/or CLD, aged 14 or above and with two or more hospital admissions in the previous year will be eligible. For the intervention group, telemonitoring will consist of daily patient self-measurements of respiratory-rate, heart-rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, weight and body temperature. Additionally, the patients will complete a qualitative symptom questionnaire daily using the telemonitoring system. Routine telephone contacts will be conducted every fortnight and additional telephone contacts will be carried out if the data received at the primary care centre are out of the established limits. The control group will receive usual care. The primary outcome measure is the number of hospital admissions due to any cause that occurred in a period of 12 months post-randomisation. The secondary outcome measures are: duration of hospital stay, hospital admissions due to HF or CLD, mortality rate, use of health care resources, quality of life, cost-effectiveness, compliance and patient and health care professional satisfaction with the new technology.
DISCUSSION: The results of this study will shed some light on the effects of telemonitoring for the follow-up and management of chronic patients from a primary care setting. The study may contribute to enhance the understanding of alternative modes of health care provision for medically unstable elderly patients, who bear a high degree of physical and functional deterioration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telephone nursing is the first line of contact for many care-seekers and aims at optimizing the performance of the healthcare system by supporting and guiding patients to the correct level of care and reduce the amount of unscheduled visits. Good statistical models that describe the effects of telephone nursing are important in order to study its impact on healthcare resources and evaluate changes in telephone nursing procedures.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a valid model that captures the complex relationships between the nurse's recommendations, the patients' intended actions and the patients' health seeking behavior. Using the model to estimate the effects of telephone nursing on patient behavior, healthcare utilization, and infer potential cost savings.
METHODS: Bayesian ordinal regression modeling of data from randomly selected patients that received telephone nursing. Inference is based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, model selection using the Watanabe-Akaike Information Criteria (WAIC), and model validation using posterior predictive checks on standard discrepancy measures.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We present a robust Bayesian ordinal regression model that predicts three-quarters of the patients' healthcare utilization after telephone nursing and we found no evidence of model deficiencies. A patient's compliance to the nurse's recommendation varies and depends on the recommended level of care, its agreement with and level of the patient's prior intention, and the availability of different care options at the time. The model reveals a risk reducing behavior among patients and the effect of the telephone nursing recommendation is 7 times higher than the effect of the patient's intended action prior to consultation if the recommendation is the highest level of care. But the effect of the nurse's recommendation is lower, or even non-existing, if the recommendation is self-care. Telephone nursing was found to have a constricting effect on healthcare utilization, however, the compliance to nurse's recommendation is closely tied to perceptions of risk, emphasizing the importance to address caller's needs of reassurance.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.burns.2017.11.005},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemedicine is increasingly applied in developed settings to facilitate transfer of information to and from burn surgeons across vast geographic areas. WhatsApp is a widely available and extremely user-friendly encrypted smartphone application that does not require the expensive physical and personnel infrastructure that characterizes many of these telemedicine systems. The aim of this study was to review the use of WhatsApp to facilitate paediatric burn injury consultations to a regional burn centre in a developing country, where burn care continues to be thwarted by administrative apathy, poor resource allocation and lack of attention to medical and nursing education at all levels.
METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of all consultations using WhatsApp over an 18-month period, received by the burn centre's two senior medical practitioners. The specific origin and nature of the telemedicine requests for advice, transfer or follow-up were collected, as were data relating to the demographics of the patients, the aetiology, mechanism and extent of the burn injury. The impact of the system of communication in terms of reductions in admissions and clinic visits was assessed, and a cost analysis was undertaken. Feedback was also obtained from those health practitioners regularly using the service.
RESULTS: 838 communications occurred during the study period, which included 1562 distinct clinical queries. 486 interactions (58\%) originated from within the hospital, the majority of which were initiated by surgeons in training or burn nurse practitioners. 352 (42\%) consultations were from outside the hospital. Queries related to the full spectrum of burn care, including emergency management and stabilization, triage and transfer, the need for escharotomy, fluid resuscitation, wound care, the timing and nature of surgical intervention, as well as follow-up and rehabilitation. While no significant changes in the number of surgical interventions or admissions were observed when compared to the five years prior to the intervention, outpatient visits reduced significantly during the study period. It was estimated that over 150 unnecessary admissions were also avoided as a result of the triage made possible by WhatsApp, which translated into considerable cost saving for the institution.
DISCUSSION: Incorporating WhatsApp technology into the daily processes of burn care has significantly improved the quality of paediatric burn care referrals to specialist burn services. Specifically, WhatsApp has contributed to reductions in unnecessary referrals and outpatient visits, facilitated opportunities for continuing medical education, improved the care of major burn injuries through more effective prehospital communication, and enabled greater allocation of scarce specialist resources at the burn centre. This study motivates for the wider application of WhatsApp for burn care referrals, especially in developing countries.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite its rapid expansion, little is known about use of direct to consumer (DTC) telemedicine.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize telemedicine patients and physicians and correlates of patient satisfaction DESIGN: Cross-sectional study PARTICIPANTS: Patients and physicians of a large nationwide DTC telemedicine service MAIN MEASURES: Patient characteristics included demographics and whether or not they reported insurance information. Physician characteristics included specialty, board certification, and domestic versus international medical training. Encounter characteristics included time of day, wait time, length, coupon use for free or reduced-cost care, diagnostic outcome, prescription receipt, and patient/physician geographic concordance. Patients rated satisfaction with physicians on scales of 0 to 5 stars and reported where they would have sought care had they not used telemedicine. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with 5-star physician ratings.
KEY RESULTS: The analysis included 28,222 encounters between 24,040 patients and 277 physicians completed between January 2013 and August 2016. Sixty-five percent of patients were under 40 years and 32\% did not report insurance information. Family medicine was the most common physician specialty (47\%) and 16\% trained at a non-US medical school. Coupons were used in 24\% of encounters. Respiratory infections were diagnosed in 35\% of encounters and 69\% resulted in a prescription. Had they not used telemedicine, 43\% of patients reported they would have used urgent care/retail clinic, 29\% would have gone to the doctor's office, 15\% would have done nothing, and 6\% would have gone to the emergency department. Eighty-five percent of patients rated their physician 5 stars. High satisfaction was positively correlated with prescription receipt (OR 2.98; 95\%CI 2.74-3.23) and coupon use (OR 1.47; 95\%CI 1.33-1.62).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients were largely satisfied with DTC telemedicine, yet satisfaction varied by coupon use and prescription receipt. The impact of telemedicine on primary care and emergency department use is likely to be small under present usage patterns.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Princess Alexandra Hospital Telehealth Centre (PAH-TC) is a project jointly funded by the Australian national government and Queensland Health. It seeks to provide a whole-of-hospital telehealth service using videoconferencing and store-and-forward capabilities for a range of specialities. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the introduction of a new telehealth coordination service provided by a tertiary hospital centre increased telehealth activities of a tertiary hospital. Evaluation included service delivery records and stakeholder satisfaction.
METHODS: Telehealth service delivery model before and after the establishment of the centre is described as well as the project implementation. The study retrieved data related to the number and scope of previous, and current, telehealth service episodes, to ascertain any change in activity levels following the introduction of the new telehealth coordination service. In addition, using a cross-sectional research design, the satisfaction of patients, clinicians and administrators was surveyed. The survey focused on technical utility and perceived clinical validity.
RESULTS: Introduction of a new centralised telehealth coordination service was associated with an increase in the scope of telehealth from five medical disciplines, in the year before the establishment, to 34 disciplines two years after the establishment. The telehealth consultations also increases from 412 (the year before), to 735 (one year after) and 1642 (two years after) the establishment of the centre. Respondents to the surveys included patients (27), clinicians who provided the consultations (10) and clinical or administrative staff who hosted the telehealth consultations in the remote site (8). There were high levels of agreement in relation to the telehealth option saving time and money, and an important health service delivery model. There was evidence from the remote site that modifying roles to incorporate this new service was challenging.
CONCLUSION: The introduction of a centralised coordination for telehealth service of a tertiary hospital was associated with the increase in the scope and level of telehealth activity of the hospital. The project and model of health care delivery described in this paper can be adopted by tertiary hospitals to grow their telehealth activities, and potentially reduce costs associated with the delivery of services at a distance.},

Such individuals generally have multiple and complex health care problems, which if left untreated, require them to seek care in hospital emergency rooms which are vastly overcrowded.

METHODS: Data were obtained through literature review and personal observation.
RESULTS: Sub-Saharan Africa has a great burden of disease and an extreme shortage of health workers. Its countries are poor and the majority of its population rural. Telemedicine for clinical practice and education of health workers is seen as a possible means of addressing some of the health problems of Africa. A number of factors have been identified that impede the use of telemedicine in sub-Saharan Africa. These include, poverty, shortage of human resources, very limited existing infrastructure, lack of connectivity, high connectivity costs, lack of capacity development and policy issues. Examples of successful use of telemedicine and tele-educational programmes in Africa to develop capacity in health are given.
CONCLUSIONS: Initiatives to develop capacity through tele-education appear to have been well received and are more successful than clinical telemedicine. There is need to raise awareness of telemedicine if it is to assist in developing ehealth capacity in Africa.},

	abstract = {In recent years there is growing pressure on the medical sector to reduce costs while maintaining or even improving the quality of care. A potential solution to this problem is real time and/or remote patient monitoring by using mobile devices. To achieve this, medical sensors with wireless communication, computational and energy harvesting capabilities are networked on, or in, the human body forming what is commonly called a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). We present the implementation of a novel Wake Up Receiver (WUR) in the context of standardised wireless protocols, in a signal-oriented WBAN environment and present a novel protocol intended for wireless health monitoring (WhMAC). WhMAC is a TDMA-based protocol with very low power consumption. It utilises WBAN-specific features and a novel ultra low power wake up receiver technology, to achieve flexible and at the same time very low power wireless data transfer of physiological signals. As the main application is in the medical domain, or personal health monitoring, the protocol caters for different types of medical sensors. We define four sensor modes, in which the sensors can transmit data, depending on the sensor type and emergency level. A full power dissipation model is provided for the protocol, with individual hardware and application parameters. Finally, an example application shows the reduction in the power consumption for different data monitoring scenarios.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The economic impact of 9,039 LFTs performed in 51 health centers (2010-2013) using telespirometry (TS) compared to standard spirometry (SS) was studied.
RESULTS: TS costs more per unit than SS (€47.80 vs. €39.70) (2013), but the quality of the TS procedure is superior (84\% good quality, compared to 61\% using the standard procedure). Total cost of TS was €431,974 (compared with €358,306€ for SS), generating an economic impact of €73,668 (2013). The increase in cost for good quality LFT performed using TS was €34,030 (2010) and €144,295 (2013), while the costs of poor quality tests fell by €15,525 (2010) and 70,627€ (2013).
CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness analysis concludes that TS is 23\% more expensive and 46\% more effective. Healthcare costs consequently fall as the number of LFTs performed by TS rises. Avoiding poor quality, invalid LFTs generates savings that compensate for the increased costs of performing LFTs with TS, making it a cost-effective method.},

                    Pharmacist teleconsultations, combined with home drug delivery or mail-order pharmacy (MOP), can help hospital outpatients with difficulties accessing treatment. The objectives of this study are to describe a teleconsultation protocol and to evaluate clinical, economic, and patient-perceived quality results.
                        Materials and Methods:
                    A cohort observational study was carried out for 3 years on HIV outpatients. Clinical variables were adherence, plasma HIV-RNA, and CD4+ levels. A pharmacoeconomic analysis was carried out through a cost-minimization study. Patient-perceived quality was assessed through a satisfaction survey. Simple random sampling was performed for 95\% safety, accuracy ±1\%, and losses ±20\%.
                        Results:
                    The 38 participants (sample size) consisted of 82\% male patients, aged 44.7 ± 8.4 years. There were 854 teleconsultations and 100\% treatment adherence. All HIV outpatients kept virally suppressed (p = 1.00) and maintained a controlled immunological level (p = 0.87). The economic evaluation revealed 137 ± 23 € patient/year costs-saved and 18.5 ± 7.2 h/patient/year working time gained. Patient-perceived quality average score was {\textgreater}9.4 out of 10 in all items; the most valued factors were the saving of direct costs and reconciliation with work commitments (45\%) and the least valued attributes were making the payment for the shipment and having to adjust to a telephone appointment (41\%).
                        Discussion/Conclusions:
                    A teleconsultation protocol associated with home antiretrovirals delivery or MOP obtains a high degree of satisfaction from the HIV hospital outpatients receiving treatment, without repercussions on the therapeutic objectives and with the saving of important direct costs for the patient and indirect costs in relation to labor productivity.},

OBJECTIVES: The Home Blood Pressure Telemonitoring and Case Management to Control Hypertension study (HyperLink) is a cluster-randomized trial designed to determine whether an intervention that combines home BP telemonitoring with pharmacist case management improves BP control compared to usual care at 6 and 12 months in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Secondary outcomes are maintenance of BP control at 18 months, patient satisfaction with their health care, and costs of care.
METHODS: HyperLink enrolled 450 hypertensive patients with uncontrolled BP from 16 primary care clinics. Eight clinics were randomized to provide usual care (UC) to their patients (n=222) and 8 were randomized to provide the telemonitoring intervention (TI) (n=228). TI patients received home BP telemonitors that internally store and electronically transmit BP data to a secure database. Pharmacist case managers adjust antihypertensive therapy based on the home BP data under a collaborative practice agreement with the clinics' primary care teams. The length of the intervention is 12 months, with follow-up to 18 months to determine the durability of the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: We will test in a real primary care setting whether combining BP telemonitoring and pharmacist case management can achieve and maintain high rates of BP control compared to usual care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite advances in testing and treatment, HIV incidence rates within European countries are at best stable or else increasing. mHealth technology has been advocated to increase quality and cost-effectiveness of health services while dealing with growing patient numbers. However, studies suggested that mHealth apps are rarely adopted and often considered to be of low quality by users. Only a few studies (conducted in the United States) have involved people living with HIV (PLWH) in the design of mHealth.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to facilitate a co-design process among PLWH and clinicians across 5 clinical sites in the European Union to inform the development of an mHealth platform to be integrated into clinical care pathways. We aimed to (1) elicit experiences of living with HIV and of working in HIV care, (2) identify mHealth functionalities that are considered useful for HIV care, and (3) identify potential benefits as well as concerns about mHealth.
METHODS: Between January and June 2016, 14 co-design workshops and 22 semistructured interviews were conducted, involving 97 PLWH and 63 clinicians. Data were analyzed thematically and iteratively, drawing on grounded theory techniques.
RESULTS: Findings were established into 3 thematic clusters: (1) approaching the mHealth platform, (2) imagining the mHealth platform, and (3) anticipating the mHealth platform's implications. Co-design participants approached the mHealth platform with pre-existing concerns arising from their experiences of receiving or providing care. PLWH particularly addressed issues of stigma and questioned how mHealth could enable them to manage their HIV. Clinicians problematized the compatibility of mHealth with existing information technology systems and questioned which patients should be targeted by mHealth. Imagining the potential of mHealth for HIV care, co-design participants suggested medical functionalities (accessing test results, managing medicines and appointments, and digital communication channels), social functionalities (peer support network, international travel, etc), and general features (security and privacy, credibility, language, etc). Co-design participants also anticipated potential implications of mHealth for self-management and the provision of care.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach to co-design enabled us to facilitate early engagement in the mHealth platform, enabling patient and clinician feedback to become embedded in the development process at a preprototype phase. Although the technologies in question were not yet present, understanding how users approach, imagine, and anticipate technology formed an important source of knowledge and proved highly significant within the technology design and development process.},

	abstract = {The use of telemedicine technologies by primary care pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, and pediatric surgical specialists (henceforth referred to as "pediatric physicians") has the potential to transform the practice of pediatrics. The purpose of this policy statement is to describe the expected and potential impact that telemedicine will have on pediatric physicians' efforts to improve access and physician workforce shortages. The policy statement also describes how the American Academy of Pediatrics can advocate for its members and their patients to best use telemedicine technologies to improve access to care, provide more patient- and family-centered care, increase efficiencies in practice, enhance the quality of care, and address projected shortages in the clinical workforce. As the use of telemedicine increases, it is likely to impact health care access, quality, and education and costs of care. Telemedicine technologies, applied to the medical home and its collaborating providers, have the potential to improve current models of care by increasing communication among clinicians, resulting in more efficient, higher quality, and less expensive care. Such a model can serve as a platform for providing more continuous care, linking primary and specialty care to support management of the needs of complex patients. In addition, telemedicine technologies can be used to efficiently provide pediatric physicians working in remote locations with ongoing medical education, increasing their ability to care for more complex patients in their community, reducing the burdens of travel on patients and families, and supporting the medical home. On the other hand, telemedicine technologies used for episodic care by nonmedical home providers have the potential to disrupt continuity of care and to create redundancy and imprudent use of health care resources. Fragmentation should be avoided, and telemedicine, like all primary and specialty services, should be coordinated through the medical home.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence shows that the implementation of information and communication technologies (ICT) enabled services supporting integrated dementia care represents an opportunity that faces multi-pronged challenges. First, the provision of dementia support is fragmented and often inappropriate. Second, available ICT solutions in this field do not address the full spectrum of support needs arising across an individual's whole dementia journey. Current solutions fail to harness the potential of available validated e-health services, such as telehealth and telecare, for the purposes of dementia care. Third, there is a lack of understanding of how viable business models in this field can operate. The field comprises both professional and non-professional players that interact and have roles to play in ensuring that useful technologies are developed, implemented and used.
METHODS: Starting from a literature review, including relevant pilot projects for ICT-based dementia care, we define the major requirements of a system able to overcome the limitations evidenced in the literature, and how this system should be integrated in the socio-technical ecosystem characterizing this disease. From here, we define the DEDICATE architecture of such a system, and the conceptual framework mapping the architecture over the requirements.
RESULTS: We identified three macro-requirements, namely the need to overcome: deficient technology innovation, deficient service process innovation, and deficient business models innovation. The proposed architecture is a three level architecture in which the center (data layer) includes patients' and informal caregivers' preferences, memories, and other personal data relevant to sustain the dementia journey, is connected through a middleware (service layer), which guarantees core IT services and integration, to dedicated applications (application layer) to sustain dementia care (formal support services, FSS), and to existing formal care infrastructures, in order to guarantee care coordination (care coordination services, CCS).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed DEDICATE architecture and framework envisages a feasible means to overcome the present barriers by: (1) developing and integrating technologies that can follow the patient and the caregivers throughout the development of the condition, since the early stages in which the patient is able to build up preferences and memories will be used in the later stages to maximise personalization and thereby improve efficacy and usability (technology innovation); (2) guaranteeing the care coordination between formal and informal caregivers, and giving an active yet supported role to the latter (service innovation); and (3) integrating existing infrastructures and care models to decrease the cost of the overall care pathway, by improving system interoperability (business model innovation).},

	doi = {10.1136/bmjresp-2017-000238},
	abstract = {Introduction: Ventilation parameter data from patients receiving home mechanical ventilation can be collected via secure data cards and modem technology. This can then be reviewed by clinicians and ventilator prescriptions adjusted. Typically available measures include tidal volume (VT), leak, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, patient triggered breaths, achieved pressures and patient compliance. This study aimed to assess the potential impact of ventilator data downloads on management of patients requiring home non-invasive ventilation (NIV).
Methods: A longitudinal within-group design with repeated measurements was used. Baseline ventilator data were downloaded, reviewed and adjustments made to optimise ventilation. Leak, VT and compliance data were collected for comparison at the first review and 3-7 weeks later. Ventilator data were monitored and amended remotely via a modem by a consultant physiotherapist between the first review and second appointment.
Results: Analysis of data from 52 patients showed increased patient compliance (\% days used {\textgreater}4 hours) from 90\% to 96\% (p=0.007), increased usage from 6.53 to 6.94 hours (p=0.211) and a change in VT(9.4 vs 8.7 mL/kg/ideal body weight, p=0.022). There was no change in leak following review of NIV prescriptions (mean (SD): 43 (23.4) L/min vs 45 (19.9)L/min, p=0.272).
Conclusion: Ventilator data downloads, via early remote assessment, can help optimise patient ventilation through identification of modifiable factors, in particular interface leak and ventilator prescriptions. However, a prospective study is required to assess whether using ventilator data downloads provides value in terms of patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness. The presented data will help to inform the design of such a study.},

	abstract = {The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released the proposed 2017 Medicare physician fee schedule on July 7, 2016, addressing Medicare payments for physicians providing services either in an office or facility setting, which also includes payments for office expenses and quality provisions for physicians. This proposed rule occurs in the context of numerous policy changes, most notably related to the Medicare Access \& CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) and its Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). The proposed rule affects interventional pain management specialists in reimbursement for evaluation and management services, as well as procedures performed in a facility or in-office setting.Changes in the proposed fee schedule impacting interventional pain management practices include adjustments to the meaningful use (MU) program, care management in patient-centered services, identification and review of potentially misvalued services, evaluation of moderate sedation services, Medicare telehealth services, updated geographic practice cost index, data collection on resources used in furnishing global services, reporting of modifier 25 for zero day global services, Medicare Advantage Part C provider and supplier enrollment, appropriate use criteria (AUC) for advanced imaging services, and Medicare shared savings programs. The proposed schedule has provided rates for new epidural codes with or without imaging (fluoroscopy or computed tomography [CT]) and a fee schedule for a new code covering endoscopic spinal decompression. Review of payment rates show major discrepancies in payment schedules with high payments for hospitals, 2,156\% higher than in-office procedures. Some procedures which were converted from in-office settings to ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) are being reimbursed at 1,366\% higher than ASCs. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) recommendation on avoiding the discrepancies and site-of-service differentials in in-office settings, hospital outpatient settings, and ASCs has not been agreed to by CMS. Thus, even though the changes appear to be minor in physician services and in-office service payment, these changes cumulatively have been reducing payments for interventional procedures. Further, in-office reimbursement is overall significantly lower than ASCs and hospital outpatient departments (HOPDs) specifically for intraarticular injections, peripheral nerve blocks, and peripheral neurolytic injections. The significant advantage also continues for hospitals in their reimbursement for facility fee for evaluation and management services.This health policy review describes various issues related to health care expenses, health care reform, and finally its effects on physician payments for all services and also for the services provided in an office setting.},

The study used a dataset of discharges from public hospitals of Northern Territory residents between July 2007 and June 2009. Multivariate regression analysis was used to estimate the variation in average costs, using the logarithm of patient cost as the dependent variable and Major Diagnostic Categories (MDCs), hospitals and population subgroups (Indigenous v. non-Indigenous; urban v. remote) as independent variables. Although much of the additional cost of Indigenous and remote patients was found to be due to differences in severity and complexity between MDCs, there were extra costs for remote Indigenous patients that were not captured by the classification system. Hospitals servicing larger than average proportions of these patients could be systematically underfunded within an ABF framework unless a price adjustment is applied.},

	abstract = {With the advent of accountable care organizations, bundled payments, value-based purchasing, and penalties for preventable hospital readmission, tight connections and collaboration across the care continuum will become critical to achieve successful patient outcomes and to reduce the cost of care delivery. Lehigh Valley Health Network (LVHN), the largest provider of health services in eastern Pennsylvania, set out on a journey to build collaborative relationships with skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in their eastern Pennsylvania community. LVHN desired SNF partners with mutual interests in improving quality of care and lowering costs of delivery where possible. Recognizing that not all SNFs are alike, LVHN developed a Collaborative Partner Prioritization Tool to assess and prioritize skilled nursing facilities in an effort to determine those that would make the best collaborators. SNFs were reviewed based on their volume of mutual patients, quality of care delivery, and their perceived willingness to align with LVHN. Six variables were used to assess these facilities, including (1) patient discharge destination volume by SNF; (2) 30-day all-cause readmission rate to an LVHN hospital; (3) Medicare's Nursing Home Compare 5-Star Overall Rating; (4) the health network affiliation of the SNF's medical director; (5) the level of LVHN-employed or -affiliated physician presence at the SNF; and (6) the SNF's current participation in LVHN-sponsored programs and meetings. Through use of the Collaborative Partner Prioritization Tool, it was discovered that roughly 70\% of LVHN patients who required skilled nursing care following their inpatient stay received care at 1 of 20 SNFs. Of these, 5 facilities performed well on the 6-variable assessment, deeming them the "Tier 1 Facilities" to initially focus collaborative efforts. LVHN has strategically deployed physician resources and has increased physician presence at these "Tier 1 SNFs." These facilities have also gained remote read-only access to LVHN's inpatient electronic medical record and have had opportunity to participate in LVHN-sponsored programs. Special projects have been co-developed with several SNFs, including a telemedicine-based Parkinson's disease program to increase patient access to a neurologist specially trained in movement disorders. The Collaborative Partner Prioritization Tool has become a powerful tool when used for prioritization of relationships and allocation of LVHN physicians and resources. Collaboration with strong SNF partners has offered a shared opportunity to improve quality of care, reduce costs, and prepare for the many policies affecting the health care industry. Future outcomes of this work will include quality metrics, such as readmissions, patient satisfaction with care, time for decision to admit, and overall costs of care. The data and metrics used to define the prioritization tool will continue to be adapted as the post-acute market and hospital-SNF relationships continue to evolve.},

Our objective in this paper is to present an integrated review of the impact of mHealth interventions for community dwelling individuals with type two diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed using keywords in PubMed to identify research studies which mHealth technology was used as the intervention.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Interventions using mHealth have been found to improve outcomes, be cost effective, and culturally relevant. mHealth technology that has been used to improve outcomes include: seeking out health information via the web, access to appointment scheduling and medication refills, secure messaging, computerized interventions to manage a chronic condition, use of a personal health record, use of remote monitoring devices, and seeking support from others with similar health concerns through social networks.
CONCLUSION: Using the validated Chronic Care Model to translate what is known about mHealth technology to clinical practice has the potential to improve the ability of healthcare providers in rural areas to provide care, improve access to care for underserved populations, and improve biophysical outcomes of care for persons with diabetes in rural underserved populations. While these approaches were effective in improving some outcomes, they have not resulted in the establishment of the necessary electronic infrastructure for a sustainable mobile healthcare delivery model.},

Moreover, the services are concentrated in the urban areas, further worsening the rural-urban and tertiary primary care divide. Strengthening of and expanding the existing human resources and infrastructure, and integrating mental health into primary care appear to be the two major solutions. However, both the strategies are riddled with logistic difficulties and have a long gestation period. In such a scenario, telepsychiatry or e-mental health, defined as the use of information and communication technology to provide or support psychiatric services across distances, appears to be a promising answer. Due to its enormous potential, a review of the existing literature becomes imperative. An extensive search of literature was carried out and has been presented to delineate the modes of communication, acceptability and satisfaction, reliability, outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and legal and ethical challenges related to telepsychiatry. Telepsychiatry has been applied for direct patient care (diagnosis and management), consultation, and training, education, and research purposes. Both real-time, live interaction (synchronous) and store-forward (asynchronous) types of technologies have been used for these purposes. A growing amount of literature shows that training, supervision, and consultation by specialists to primary care physicians through telepsychiatry has several advantages. In this background, we have further focused on the models of telepsychiatry best suited for India, considering that mental health care can be integrated into primary care and taken to the doorstep of patients in the community.},

Following our recent experience with the INteractive teleConsultation network for worldwide healthcAre Services (INCAS) system, we designed a simpler point-to-point telehealth infrastructure, to be employed in cardiovascular risk reduction programs, predicting a high level of acceptance from the population, at the cost of very limited investment. This model was tested on 181 subjects (ages 18-80 years) in the Italian mountain village of Esino Lario. These subjects underwent a screening test to evaluate arrhythmia and cardiometabolic risks (arrhythmias were found in 14\% of subjects, systolic arterial pressure was observed in 43\% of subjects above 140 mm Hg, diastolic arterial pressure in 31\% above 90 mm Hg).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: For chronic kidney disease patients who progress to end-stage renal disease, survival is dependent on renal replacement therapy in the form of kidney transplantation or chronic dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis (PD), which can be performed at home, is both more convenient and less costly than hemodialysis that requires three 4-h visits per week to the dialysis facility and complicated equipment. Remote therapy management (RTM), technologies that collect medical information and transmit it to healthcare providers for patient management, has the potential to improve the outcomes of patients receiving automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) at home.
OBJECTIVE: Estimate through a simulation study the potential impact of RTM on APD patients use of healthcare resources and costs in the United States, Germany, and Italy.
METHODS: Twelve APD patient profiles were developed to reflect potential clinical scenarios of APD therapy. Two versions of each profile were created to simulate healthcare resource use, one assuming use of RTM and one with no RTM. Eleven APD teams (one nephrologist, one nurse) estimated resources that would be used.
RESULTS: Results from U.S., German, and Italian clinicians found that RTM could avoid use of 59, 49, and 16 resources over the 12 profiles, respectively. Estimated reduced utilization across the three countries ranged from one to two hospitalizations, one to four home visits, two to five emergency room visits, and four to eight unplanned clinic visits. Total savings across all scenarios were \$23,364 in the United States, \$11,477 in Germany, and \$7,088 in Italy.
CONCLUSION: In a simulated environment, early intervention enabled by RTM reduced healthcare resource utilization and associated costs.},

	abstract = {The medical organizations have introduced Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) to provide a reliable facility by which a patient who is unable to go to a doctor in critical or urgent period, can communicate to a doctor through a medical server via internet from home. An authentication mechanism is needed in TMIS to hide the secret information of both parties, namely a server and a patient. Recent research includes patient's biometric information as well as password to design a remote user authentication scheme that enhances the security level. In a single server environment, one server is responsible for providing services to all the authorized remote patients. However, the problem arises if a patient wishes to access several branch servers, he/she needs to register to the branch servers individually. In 2014, Chuang and Chen proposed an remote user authentication scheme for multi-server environment. In this paper, we have shown that in their scheme, an non-register adversary can successfully logged-in into the system as a valid patient. To resist the weaknesses, we have proposed an authentication scheme for TMIS in multi-server environment where the patients can register to a root telecare server called registration center (RC) in one time to get services from all the telecare branch servers through their registered smart card. Security analysis and comparison shows that our proposed scheme provides better security with low computational and communication cost.},

A quasi-randomized study design was used, with a panel of 20 emergency medicine doctors who independently reviewed previously-stored consultations using the two modalities. In total, 60 case reviews were conducted during five sessions, representing 33 different cases from the routine workload of Minor Treatment Centres in Scotland. More experienced doctors transferred fewer patients than less experienced doctors. The proportion of patients transferred was higher when PACS was used than when video was used in most of the cases. A mixed effects logistic regression model was fitted to the data. The estimated odds for patient transfer were 56\% lower when video was used instead of PACS (odds ratio 0.44, 95\% confidence interval 0.20, 0.93). Although the cost implications are not yet known, video support for local decision-making should remain the preferred method of telemedicine for minor injuries work.},

Video-games may also be integrated into an infrastructure that allows patients, discharged from the hospital, to continue intensive rehabilitation at home under remote monitoring by the hospital itself, as suggested by the recently funded Rewire project.
OBJECTIVE: Goal of this work is to describe a novel low cost platform, based on video-games, targeted to neglect rehabilitation.
METHODS: The patient is guided to explore his neglected hemispace by a set of specifically designed games that ask him to reach targets, with an increasing level of difficulties. Visual and auditory cues helped the patient in the task and are progressively removed. A controlled randomization of scenarios, targets and distractors, a balanced reward system and music played in the background, all contribute to make rehabilitation more attractive, thus enabling intensive prolonged treatment.
RESULTS: Results from our first patient, who underwent rehabilitation for half an hour, for five days a week for one month, showed on one side a very positive attitude of the patient towards the platform for the whole period, on the other side a significant improvement was obtained. Importantly, this amelioration was confirmed at a follow up evaluation five months after the last rehabilitation session and generalized to everyday life activities.
CONCLUSIONS: Such a system could well be integrated into a home based rehabilitation system.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on pediatric care of the Pacific Asynchronous TeleHealth (PATH) system, a provider-to-provider teleconsultation platform utilized by military medical facilities throughout the Pacific Region. This review focuses on access to care, quality of care, and cost savings for the Department of Defense as a result of ongoing development of the PATH system from 2006 to 2009.
METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 1,000 consecutive teleconsultations occurring from January 2006 to March 2009. Three pediatric subspecialists reviewed the characteristics of each teleconsultation and the ultimate outcome.
RESULTS: The PATH system processed {\textgreater} 300 pediatric teleconsultations in 2009 from 20 hospitals and clinics throughout the Pacific Region. The number of teleconsultations has grown significantly since 2006. Median teleconsultation response time was 14.5 h with 97\% of teleconsultations answered within 1 week. The majority (75\%) of teleconsultations came from areas without host nation pediatric subspecialty resources. Most teleconsultations (72\%) involved diagnostic questions, whereas 21\% were primarily for treatment issues. Teleconsultations originated predominantly from outpatient clinics (90\%), with question resolution in 60\% of cases without a face-to-face subspecialty evaluation. Fifteen percent of teleconsultations resulted in patient transfer to our center for definitive diagnosis and treatment. The diagnostic and/or treatment plan was modified in 74\% of teleconsultations. PATH precluded patient transfer in 12\%-43\% of teleconsultations (annual savings: \$208,283-\$746,348 per year) and generated an average of 1.7 relative value units per teleconsultation.
CONCLUSIONS: PATH provided patient access to pediatric subspecialty expertise via provider-to-provider asynchronous teleconsultation. Internet-based pediatric subspecialty teleconsultation provides fast, convenient, cost-effective, quality pediatric care to populations of patients who might otherwise require transfer to a distant medical facility for more advanced care. PATH serves as a model for future asynchronous teleconsultation platforms in both the military and civilian healthcare arenas.},

Telehealth approaches to care offer an important means of reducing costs as well as increasing autonomy for patients. Understanding patient satisfaction with telehealth provides a key towards eventual scalability.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quarterly surveys were conducted to characterize satisfaction with remote biometric monitoring (RBM) for blood pressure, weight, glucose and peritoneal dialysis (PD)-specific educational online videos for ESRD patients using PD.
RESULTS: Of 300 participants, 67\% participated in the surveys and provided baseline and at least one follow-up assessment. The majority were 45 to 64 years of age (50.5\%), Black (64.5\%), married or living with significant other (52.0\%), and had more than a high school degree (73.0\%). RBM was associated with perceived autonomy and confidence in health care activities and decreased negative perceptions of PD care and ESRD. The majority of participants (80.1\%) indicated that they were satisfied or completely satisfied with the system. Participants found that the interface increased confidence, reduced frustration, and related perceptions were significantly and positively altered (p{\textless}0.05) for each of the separate telehealth components. Educational videos were well utilized with nearly half of the participants (42.5\%) reporting that they watched at least one of the videos, and the majority reporting that the videos seen had an overall positive impact on health.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing PD with telehealth has the potential to have a positive impact on patient perceptions of PD care and consequently improve clinical outcomes.},

METHODS: First we consider the current status of Telehealth based on some state-of-the-art reviews. Then we present some new future modes of Telehealth services, as described by various prominent authors. From these we identify some common directional themes and fundamental issues affecting the success of future Telehealth innovations.
RESULTS: This position paper advances a view that Telehealth in the future will be much more driven by widespread pressure from two different drivers: more ubiquitous connectivity and related technological capabilities due to greater diversity in human communication practices, and new models of care emerging from diverse widespread movements towards health services reform.
CONCLUSION: The IMIA Working Group on Telehealth work agenda will address some specific items within the areas described above.},

In a randomized controlled trial, 105 hypertensive patients performed HBPM and 118 patients received usual care with conventional office BP monitoring during 6 months. Costs were quantified from the healthcare perspective. Non-parametric simulations were performed to quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were made.
MAJOR FINDINGS: Systolic and diastolic daytime and night-time ambulatory BP (ABP) were reduced in both groups. The uncertainty around the incremental cost effectiveness ratio point estimates was considerable for both systolic and diastolic ABP. For systolic ABP, the difference in cost effectiveness ratio between the two groups was 256 Danish kroner (DKK)/mmHg [95\% uncertainty interval, UI -860 to 4544]. For diastolic ABP, the difference in cost effectiveness ratio between the two groups was 655 DKK/mmHg [95\% UI -674 to 69315]. Medication and consultation costs were lowest in the intervention group, but were offset by the cost of the telemonitoring equipment.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that telemonitoring of home BP was more costly compared with usual monitoring of office BP. The cost-effectiveness result is surrounded with considerable uncertainty.},

METHODS: Participants were randomised to receive 12 weeks of telerehabilitation or centre-based rehabilitation. REMOTE-CR provided individualised exercise prescription, real-time exercise monitoring/coaching and theory-based behavioural strategies via a bespoke telerehabilitation platform; CBexCR provided individualised exercise prescription and coaching via established rehabilitation clinics. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 and/or 24 weeks included maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max, primary) modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, exercise adherence, motivation, health-related quality of life and programme delivery, hospital service utilisation and medication costs. The primary hypothesis was a non-inferior between-group difference in V̇O2max at 12 weeks (inferiority margin=-1.25 mL/kg/min); inferiority margins were not set for secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: 162 participants (mean 61±12.7 years, 86\% men) were randomised. V̇O2 max was comparable in both groups at 12 weeks and REMOTE-CR was non-inferior to CBexCR (REMOTE-CR-CBexCR adjusted mean difference (AMD)=0.51 (95\% CI -0.97 to 1.98) mL/kg/min, p=0.48). REMOTE-CR participants were less sedentary at 24 weeks (AMD=-61.5 (95\% CI -117.8 to -5.3) min/day, p=0.03), while CBexCR participants had smaller waist (AMD=1.71 (95\% CI 0.09 to 3.34) cm, p=0.04) and hip circumferences (AMD=1.16 (95\% CI 0.06 to 2.27) cm, p=0.04) at 12 weeks. No other between-group differences were detected. Per capita programme delivery (NZD1130/GBP573 vs NZD3466/GBP1758) and medication costs (NZD331/GBP168 vs NZD605/GBP307, p=0.02) were lower for REMOTE-CR. Hospital service utilisation costs were not statistically significantly different (NZD3459/GBP1754 vs NZD5464/GBP2771, p=0.20).

Telephone interviews, site visits, and financial data from the eEmergency program of Avera Health (Sioux Falls, SD) were used to populate the categories. Avera Health information was augmented with national data where available. Three financial scenarios were then analyzed for CAH profit/loss associated with tele-emergency.
RESULTS: Tele-emergency financial analysis demonstrated an \$187,614 profit in a high revenue/low expense scenario, \$49,841 profit in a midrange scenario, and \$69,588 loss in a low revenue/high expense scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: Tele-emergency may be a profitable rural hospital service line if the participating hospital adjusts ED processes to take advantage of increased revenue/savings opportunities afforded by tele-emergency. Savings due to tele-emergency primarily accrue when physician ED backup and physician ED staffing costs are substituted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertension self-management has been shown to improve systolic blood pressure (BP) control, but longer-term economic and clinical impacts are unknown. The purpose of this article is to examine clinical and economic outcomes 18 months after completion of a hypertension self-management trial.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study is a follow-up analysis of an 18-month, 4-arm, hypertension self-management trial of 591 veterans with hypertension who were randomized to usual care or 1 of 3 interventions. Clinic-derived systolic blood pressure obtained before, during, and after the trial were estimated using linear mixed models. Inpatient admissions, outpatient expenditures, and total expenditures were estimated using generalized estimating equations. The 3 telephone-based interventions were nurse-administered health behavior promotion, provider-administered medication adjustments based on hypertension treatment guidelines, or a combination of both. Intervention calls were triggered by home BP values transmitted via telemonitoring devices. Clinical and economic outcomes were examined 12 months before, 18 months during, and 18 months after trial completion. Compared with usual care, patients randomized to the combined arm had greater improvement in proportion of BP control during and after the 18-month trial and estimated proportion of BP control improved 18 months after trial completion for patients in the behavioral and medication management arms. Among the patients with inadequate baseline BP control, estimated mean systolic BP was significantly lower in the combined arm as compared with usual care during and after the 18-month trial. Utilization and expenditure trends were similar for patients in all 4 arms.
CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and medication management can generate systolic BP improvements that are sustained 18 months after trial completion.

	abstract = {Introduction Intensivist involvement for patients with sepsis is associated with decreased complications and mortality, and lower hospital resource utilization, but few studies have evaluated outcomes for patients exposed to electronic intensive care unit (eICU) telemedicine sepsis management in the emergency department (ED). In this study, we assess whether eICU cart exposure in the ED improved compliance with components of the 2010 Surviving Sepsis Campaign bundles, length of stay (LOS), disposition and hospital costs. Methods An institutional review board-approved, retrospective cohort study was completed on patients with confirmed sepsis who presented to our ED from July 2010 through February 2013. Results Of 711 patient ED encounters, 314 cases met criteria for analysis (95 exposed and 219 non-exposed). Patient cohorts had similar demographics and comorbid International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) diagnoses. The exposed cohort received antibiotics more quickly (122.3 minutes ±83.3 versus 163.4 minutes ±204.4, p = 0.043) and were more likely to have lactic acid levels drawn within six hours (98.9\% vs. 90\%, p = 0.019). The exposed cohort had a shortened ED LOS (in days) 0.08 ± 0.28 versus 0.16 ± 0.37, p = 0.036. Hospital LOS, disposition and death were similar in both cohorts. Total hospital costs for the exposed cohort were lower and less variable (US\$19,713 ± 16,550 vs. US\$24,364 ± 25068), but this was not significant ( p = 0.274). Discussion Our findings suggest that in individuals with confirmed sepsis, ED exposure to a telemedicine-based eICU cart impacted adherence to aspects of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended bundle, but did not impact overall survival and medical costs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic minority youth have poorer asthma status than white youth, even after controlling for socioeconomic variables. Proper use of asthma controller medications is critical in reducing asthma mortality and morbidity. The clinical consequences of poor asthma management include increased illness complications, excessive functional morbidity, and fatal asthma attacks. There are significant limitations in research on interventions to improve asthma management in racial minority populations, particularly minority adolescents and young adults, although illness management tends to deteriorate after adolescence during emerging adulthood, the unique developmental period beyond adolescence but before adulthood.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the pilot study was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and signals of efficacy of an intervention targeting adherence to controller medication in African American youth (ages 18-29) with asthma. All elements of the protocol were piloted in a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-funded pilot study (1R34HL107664 MacDonell). Results suggested feasibility and acceptability of the protocol as well as proof of concept. We are now ready to test the intervention in a larger randomized clinical trial.
METHODS: The proposed study will include 192 African American emerging adults with moderate to severe persistent asthma and low controller medication adherence recruited from clinic, emergency department, and community settings. Half of the sample will be randomized to receive a multicomponent technology-based intervention targeting adherence to daily controller medication. The multicomponent technology-based intervention consists of 2 components: (1) 2 sessions of computer-delivered motivational interviewing targeting medication adherence and (2) individualized text messaging focused on medication adherence between the sessions. Text messages will be individualized based on ecological momentary assessment. The remaining participants will complete a series of computer-delivered asthma education modules matched for length, location, and method of delivery of the intervention session. Control participants will also receive text messages between intervention sessions. Message content will be the same for all control participants and contain general facts about asthma (not tailored).
RESULTS: It is hypothesized that youth randomized to multicomponent technology-based intervention will show improvements in medication adherence (primary outcome) and asthma control (secondary outcome) compared with comparison condition at all postintervention follow-ups (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). The proposed study was funded by NHLBI from September 1, 2016 through August 31, 2021.
CONCLUSIONS: This project will test a brief, technology-based intervention specifically targeting adherence to asthma controller medications in an under-researched population, African American emerging adults. If successful, our multicomponent technology-based intervention aimed at improving adherence to asthma medications has the potential to improve quality of life of minority emerging adults with asthma at relatively low cost. It could eventually be integrated into clinical settings and practice to reach a large number of emerging adults with asthma.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The aging population is at risk of common eye diseases, and routine eye examinations are recommended to prevent visual impairment. Unfortunately, patients are less likely to seek care as they age, which may be the result of significant travel and time burdens associated with going to an eye clinic in person. A new method of eye-care delivery that mitigates distance barriers and improves access was developed to improve screening for potentially blinding conditions. We present the quality data from the early experience (first 13 months) of Technology-Based Eye Care Services (TECS), a novel ophthalmologic telemedicine program.
DESIGN: With TECS, a trained ophthalmology technician is stationed in a primary care clinic away from the main hospital. The ophthalmology technician follows a detailed protocol that collects information about the patient's eyes. The information then is interpreted remotely. Patients with possible abnormal findings are scheduled for a face-to-face examination in the eye clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: Any patient with no known ocular disease who desires a routine eye screening examination is eligible.
METHODS: Technology-Based Eye Care Services was established in 5 primary care clinics in Georgia surrounding the Atlanta Veterans Affairs hospital.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Four program operation metrics (patient satisfaction, eyeglass remakes, disease detection, and visit length) and 2 access-to-care metrics (appointment wait time and no-show rate) were tracked.
RESULTS: Care was rendered to 2690 patients over the first 13 months of TECS. The program has been met with high patient satisfaction (4.95 of 5). Eyeglass remake rate was 0.59\%. Abnormal findings were noted in 36.8\% of patients and there was {\textgreater}90\% agreement between the TECS reading and the face-to-face findings of the physician. TECS saved both patient (25\% less) and physician time (50\% less), and access to care substantially improved with 99\% of patients seen within 14 days of contacting the eye clinic, with a TECS no-show rate of 5.2\%.
CONCLUSIONS: The early experience with TECS has been promising. Tele-ophthalmology has the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce cost, and significantly improve access to care. Although further study is necessary, TECS shows potential to help prevent avoidable vision loss.},

METHODS: The PONIENTE study was a controlled, non-randomised clinical trial, with data collected from informal caregivers, 12 months after implantation of pacemakers. The survey on disabilities, personal autonomy, and dependency situations was used to gather information on demographic and social characteristics, levels of professionalism, time and types of care, difficulties in providing care, health status, professional aspects, economic and family or leisure impacts due to informal caregiving for patients with pacemakers.
RESULTS: During 14 months, 76 caregivers were enrolled in the PONIENTE trial. Of which, 26 were included in the RM group and 50 in the hospital-monitored group (HM). The mean ages were 58.62 ± 16.51 and 61.10 ± 12.67 years, respectively (p = 0.56) in the groups, and 69.7 \% were females. The majority (96.1 \%) of the caregivers declared that they had to provide their services between 6 and 7 days per week (88.5 \% in RM group versus 100 \% in HM group; p = 0.037). The costs related to care provided by the informal caregivers were 21.38 \% lower in the RM group than in the HM group (p = 0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: The PONIENTE study shows a significant impact of informal care on relatives and friends of patients with pacemakers in terms of their well-being and costs.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The Stanford University Network for the Diagnosis of Retinopathy of Prematurity (SUNDROP) initiative-an ongoing telemedicine-based initiative for in-hospital screening of high-risk infants for treatment-warranted ROP (TW-ROP)-has been shown to be a safe, reliable, and cost-effective supplement to the efforts of ROP specialists. We utilized data collected in the SUNDROP initiative to determine demographic (birth weight, sex, multiplicity), weight gain, and ocular imaging (media haze, peripapillary atrophy, fundus pigmentation) predictors of TW-ROP.
METHODS: This was a retrospective nested case-control study. Cases and controls were selected from a cohort of 843 low birth weight, premature newborns who survived to an estimated gestational age of 31 weeks and underwent screening through the SUNDROP initiative. Infants were screened at one of six neonatal intensive care units from December 1, 2005, to April 1, 2016. Cases (n = 37) were newborns with TW-ROP who underwent retinal ablative therapy. Two controls (n = 74) without TW-ROP were matched to each case by gestational age. One reviewer graded media haze, presence of peripapillary atrophy, and fundus pigmentation in images taken at the baseline exam for each newborn. The main outcome measure was association of TW-ROP with predictive factors.
RESULTS: In the SUNDROP trial, 37 out of 843 (4.4\%) newborns developed TW-ROP. In a multivariable model, birth weight (OR, 0.32; 95\% CI, 0.15-0.70) was inversely associated with TW-ROP. In contrast to prior reports, we found no significant difference in sex, multiplicity, or fundus pigmentation at baseline exam in those with TW-ROP as compared to controls. High levels of media haze ({\textgreater}2, scale 0 to 5) were found in the majority of cases (67.6\%, 25/37) and controls (65.7\%, 44/67). Presence of peripapillary atrophy did not improve prediction of the development of TW-ROP compared to birth weight and weight gain rate alone.
CONCLUSIONS: The finding of high levels of media haze at baseline ROP screening exams is novel. This study supports the current model for detection of TW-ROP using birth weight, gestational age, and weight gain rate. We found no significant difference between newborns with TW-ROP and controls in baseline presence of media haze, fundus pigmentation or peripapillary atrophy.},

Practical, safe, and cost-effective, this simple tool can also potentially improve patients' understanding toward their own diseases via knowledge enhancement. This study was designed to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of an SMS-based epilepsy educational program for epilepsy patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective randomized interventional study. Epilepsy outpatients from three general hospitals in East Coast Peninsular Malaysia received the SMS-based mobile epilepsy educational system (MEES) for a 3-month period.
RESULTS: In total, 51 patients completed the study (median age, 25.0 years; 51.0\% female; 92.2\% Malay; 56.9\% single; education level, 70.6\% ≤SPM/Cambridge O-level equivalent; 25.5\% supportive workers; monthly income, 58.8\% ≤MYR 500.0/USD 158.5). Approximately 86.0\% of the patients owned at least a mobile phone. The total cost of SMS delivery was economically affordable (MYR 3.08/USD 0.98 per patient). Overall, 74.0\% agreed that MEES was either very or quite useful. It is encouraging that the majority of patients have offered positive comments and favorable opinions specifically toward epilepsy education (94.0\%), drug-taking reminder (90.0\%), and clinic appointment reminder (88.0\%). It was also reported that 88.2\% of the participants would recommend MEES to other people with epilepsy.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study adds to the growing evidence suggesting that a greater investment in telemedicine programs involving SMS would be both feasible and well received by patients and could be a potentially valuable approach to increase access and effectiveness of epilepsy care.},

The protection of patient's privacy is a key issue due to the openness of communication environment. Authentication as a typical approach is adopted to guarantee confidential and authorized interaction between the patient and remote server. In order to achieve the goals, numerous remote authentication schemes based on cryptography have been presented. Recently, Arshad et al. (J Med Syst 38(12): 2014) presented a secure and efficient three-factor authenticated key exchange scheme to remedy the weaknesses of Tan et al.'s scheme (J Med Syst 38(3): 2014). In this paper, we found that once a successful off-line password attack that results in an adversary could impersonate any user of the system in Arshad et al.'s scheme. In order to thwart these security attacks, an enhanced biometric and smart card based remote authentication scheme for TMISs is proposed. In addition, the BAN logic is applied to demonstrate the completeness of the enhanced scheme. Security and performance analyses show that our enhanced scheme satisfies more security properties and less computational cost compared with previously proposed schemes.},

	abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe use of home telehealth care as an alternative for chronic disease management from users' perspective.
BACKGROUND: As the population ages, telehealth is increasingly being used to tackle problems related to the fast growing ageing population. Home telehealth care therefore poses challenges and offers opportunities for patients and healthcare providers.
DESIGN: A qualitative approach was adopted with a purposeful sample of 20 patients residing in Taiwan.
METHOD: Patients who had received the service for three months and were willing to share their experiences were recruited. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews with semi-structured interview guideline (n = 8) and a focus group discussion (n = 12) in 2010. A qualitative content analysis was used.
RESULTS: Four key themes were identified: perceived support and security, enhanced disease self-management, concerned with using the devices and worries about the cost by patients. Most users favoured using the service to control their chronic conditions because of its convenience and accessibility, and their condition could be measured daily to enhance their sense of security. Users could determine and understand changes in their condition and improve medical regimen compliance, and they were empowered to revise their lifestyles for better disease self-management. However, users were concerned about the utility of the service, because they were unfamiliar with the operating procedures and doubted its quality. As the service is still in stage of pilot testing, users worried about possible cost and reimbursement policy changes in the future.
CONCLUSION: Most users perceived telehealth care was a convenient and useful model for healthcare-delivery. It increased the availability of health care and improved the self-care ability of patients.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: To advocate for home telehealth care, nurses must play an active role in providing consumers with proper training and support for any problems when adopting the system to foster patients' willingness to use this service.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of home telehealth care combined with case management by public health nurses, in improving blood pressure control in patients with hypertension.
METHODS: This cohort study examined the data of patients with hypertension obtained from a telehealth service centre database, between July 2011- June 2012. Eligible patients were adults (≥40 years old) with both prehypertension and hypertension, living alone or in the remote suburbs of metropolitan areas. Demographic data were collected from 12 district public health centre in Taipei, Taiwan. Following enrolment, patients received an appropriate and validated home telehealth device kit for automatic blood pressure monitoring and automated modem via a telephone line or a desktop computer with Internet connection to enable data transmission between the patient's home and telehealth service centre. Patients were instructed to upload the measured data immediately every day. The study outcomes included blood pressure and home telehealth service utilisation.
RESULTS: Of the 432 patients recruited, 408 (94\%) completed data collection. Linear regression analysis found an average 22.1 mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure after one year. The mean slope of systolic blood pressure was classified as decreased or non-decreased. An systolic blood pressure decreasing trend was observed in 52.2\% patients, while 47.8\% patients showed an increasing systolic blood pressure trend. Patients in the decreased systolic blood pressure group tended to be older ( p = 0. 0001), with a greater proportion of hypertension alarms ( p = 0. 001), improved self-blood pressure monitoring behaviour ( p = 0.009) and higher self-measured blood pressure monitoring frequency ( p = 0. 010). Patients in the decreased systolic blood pressure group had a higher self-measured blood pressure monitoring frequency (odds ratio = 0.95, 95\% confidence interval, 0.91-0.99, p = 0. 013) than their counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: Home telehealth care combined with care management by public health nurses based in public health care centre was feasible and effective for improving blood pressure control among patients with hypertension. Further studies should conduct a thorough analysis of the cost-effectiveness of this intervention. A randomised controlled trial with a longer follow-up period is required to examine the effects of the improved home telehealth device kit on the care of patients with hypertension.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health helplines are integral to contemporary healthcare, offering fast, low-cost, and geographically unrestricted access to health information and advice. Although some health helplines offer support services (e.g., counselling), many function in ways that are similar to physically co-present (i.e., face-to-face) primary care consultations. However, due to the lack of physical presence, there are differences in the way health consultations are routinely managed on the telephone. This article explores some ways in which healthcare is managed at a distance, on a telephone helpline.
METHODS: Data are 196 recorded calls from the helpline, Healthdirect Australia. Using conversation analysis, this paper compares the delivery of healthcare over the telephone with what is known about physically co-present primary care consultations.
RESULTS: Through an exploration of the overall structure of these helpline calls, we show how Healthdirect Australia calls are organised in terms of eight distinct phases: call opening, establishment of reason-for-calling, check of caller safety, creation of a confidential patient file, medical information-gathering, health advice, caller survey questions, and call closing. We demonstrate how interactants organise their talk around these phases, with a particular focus on the shift between mandated administrative tasks and traditional medical tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that there are systematic differences between the overall structure of health helplines and physically co-present primary care consultations. We demonstrate that the delivery of health information and advice via helplines can be challenging, but that service can be enhanced through continued efforts to inform understanding about how medical encounters routinely unfold in over-the-phone environments.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Few studies have confirmed the cost-saving of telemonitoring of users with pacemakers (PMs). The purpose of this controlled, non-randomised, non-masked clinical trial was to perform an economic assessment of telemonitoring (TM) of users with PMs and check whether TM offers a cost-utility alternative to conventional follow-up in hospital.
METHODS: Eighty-two patients implanted with an internet-based transmission PM were selected to receive either conventional follow-up in hospital ( n = 52) or TM ( n = 30) from their homes. The data were collected during 12 months while patients were being monitored. The economic assessment of the PONIENTE study was performed as per the perspectives of National Health Service (NHS) and patients. A cost-utility analysis was conducted to measure whether the TM of patients with PMs is cost-effective in terms of costs per gained quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
RESULTS: There was a significant cost-saving for participants in the TM group in comparison with the participants in the conventional follow-up group. From the NHS's perspective, the patients in the TM group gained 0.09 QALYs more than the patients in the conventional follow-up group over 12 months, with a cost saving of 57.64\% (€46.51 versus €109.79, respectively; p {\textless} 0.001) per participant per year. In-office visits were reduced by 52.49\% in the TM group. The costs related to the patient perspective were lower in the TM group than in the conventional follow-up group (€31.82 versus €73.48, respectively; p {\textless} 0.005). The costs per QALY were 61.68\% higher in the in-office monitoring group.
DISCUSSION: The cost-utility analysis performed in the PONIENTE study showed that the TM of users with PMs appears to be a significant cost-effective alternative to conventional follow-up in hospital.},

Telemedicine, using cloud-server technology, provides an ideal solution for sharing images performed by non-physicians with cardiologists who are experts in rheumatic heart disease. Objective We describe our experience in using telemedicine to support a large rheumatic heart disease outreach screening programme in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Methods The Programa de Rastreamento da Valvopatia Reumática (PROVAR) is a prospective cross-sectional study aimed at gathering epidemiological data on the burden of rheumatic heart disease in Minas Gerais and testing of a non-expert, telemedicine-supported model of outreach rheumatic heart disease screening. The primary goal is to enable expert support of remote rheumatic heart disease outreach through cloud-based sharing of echocardiographic images between Minas Gerais and Washington. Secondary goals include (a) developing and sharing online training modules for non-physicians in echocardiography performance and interpretation and (b) utilising a secure web-based system to share clinical and research data. Results PROVAR included 4615 studies that were performed by non-experts at 21 schools and shared via cloud-telemedicine technology. Latent rheumatic heart disease was found in 251 subjects (4.2\% of subjects: 3.7\% borderline and 0.5\% definite disease). Of the studies, 50\% were preformed on full functional echocardiography machines and transmitted via Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and 50\% were performed on handheld echocardiography machines and transferred via a secure Dropbox connection. The average time between study performance date and interpretation was 10 days. There was 100\% success in initial image transfer. Less than 1\% of studies performed by non-experts could not be interpreted. Discussion A sustainable, low-cost telehealth model, using task-shifting with non-medical personal in low and middle income countries can improve access to echocardiography for rheumatic heart disease.},

In this review, we evaluate three alternative organizational models that may expand access to high-quality critical care: tiered regionalization, intensive care unit telemedicine, and quality improvement through regional outreach. These models share a potential to increase survival and reduce costs. Yet there are also major barriers to implementation, including the lack of a strong evidence base and the need for significant upfront financial investment. Reorganization of intensive care will also require the support of all involved stakeholders: patients and their families, critical care practitioners, administrative and public health professionals, and policy makers. To varying degrees these models require a central authority to implement and regulate the system, as well as specific legislation, investment in information technology, and financial incentives for providers. The existing evidence does not strongly support exclusive use of a particular model, and creation of a hybrid model that integrates the three complementary approaches is a practical option. A potential framework for implementation involves triage guidelines developed by professional societies leading to demonstration projects and national legislation in support of optimal systems. Additional research is needed to determine the comparative effectiveness and cost implications of these approaches, with a goal of best matching high-quality critical care to patients' needs and professional preferences at the hospital, regional, and national level.},

Screening, surveillance and timely access to specialist ear, nose and throat (ENT) services are key components in detecting and preventing the recurrence of ear diseases. To address the low access and utilisation rate by Indigenous Australians, a collaborative, community-based mobile telemedicine-enabled screening and surveillance (MTESS) service was trialled in Cherbourg, the third largest Indigenous community in Queensland, Australia. This paper aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the MTESS service using a lifetime Markov model that compares two options: (i) the Deadly Ears Program alone (current practice involving an outreach ENT surgical service and screening program), and (ii) the Deadly Ears Program supplemented with the MTESS service. Data were obtained from the Deadly Ears Program, a feasibility study of the MTESS service and the literature. Incremental cost-utility ratios were calculated from a societal perspective with both costs (in 2013-14 Australian dollars) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) discounted at 5\% annually. The model showed that compared with the Deadly Ears Program, the probability of an acceptable cost-utility ratio at a willingness-to-pay threshold of \$50,000/QALY was 98\% for the MTESS service. This cost effectiveness arises from preventing hearing loss in the Indigenous population and the subsequent reduction in associated costs. Deterministic and probability sensitivity analyses indicated that the model was robust to parameter changes. We concluded that the MTESS service is a cost-effective strategy. It presents an opportunity to resolve major issues confronting Australia's health system such as the inequitable provision and access to quality healthcare for rural and remotes communities, and for Indigenous Australians. Additionally, it may encourage effective health service delivery at a time when the healthcare funding and workforce capacity are limited.},

To overcome these challenges of laparoscopy, technology has expanded to include computer-enhanced technology in the form of robotics. Robotic-assisted surgery provides three-dimensional views, intuitive motions, less operator fatigue, tremor filtration facilitating more precise movements, and possesses a shorter learning curve. Robotic-assisted surgery has also paved a pathway to telesurgery and telementoring. This may expand the availability of advanced minimally invasive surgeries throughout the globe.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of a new telemedicine technician-based assessment relative to an existing model of family physician (FP)-based assessment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in Singapore from the health system and societal perspectives.
DESIGN: Model-based, cost-effectiveness analysis of the Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Program (SiDRP).
PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of patients aged 55 years with type 2 diabetes previously not screened for DR.
METHODS: The SiDRP is a new telemedicine-based DR screening program using trained technicians to assess retinal photographs. We compared the cost-effectiveness of SiDRP with the existing model in which FPs assess photographs. We developed a hybrid decision tree/Markov model to simulate the costs, effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SiDRP relative to FP-based DR screening over a lifetime horizon. We estimated the costs from the health system and societal perspectives. Effectiveness was measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Result robustness was calculated using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ICER.
RESULTS: From the societal perspective that takes into account all costs and effects, the telemedicine-based DR screening model had significantly lower costs (total cost savings of S\$173 per person) while generating similar QALYs compared with the physician-based model (i.e., 13.1 QALYs). From the health system perspective that includes only direct medical costs, the cost savings are S\$144 per person. By extrapolating these data to approximately 170 000 patients with diabetes currently being screened yearly for DR in Singapore's primary care polyclinics, the present value of future cost savings associated with the telemedicine-based model is estimated to be S\$29.4 million over a lifetime horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: While generating similar health outcomes, the telemedicine-based DR screening using technicians in the primary care setting saves costs for Singapore compared with the FP model. Our data provide a strong economic rationale to expand the telemedicine-based DR screening program in Singapore and elsewhere.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.05.006},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite evidence of benefits of telehealth networks in increasing access to, or providing, previously unavailable mental health services, care providers still prefer traditional approaches. For psychiatric assessment, digital technology can offer improvements over analog systems for the technical and, subsequently, the social quality of provider-client interaction. This is in turn expected to support greater provider uptake and enhanced patient benefits.
OBJECTIVE: Within the framework of Innovation Diffusion Theory, to study service providers' experiences of an existing regional telehealth network for mental health care practice twelve months after digitisation in order to identify the benefits of digital telehealth over an analog system for mental health care purposes in rural Australia.
METHODS: Qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted with over 40 service providers from June to September 2013 in South Australia, ranging from the metropolitan central operations to health providers located up to 600km away in rural and remote areas of the same state. Participants included rural mental health teams, directors of nursing at rural hospitals, metropolitan-based psychiatrists and registrars, the metropolitan-based mental health team dedicated to rural provider support, rural GPs, administrative staff, and the executive group of the state rural health department. Fieldwork was conducted 12 months after the analog system was digitised. The interview and focus group data were analysed using thematic analysis, focusing on three key areas of innovation diffusion theory: relative advantage, technical complexity and technical compatibility.
RESULTS: Five themes with 11 sub-themes were identified: (1) "Existing Uses", with three sub-themes: current mental health use, use by GPs, and use for staff support; (2) "Relative Advantage", with four sub-themes: improved technical quality, improved clinical practice, time and cost benefits for providers, and improved patient care; (3) "Technical Complexity"; (4) "Technical Compatibility" with two sub-themes: technical-clinical and technical-administrative; and (5) "Broader Organisational Culture", with two sub-themes: organizational policy support and 'digital telehealth' culture.
CONCLUSIONS: The digitised telehealth network was generally well received by providers and adopted into clinical practice. Compared with the previous analog system, staff found advantages in better visual and audio quality, more technical stability with less "drop-out", less time delay to conversations and less confusion for clients. Despite these advantages, providers identified a range of challenges to starting or continuing use and they recommended improvements to increase uptake among mental health service providers and other providers (including GPs), and to clinical uses other than mental health. To further increase uptake and impact of telehealth-mediated mental health care in rural and remote areas, even with a high quality digital system, future research must design innovative care models, consider time and cost incentives for providers to use telehealth, and must focus not only on technical training but also how to best integrate technology with clinical practice and must develop an organization-wide digital telehealth culture.},

The direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV are highly effective, with a low burden of side effects. Since 2016, DAAs are available to all Australians with HCV. However, currently in Australia, they can only be prescribed by or in consultation with experienced prescribers. This study evaluated a telementoring service to upskill doctors and nurse practitioners working in correctional facilities. Methods The telementoring service was implemented in five correctional facilities. Qualitative interviews were used to examine the perceived clinical effectiveness and organisational impacts of the service. Content analysis of the interviews was used to identify key themes. Results In the first ten months of the service, there were 16 telementoring sessions with 173 patients discussed. Sixteen staff participated in qualitative interviews. From these, three key themes were identified: access to antiviral therapy; organisational impacts (cost, increased staff knowledge and confidence, staff time, and workload); and, adaptations of the care model and future opportunities. Conclusion Telementoring is an effective method to facilitate eligible prescriber status to medical doctors and upskill other clinicians in correctional facilities to increase capacity to treat HCV.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medicare has been one of the principal payers for healthcare services delivered via telemedicine to rural beneficiaries since 1997. Early projections of the cost of covering telemedicine for Medicare beneficiaries made legislators cautious to take on such a large obligation, but subsequent reports showed actual expenditures to be far below early estimates. As interest in expanding Medicare's coverage for services delivered via telemedicine grows, further examination of the extent of telemedicine use within the Medicare program and the costs associated with this use is warranted.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medicare claims data from 2012 were examined. All valid claims associated with a Current Procedural Terminology code and modifier indicative of delivery via telemedicine were extracted and linked to the state of origin using carrier codes. Claims were summarized by clinical procedure code, medical specialty, and state. Expenditures were also calculated on a per member per month basis by state to compare the relative penetration of telemedicine among states.
RESULTS: Total Medicare telemedicine-related expenditures in 2012 were found to be a little over \$5 million, 65.2\% of the total allowed telemedicine-related charges of \$7.7 million. This figure represents an expenditure of approximately \$0.09 annually per Medicare enrollee, or about three-quarters of a penny per member per month. Wide variation was found among states in telemedicine use. Mental health services and service providers accounted for nearly 70\% of total telemedicine-related professional fees, and originating site facility fee claims accounted for only 28\% of the total number of paid claims.
CONCLUSIONS: Medicare spending on telemedicine is largely for mental health services and represents only a tiny fraction of overall Medicare spending. Adoption of telehealth is driven by multiple factors beyond need and rurality.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Telemedicine has demonstrated potential to improve access and quality of mental health services in underserved areas. Use of telemedicine to deliver health services may enable a range of synergistic innovations in care practices, but such innovations will require rigorous evaluation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated a telemental health program designed to increase access by eliminating clinician travel time in a multisite rural community mental health center. The program included both traditionally scheduled and "open scheduled" clinics provided via telemedicine. An initial 13-month evaluation showed better access, quality, and sustainability compared with similar services delivered using traditional methods available elsewhere within the organization. A 24-month follow-up analysis was undertaken to determine if initial findings remained consistent.
RESULTS: Telemedicine clinics continued to show remarkably consistent advantages in both access and quality compared with traditional services. Cost-efficiency gains were also robust, maintaining a 20-percentage-point advantage in conversion of scheduled time to billable time over traditional clinics. Much of this advantage was attributable to the 20\% of clinic volume that was open-scheduled or "walk-in" in nature.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms earlier findings that telemedicine technology can support synergistic innovations in service format (such as "open scheduling") and maintain measurable advantages in access and quality along with cost-efficiencies past the initial implementation period.},

The electrochemical methods that we demonstrate enable quantitative, broadly applicable, and inexpensive sensing with flexibility based on a wide variety of important electroanalytical techniques (chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, square wave voltammetry, and potentiometry), each with different uses. Four applications demonstrate the analytical performance of the device: these involve the detection of (i) glucose in the blood for personal health, (ii) trace heavy metals (lead, cadmium, and zinc) in water for in-field environmental monitoring, (iii) sodium in urine for clinical analysis, and (iv) a malarial antigen (Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2) for clinical research. The combination of these electrochemical capabilities in an affordable, handheld format that is compatible with any mobile phone or network worldwide guarantees that sophisticated diagnostic testing can be performed by users with a broad spectrum of needs, resources, and levels of technical expertise.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of telestroke--a 2-way, audiovisual technology that links stroke specialists to remote emergency department physicians and their stroke patients--compared to usual care (i.e., remote emergency departments without telestroke consultation or stroke experts).
METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed for both 90-day and lifetime horizons. Model inputs were taken from published literature where available and supplemented with western states' telestroke experiences. Costs were gathered using a societal perspective and converted to 2008 US dollars. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were combined with costs to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). In the lifetime horizon model, both costs and QALYs were discounted at 3\% annually. Both one-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were performed.
RESULTS: In the base case analysis, compared to usual care, telestroke results in an ICER of \$108,363/QALY in the 90-day horizon and \$2,449/QALY in the lifetime horizon. For the 90-day and lifetime horizons, 37.5\% and 99.7\% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations yielded ICERs {\textless}\$50,000/QALY, a ratio commonly considered acceptable in the United States.
CONCLUSION: When a lifetime perspective is taken, telestroke appears cost-effective compared to usual care, since telestroke costs are upfront but benefits of improved stroke care are lifelong. If barriers to use such as low reimbursement rates and high equipment costs are reduced, telestroke has the potential to diminish the striking geographic disparities of acute stroke care in the United States.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Using real-world data from the Providence Oregon Telestroke Network, we examined the cost-effectiveness of telestroke from both the spoke and hub perspectives by level of financial responsibility for these costs and by patient stroke severity.
METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model using patient-level clinical and financial data from before and after telestroke implementation. Effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and was combined with cost per patient outcomes to calculate incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Outcomes were generated (a) overall; (b) by stroke severity, via the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at time of arrival, defined as low ({\textless}5), medium (5-14) and high ({\textgreater}15); and (c) by percentage of implementation costs paid by spokes (0\%, 50\%, 100\%).
RESULTS: Data for 864 patients, 98 pre- and 766 post-implementation, were used to parameterize our model. From the spoke perspective, telestroke had ICERs of US\$1322/QALY, US\$25,991/QALY and US\$50,687/QALY when responsible for 0\%, 50\%, and 100\% of these costs, respectively. Overall, the ICER ranged from US\$22,363/QALY to US\$71,703/QALY from the hub perspective.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support previous models showing good value, overall. However, costs and ICERs varied by stroke severity, with telestroke being most cost-effective for severe strokes. Telestroke was least cost effective for the spokes if spokes paid for more than half of implementation costs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Access to quality hypertension care is often poor in sub-Saharan Africa. Some community pharmacies offer hypertension monitoring services, with and without involvement of medical doctors. To directly connect pharmacy staff and cardiologists a care model including a mobile application (mHealth) for remote patient monitoring was implemented and pilot tested in Lagos, Nigeria. Pharmacists provided blood pressure measurements and counselling. Cardiologists enrolled patients in the pilot program and remotely monitored them, for which patients paid a monthly fee. We evaluated the feasibility of this care model at five private community pharmacies. Outcome measures were retention in care, blood pressure change, quality of care, and patients' and healthcare providers' satisfaction with the care model.
METHODS: Patients participated in the care model's pilot at one of the five pharmacies for approximately 6-8 months from February 2016. We conducted structured patient interviews and blood pressure measurements at pilot entry and exit, and used exports of the mHealth-application, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with patients, pharmacists and cardiologists.
RESULTS: Of 336 enrolled patients, 236 (72\%) were interviewed at pilot entry and exit. According to the mHealth data 71\% returned to the pharmacy after enrollment, with 3.3 months (IQR: 2.2-5.4) median duration of activity in the mHealth-application. Patients self-reported more visits than recorded in the mHealth data. Pharmacists mentioned use of paper records, understaffing, the application not being user-friendly, and patients' unwillingness to pay as reasons for underreporting. Mean systolic blood pressure decreased 9.9 mmHg (SD: 18). Blood pressure on target increased from 24 to 56\% and an additional 10\% had an improved blood pressure at endline, however this was not associated with duration of mHealth activity. Patients were satisfied because of accessibility, attention, adherence and information provision.
CONCLUSION: Patients, pharmacists and cardiologists adopted the care model, albeit with gaps in mHealth data. Most patients were satisfied, and their mean blood pressure significantly reduced. Usage of the mHealth application, pharmacy incentives, and a modified financing model are opportunities for improvement. In addition, costs of implementation and availability of involved healthcare providers need to be investigated before such a care model can be further implemented.},

However, the ever-increasing costs of looking after an aging population, many of whom suffer chronic diseases, is straining the finances of healthcare systems around Europe. This situation has given rise to a great deal of attention being paid to the development of telerehabilitation (TR) systems, which have been designed to take rehabilitation beyond hospitals and care centers. In this article, we propose which features should be addressed in the development of TR systems, that is, they should consider adaptive, multisensorial, physiological and social aspects. For this aim, the research project Vi-SMARt is being conducted for evaluating whether and how different technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), multi-sensorial feedback, or telemonitoring, may be exploited for the development of the next generation of TR systems. Beyond traditional aural and visual feedback, the exploitation of haptic sense by using devices such as haptic gloves or wristbands, can provide patients with additional guidance in the rehabilitation process. For telemonitoring, Electroencephalography (EEG) devices show signs of being a promising approach, not only to monitor patients' emotions, but also to obtain neuro-feedback useful for controlling his/her interaction with the system and thus to provide a better rehabilitation experience.},

The purpose of this paper is to (a) examine the rates of avoided transfers in rural emergency departments that adopted tele-emergency applications; and (b) estimate the costs and benefits of using tele-emergency to avoid transfers. Methods Analysis is based on 9048 tele-emergency encounters generated by the Avera eEmergency programme (Sioux Falls, South Dakota) in 85 rural hospitals across seven states between October 2009-February 2014. For each non-transfer patient, physicians indicated whether the transfer was avoided because of tele-emergency activation. The cost-benefit analysis is conducted from the hospital, patient and societal perspectives, and includes technology costs, local hospital revenues and patient-associated savings. All monetary values are expressed in US\$. Sensitivity analysis is conducted by examining the worst and best case scenarios of costs, revenues and savings. Results In these analyses, 1175 avoided transfers were attributed to tele-emergency. From a rural hospital perspective, tele-emergency costs around US\$1739 to avoid a single transfer. However, tele-emergency saves around US\$5563 in avoided transportation and indirect patient costs. Combining these, from a societal perspective, tele-emergency has the potential to result in a net savings of US\$3823 per avoided transfer while accounting for tele-emergency technology costs, hospital revenues, and patient-associated savings. Conclusion This study highlights various stakeholder perspectives on the financial impact of tele-emergency in avoiding patient transfers in rural emergency departments. Telemedicine has the potential to reduce the number of transfers of emergency department patients and generate some revenue for rural hospitals despite associated technology costs, while incurring substantial patient savings.},

METHODS: Individuals treated via telepsychiatry were compared with a matched control group of individuals with mental health diagnoses who were treated in nonparticipating hospitals. Bivariate and two-part and generalized linear regression models were used to assess differences between the two groups in outpatient follow-up, hospital admission following the ED visit, length of hospital stay if admitted, and inpatient and total costs.
RESULTS: Between March 2009 and June 2013, there were 9,066 patients with at least one telepsychiatry visit. Of these, 7,261 had index telepsychiatry visits that the authors were able to successfully match. Compared with the matched control group, telepsychiatry recipients were more likely to receive 30-day outpatient follow-up (46\% versus 16\%, p{\textless}.001) and 90-day outpatient follow-up (54\% versus 20\%, p{\textless}.001). Telepsychiatry recipients were less likely than the control group to be admitted to the hospital during the index ED visit (11\% versus 22\%, p{\textless}.001). The combined effect of having a telepsychiatry consult during the index ED visit was a reduction of .86 days in inpatient length of stay. Thirty-day inpatient costs were \$2,336 (p=.04) lower for the telepsychiatry versus the control group, but 30-day total health care costs were not statistically different.
CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychiatry delivered in the ED through a centralized coordinated program has great promise for improving linkage with outpatient mental health services while reducing inpatient utilization and hospital costs.},

In a first study with healthy subjects, the mean value of the respiratory rate error, the standard deviation of the error and the correlation coefficient were 0.01 breaths per minute (bpm), 0.97 bpm and 0.995 (p {\textless} 0.00001), respectively. In a second study with COPD patients, the values were \&minus;0.14 bpm, 0.28 bpm and 0.9988 (p {\textless} 0.0000001), respectively. The results for the rest period show the technical and functional feasibility of the prototype and serve as a preliminary validation of the device for respiratory rate monitoring of patients with COPD.},

Technological advances and the need to reduce health service costs will strongly promote the development of telemedicine. For this reason, we evaluated the concordance between store-and-forward mobile teledermatology and the classical face-to-face dermatological visit. We also measured the time taken to submit a teleconsultation using a smartphone. Before conventional face-to-face visit, a final-year resident of the three-year course for general practitioners collected medical history, took digital images of skin diseases with a smartphone and, measuring the time required to complete this operation, transmitted them to an expert teledermatologist. In 391 patients we obtained a concordance between face-to-face and store-and-forward diagnosis of 91.05\% (Cohen κ coefficient = 0.906). On average only few minutes needs to be added to a normal visit to transmit the cases to an expert teledermatologist.},

	abstract = {A survey of recent worldwide trends in Universal Service Funds (USFs) and the assistance provided for their application indicates that industrialized countries and developing nations alike have offered or plan to offer tax-relief measures or reimbursement for communications costs incurred by telemedicine programs, thus finding a way to actively apply USFs in rural areas. There are three main systems used to calculate the amount of reimbursement from a USF. While many countries adopt a service-area net-loss estimation method, Japan uses a benchmark method and provides financial assistance only to unprofitable areas. The USA has proactively introduced telemedicine to rural areas and isolated islands in order to minimize rapidly rising healthcare costs and to improve the efficiency of healthcare services. In the USA, the USF is used to pay back communications costs incurred through telemedicine programs. For instance, the budget allocated from the USF for reimbursements for telemedicine in Alaska reached USD 30 Mil. in 2007. Developing countries in Africa and Asia are operating various forms of telemedicine on a trial basis, but a tax-relief measure or payback of communications costs, which are a large portion of the running costs, will need to be implemented to ensure sustainable and autonomous operation of telemedicine. In Japan, up until January 2007, the USF system assumed the use of an NTS (non-traffic sensitive cost) system to obtain funds from connection fees, and this system would receive funds from each telecommunications carrier (payer: the telecommunications carriers). The beneficiaries would be limited to two companies, namely NTT East and NTT West. However, the Japanese USF system was revised in February 2007, and a fee is now collected from each telephone number (payer: the user). The collected funds are used to cover losses in unprofitable areas (not limited to remote areas) among 7,000 business areas in Japan. In view of worldwide trends, the author believes that Japan should also start using the USF system to reimburse communications costs (including costs of telemedicine) in order to achieve sustainable and autonomous operation of public communication systems in rural areas.},

Therefore, the system of the remote diagnosis for frozen section has been standing up in this country for 7 years. In Japan, the USF has started from February 2007 to support only telecommunications operator's hardware (NTT's equipment such as digital switch board) in high cost areas, not for the reimbursement of the tariff of the public users, such as telepathology. To solve such social cormorant equality, when the USF and PAs were supported in the present quick frozen intraoperative telepathology diagnosis, the quality of the cancer treatment in rural area will be improved. Based on the past data of the Japanese telepathology with beta distribution function, it can be estimated that user terminals becomes five times more than present users with support of USF and PAs. Moreover, using VPN on the B'FLETS, the effect of other teleconsultations will spread to the nationwide.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The feasibility of telemedicine in diagnosing and treating nonacute headaches, such as primary headaches (migraine and tension-type) and medication-overuse headaches has not been previously investigated. By eliminating the need of travel to specialists, telemedicine may offer significant time and money savings.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to estimate the acceptance of telemedicine and investigate the feasibility and cost savings of telemedicine consultations in diagnosing and treating nonacute headaches.
METHODS: From September 2012 to March 2015, nonacute headache patients from Northern Norway who were referred to neurologists through an electronic application system were consecutively screened and randomized to participate in either telemedicine or traditional specialist visits. All patients were consulted by two neurologists at the neurological department in Tromsø University Hospital. Feasibility outcomes were compared between telemedicine and traditional groups. Baseline characteristics and costs were then compared between rural and urban patients. Travel costs were calculated by using the probabilistic method of the Norwegian traveling agency: the cheapest means of public transport for each study participant. Loss of pay was calculated based on the Norwegian full-time employee's average salary: {\textless} 3.5 hours=a half day's salary, {\textgreater} 3.5 hours spent on travel and consultation=one day's salary. Distance and time spent on travel were estimated by using Google Maps.
RESULTS: Of 557 headache patients screened, 479 were found eligible and 402 accepted telemedicine participation (83.9\%, 402/479) and were included in the final analyses. Of these, 202 received traditional specialist consultations and 200 received telemedicine. All patients in the telemedicine group were satisfied with the video quality, and 198 (99\%, 198/200) were satisfied with the sound quality. The baseline characteristics as well as headache diagnostics and follow-up appointments, and the investigation, advice, and prescription practices were not statistically different between the two randomized groups. In addition, telemedicine consultations were shorter than traditional visits (38.8 vs 43.7 min, P{\textless}.001). The travel cost per rural individual (292/402, 73\%) was €249, and estimated lost income was €234 per visit. The travel cost in the urban area (110/402, 27\%) was €6, and estimated lost income was €117 per visit. The median traveling distance for rural patients was 526 km (range 1892 km), and the median traveling time was 7.8 hours (range 27.3 hours). Rural patients had a longer waiting time than urban patients (64 vs 47 days, P=.001), and fewer women were referred from rural areas (P=.04). Rural women reported higher pain scores than urban women (P=.005).
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that telemedicine is an accepted, feasible, time-saving, and cost-saving alternative to traditional specialist consultations for nonacute headaches.

In the past few years, controlled randomised studies have shown that patients with chronic heart failure benefit from telemedical monitoring; specifically, telemonitoring of various vital parameters combined with a review of the symptoms, drug compliance and patient education. In Germany, various telemedical monitoring projects for patients with chronic heart failure have been initiated in the past few years; seven of them are presented here. Currently 7220 patients are being monitored in the seven selected projects. Most patients (51.1\%) are in NYHA stage II, 26.3\% in NYHA stage III, 14.5\% in NYHA stage I and only 6.6\% in NYHA stage IV respectively. Most projects are primarily regional. Their structure of telemedical monitoring tends to be modular and uses stratification according to the NYHA stages. All projects include medical or health economics assessments. The future of telemedical monitoring projects for patients with chronic heart failure will depend on the outcome of these assessments. Only of there is statistical evidence for medical benefit to the individual patient as well as cost savings will these projects continue.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In rural America cigarette smoking is prevalent, few cessation services are available, and healthcare providers lack the time and resources to help smokers quit. This paper describes the design and participant characteristics of Connect2Quit (C2Q), a randomized control trial (RCT) that tests the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of integrated telemedicine counseling delivered by 2-way webcams mounted on desktop computers in participant's physician office examining rooms (ITM) versus quitline counseling delivered by telephone in participant's homes (Phone) for helping rural smokers quit.
METHODS/DESIGN: C2Q was implemented in twenty primary care and safety net clinics. Integrated telemedicine consisted of real-time video counseling, delivered to patients in their primary care physician's (PCP) office. Phone counseling, was delivered to patients in their homes. All participants received educational materials and guidance in selecting cessation medications.
RESULTS: The 566 participants were predominantly Caucasian (92\%); 9\% were Latino. Most (65\%) earned {\textless}200\% of Federal Poverty Level. One out of three lacked home internet access, 40\% were not comfortable using computers, and only 4\% had been seen by a doctor via telemedicine in the past. Hypertension, chronic lung disease, and diabetes were highly prevalent. Participants smoked nearly a pack a day and were highly motivated to quit.
DISCUSSION: C2Q is reaching a rural low-income population, with comorbid chronic diseases, that would benefit greatly from quitting smoking. ITM is a good delivery model, which integrates care by holding counseling sessions in the patient's PCP office and keeps the primary care team updated on patients' progress.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Battery longevity is an important factor that may influence the selection of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). However, there remains a lack of industry-wide standardized reporting of predicted CIED longevity to facilitate informed decision-making for implanting physicians and payers.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the predicted longevity of current generation CIEDs using best-matched CIEDs settings to assess differences between brands and models.
METHODS: Data were extracted for current model pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), and cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillators (CRT-Ds) from product manuals and, where absent, by communication with the manufacturers. Pacemaker longevity estimations were based on standardized pacing outputs (2.5V, 0.40-ms pulse width, 500-Ω impedance) and pacing loads of 50\% or 100\% at 60 bpm. ICD and CRT-D longevity were estimated at 0\% pacing and 15\% atrial plus 100\% biventricular pacing, with essential capacitor reforms and zero clinical shocks.
RESULTS: Mean maximum predicted longevity of single- and dual-chamber pacemakers was 12.0 ± 2.1 and 9.8 ± 1.9 years, respectively. Use of advanced features such as remote monitoring, prearrhythmia electrogram storage, and rate response can result in ∼1.4 years of reduction in longevity. Mean maximum predicted longevity of ICDs and CRT-Ds was 12.4 ± 3.0 and 8.8 ± 2.1 years, respectively. Of note, there were significant variations in predicted CIED longevity according to device manufacturers, with up to 44\%, 42\%, and 44\% difference for pacemakers, ICDs, and CRT-Ds, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Contemporary CIEDs demonstrate highly variable predicted longevity according to device manufacturers. This may impact on health care costs and long-term clinical outcomes.},

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the initial efficacy and user acceptability of a theory-driven mobile app to increase vegetable consumption.
METHODS: A total of 17 overweight adults aged 42.0 (SD 7.3) years with a body mass index (BMI) of 32.0 (SD 3.5) kg/m(2) were randomized to the use of Vegethon (a fully automated theory-driven mobile app enabling self-monitoring of vegetable consumption, goal setting, feedback, and social comparison) or a wait-listed control condition. All participants were recruited from an ongoing 12-month weight loss trial (parent trial). Researchers who performed data analysis were blinded to condition assignment. The primary outcome measure was daily vegetable consumption, assessed using an adapted version of the validated Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire administered at baseline and 12 weeks after randomization. An analysis of covariance was used to assess differences in 12-week vegetable consumption between intervention and control conditions, controlling for baseline. App usability and satisfaction were measured via a 21-item post-intervention questionnaire.
RESULTS: Using intention-to-treat analyses, all enrolled participants (intervention: 8; control: 9) were analyzed. Of the 8 participants randomized to the intervention, 5 downloaded the app and logged their vegetable consumption a mean of 0.7 (SD 0.9) times per day, 2 downloaded the app but did not use it, and 1 never downloaded it. Consumption of vegetables was significantly greater among the intervention versus control condition at the end of the 12-week pilot study (adjusted mean difference: 7.4 servings; 95\% CI 1.4-13.5; P=.02). Among secondary outcomes defined a priori, there was significantly greater consumption of green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and dark yellow vegetables (adjusted mean difference: 2.6, 1.6, and 0.8 servings; 95\% CI 0.1-5.0, 0.1-3.2, and 0.3-1.4; P=.04, P=.04, and P=.004, respectively). Participants reported positive experiences with the app, including strong agreement with the statements "I have found Vegethon easy to use" and "I would recommend Vegethon to a friend" (mean 4.6 (SD 0.6) and 4.2 (SD 0.8), respectively, (on a 5-point scale).
CONCLUSIONS: Vegethon demonstrated initial efficacy and user acceptability. A mobile app intervention may be useful for increasing vegetable consumption among overweight adults. The small sample size prevented precise estimates of effect sizes. Given the improved health outcomes associated with increases in vegetable consumption, these findings indicate the need for larger, longer-term evaluations of Vegethon and similar technologies among overweight adults and other suitable target groups.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of any remote healthcare monitoring system depends on how much accurate, patient-friendly, versatile, and cost-effective measurement it is delivering. There has always been a huge demand for such a long-term noninvasive remote blood pressure (BP) measurement system, which could be used worldwide in the remote healthcare industry. Thus, noninvasive continuous BP measurement and remote monitoring have become an emerging area in the remote healthcare industry.
INTRODUCTION: Photoplethysmography-based (PPG) BP measurement is a continuous, unobtrusive, patient-friendly, and cost-effective solution. However, BP measurements through PPG sensors are not much reliable and accurate due to some major limitations like pressure disturbance, motion artifacts, and variations in human skin tone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A novel reflective PPG sensor has been developed to eliminate the abovementioned pressure disturbance and motion artifacts during the BP measurement. Considering the variations of the human skin tone across demography, a novel algorithm has been developed to make the BP measurement accurate and reliable. The training dataset captured 186 subjects' data and the trial dataset captured another new 102 subjects' data.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The overall accuracy achieved by using the proposed method is nearly 98\%. Thus, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method.
CONCLUSIONS: The developed BP monitoring system is quite accurate, reliable, cost-effective, handy, and user friendly. It is also expected that this system would be quite useful to monitor the BP of infants, elderly people, patients having wounds, burn injury, or in the intensive care unit environment.},

OBJECTIVE: This article aims to explore the use and potential of store-and-forward teledermatology in the Australian context.
DISCUSSION: Doctors who use this service can manage the majority of their patients without the need for a face-to-face appointment with a specialist dermatologist and deliver similar outcomes. Using store-and-forward technology rather than videoconferencing, this site provides specialist diagnosis and management advice year round. All cases are answered within 24 hours of being submitted. There are benefits in terms of increased availability, as well as reduced time, cost and professional isolation. However, uptake remains low, potentially because of a lack of awareness, increased workload for referring practitioners and lack of financial incentives.},

OBJECTIVES: The willingness to use telemonitoring is examined for both physicians and patients. From the perspective of the most important stakeholders, advantages and disadvantages as well as barriers for telemonitoring are analysed.
METHODS: A Telehealth Readiness Assessment was carried out with physicians (n = 41) and patients (n = 47) in a cross-sectional study. A stakeholder survey was conducted by use of interviews (n = 28).
RESULTS: Average readiness for telemonitoring is 58\% for physicians, and 65\% for patients. Both are thus in a position where there are several arguments which adversely affect the success of telemonitoring. The most important advantage is the intensified care, while the biggest concerns are data protection as well as the loss of personal communication. The greatest barriers are the lack of funding, the weak clinical and economic evidence and the organisation of the Austrian healthcare system.
CONCLUSION: There are still some barriers to overcome, especially financial, political and organisational.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Major depressive disorder causes more human suffering than any other disease affecting humankind. It has a high prevalence and it is predicted that it will be among the three leading causes of disease burden by 2030. The prevalence of depression, all of its social and personal costs, and its recurrent characteristics, put heavy constraints on the ability of the public healthcare system to provide sufficient support for patients with depression. In this research, a model for continuous monitoring and tracking of depression in both short-term and long-term periods is presented. This model is based on a new qualitative reasoning approach.
METHOD: This paper describes the patient assessment unit of a major depression monitoring system that has three modules: a patient progress module, based on a qualitative reasoning model; an analysis module, based on expert knowledge and a rules-based system; and the communication module. These modules base their reasoning mainly on data of the patient's mood and life events that are obtained from the patient's responses to specific questionnaires (PHQ-9, M.I.N.I. and Brugha). The patient assessment unit provides synthetic and useful information for both patients and physicians, keeps them informed of the progress of patients, and alerts them in the case of necessity.
RESULTS: A set of hypothetical patients has been defined based on clinically possible cases in order to perform a complete scenario evaluation. The results that have been verified by psychiatrists suggest the utility of the platform.
CONCLUSION: The proposed major depression monitoring system takes advantage of current technologies and facilitates more frequent follow-up of the progress of patients during their home stay after being diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Training in cardiovascular MR (CMR) is an important topic in times of growing acceptance of the method for accurate diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. However, off-site training is becoming less acceptable with increasing cost and time pressures. We introduce a novel CMR network, capable of providing, remotely, part of CMR training and continuous expert support. By providing a technical and operational blueprint, we want to share our experience in building teaching networks.
METHODS: Conceptual, technical, and content-related characteristics of our teaching methods are introduced. A total of 97 participants in traditional fellowship CMR teaching and novel module-based network teaching were surveyed to assess their CMR performance.
RESULTS: The number of hospitals in our CMR network increased from five in 2009 to 14 in 2014. A total of 79\% of network hospitals conducted {\textgreater}100 CMR scans annually. Among these network hospitals are four small institutions ({\textless}400 beds), and five medium-sized hospitals (400-1,000 beds). Network teaching reduced off-site training to only five weeks. The time to the first independently conducted CMR scans was one week, with network teaching, but {\textgreater}1 month for 32\% of participants in traditional CMR teaching. The CMR network enables experts from distant locations to supervise and control CMR scans in a distant hospital, in real time.
CONCLUSIONS: CMR networks provide an efficient teaching platform with a minimum of off-site time for trainees. Real-time remote supervision and scan control capabilities support the decentralization of CMR expertise and enables even small and rurally located institutions to offer high-quality CMR scans.},

	abstract = {Despite the rapid progress in optical imaging, most of the advanced microscopy modalities still require complex and costly set-ups that unfortunately limit their use beyond well equipped laboratories. In the meantime, microscopy in resource-limited settings has requirements significantly different from those encountered in advanced laboratories, and such imaging devices should be cost-effective, compact, light-weight and appropriately accurate and simple to be usable by minimally trained personnel. Furthermore, these portable microscopes should ideally be digitally integrated as part of a telemedicine network that connects various mobile health-care providers to a central laboratory or hospital. Toward this end, here we demonstrate a lensless on-chip microscope weighing approximately 46 grams with dimensions smaller than 4.2 cm x 4.2 cm x 5.8 cm that achieves sub-cellular resolution over a large field of view of approximately 24 mm(2). This compact and light-weight microscope is based on digital in-line holography and does not need any lenses, bulky optical/mechanical components or coherent sources such as lasers. Instead, it utilizes a simple light-emitting-diode (LED) and a compact opto-electronic sensor-array to record lensless holograms of the objects, which then permits rapid digital reconstruction of regular transmission or differential interference contrast (DIC) images of the objects. Because this lensless incoherent holographic microscope has orders-of-magnitude improved light collection efficiency and is very robust to mechanical misalignments it may offer a cost-effective tool especially for telemedicine applications involving various global health problems in resource limited settings.},

	abstract = {For the first six weeks following total knee arthroplasty (TKA), a patient will attend an outpatient clinic typically seen twice weekly. Here, an exercise regime is performed and improvement assessed using a hand held goniometer that measures the maximum angle of knee flexion, an important metric of progress. Additionally a series of daily exercises is performed at home, recorded in a diary. This protocol has problems. Patients must attend the hospital with assistance since they are not permitted to drive for six weeks following the procedure; appointments are sometimes missed; there are occasionally not enough physiotherapy appointment available; furthermore, it is difficult to be sure that patients are compliant with their exercises at home. The economic and social costs are therefore significant both to the patient and the health service. We describe here an automatic system that performs the monitoring of knee flexion within a domestic environment rather than in a hospital setting. It comprises a master and slave sensor unit that attach using Velcro straps to the thigh and shin above and below the operation wound. The patient performs the prescribed knee exercises whilst wearing the device, during which time it measures and records the angles of knee flexion. The device utilises the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) infrastructure to transmit data through the Internet to a secure hospital-based server using an on-board GSM modem. The clinician is then able to view and interpret the information from any computer with internet access and the software. The system does not require the patient to possess a mobile telephone, a computer, or have internet access; the necessary communications technology is completely integrated into the device.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: To enhance the quality of neurosurgery consultations, triage, and transport decisions between a Level I trauma service neurosurgery program at the University of New Mexico Hospital and referring hospitals, a secure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant Web-based system was developed, to which digital neurological images could be sent for review by a neurosurgeon for consultation or patient transfer. Based upon prior experience of neurosurgery, it was predicted that 25\% of transfer requests would be avoided if the neurosurgeons reviewed the computerized tomography scans at the time of a transfer request. In addition, it was predicted in 25\% of the case that changes in management recommendations would take place independent of the transfer decision.
METHODS: The program was designed to allow referring hospitals to transmit digital images to the Web site, providing consulting doctors with additional patient information. This project analyzed the neurosurgeons' responses to questions designed to determine if transport or management decisions were altered when using this telehealth program in response to a request for consultation or transfer from a rural facility.
RESULTS: Analysis of the responses of the consulting neurosurgeons revealed that, after viewing the images, 44\% of the potential transfers were avoided and 44\% of consulted cases resulted in management recommendation changes independent of the transfer decision.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of the system resulted in improved triage and changes in transfer or management recommendations. A significant number of potential transfers were avoided, resulting in transport cost avoidance, more effective use of resources, and more appropriate use of the neurosurgery service as well as improved patient preparation.},

Telehealth technology to monitor patients, especially those in geographically isolated areas, may reduce post-operative complications and improve health and financial outcomes. The primary objective of this study was to compare outcomes between patients who received TeleHealth Electronic Monitoring (THEM) and those with routine discharge instructions and no monitoring, Standard Of Care (SOC).
METHODS: This is a prospective randomized study of vascular surgery patients with infrainguinal incisions. THEM patients received a tablet and home monitoring devices that transmitted information to care managers. Monitoring tools included image capture, weight scales, blood pressure cuffs, thermometers, and oxygen saturation monitors. Care managers used the TeleMed 2020 Enform™ platform to review alerts, real-time patient data, and dialogue with the care team.
RESULTS: Eighty patients were screened and 30 enrolled, of which 16 (53.3\%) were randomized to the THEM group and 14 (46.7\%) to the control group. Average age and body mass index for THEM and control patients were similar (62.5 ± 7.2 vs. 65.7 ± 7.3, P = 0.234; and 27.7 ± 4.3 vs. 29.1 7.1, P = 0.487), respectively. There was a similar number of male participants in each group (THEM 62.5\% vs. SOC 42.9\%, P = 0.464). There were no significant differences in wound or 30-day readmissions (THEM 6.3\% vs. SOC 7.1\%, P = 1.000). Interestingly, 30-day infection rates indicated that care managers identified marginally more superficial wound problems in the THEM group (31.3\% vs. 7.1\%, P = 0.175). Both groups reported an increase in short-form-8 physical summary scores, but was more pronounced in THEM patients (P = 0.076). THEM patients reported a significantly greater improvement in quality of life on 3 of the short-form-8 quality subscales (physical function, role-physical, and role-emotional; THEM delta 7.5 versus Control delta 1.1; THEM delta 8.7 versus Control delta 1.1; and THEM delta 6.3 versus Control delta -0.5; all P {\textless} 0.05). THEM patients reported trends for higher satisfaction in terms of general satisfaction, technical quality, and accessibility for Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-18 survey questions (4.2 vs. 3.7, P = 0.072; 4.5 vs. 4.1, P = 0.081; and 4.2 vs. 3.8, P = 0.063), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: THEM was technically feasible and provided some benefit to patients in geographically disparate areas. THEM was associated with increased patient satisfaction. Additional findings suggested that THEM patients embraced telehealth technology and took advantage of increased access to healthcare professionals. Telehealth successfully merged remotely generated information with care manager interaction. Presently, a larger study, preferably multi-center, is warranted and under consideration.},

It is also easy to make the connection that many post-hospital discharge surgical complications, including surgical site infections (SSIs), could be influenced or exacerbated by patient comorbidities. The authors of a recent study reported that female gender, obesity, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, and neurologic disease were significant predictors of SSIs after vascular reconstruction was performed. The main concern for optimal patient care, especially in geographically isolated areas of West Virginia, is to have early, expeditious, and prompt diagnosis of complications and SSI. This adjunct to existing approaches could lead to improved outcomes and patient satisfaction, minimizing third-party interventions and decreasing the total cost of care. It seems reasonable to believe that monitoring using telehealth technology and managing the general health care of patients after a hospital vascular intervention will improve overall health and reduce 30-day readmissions and SSIs.},

The 4-year Syrian conflict has destroyed hospitals and severely reduced the capacity of intensive care units (ICUs) and on-site intensivists. The crisis has triggered attempts from abroad to support the medical care of severely injured and acutely ill civilians inside Syria, including application of telemedicine. Within the United States, tele-ICU programs have been operating for more than a decade, albeit with high start-up costs and generally long development times. With the benefit of lessons drawn from those domestic models, the Syria Tele-ICU program was launched in December 2012 to manage the care of ICU patients in parts of Syria by using inexpensive, off-the-shelf video cameras, free social media applications, and a volunteer network of Arabic-speaking intensivists in North America and Europe. Within 1 year, 90 patients per month in three ICUs were receiving tele-ICU services. At the end of 2015, a network of approximately 20 participating intensivists was providing clinical decision support 24 hours per day to five civilian ICUs in Syria. The volunteer clinicians manage patients at a distance of more than 6,000 miles, separated by seven or eight time zones between North America and Syria. The program is implementing a cloud-based electronic medical record for physician documentation and a medication administration record for nurses. There are virtual chat rooms for patient rounds, radiology review, and trainee teaching. The early success of the program shows how a small number of committed physicians can use inexpensive equipment spawned by the Internet revolution to support from afar civilian health care delivery in a high-conflict country.},

More specifically, wireless sensors are also being used to monitor buildings. This work proposes and presents the development of a surface temperature sensor that can support actions to enhance energy efficiency in the built environment, meeting the requirements proposed by the energy efficiency rating systems of buildings. This sensor must have characteristics such as low cost, the storage capacity of a large amount of data and the possibility of remote monitoring of the collected temperatures.

	abstract = {Spiders are fascinating model species to study information-acquisition strategies, with the web acting as an extension of the animal's body. Here, we compare the strategies of two orb-weaving spiders that acquire information through vibrations transmitted and filtered in the web. Whereas Araneus diadematus monitors web vibration directly on the web, Zygiella x-notata uses a signal thread to remotely monitor web vibration from a retreat, which gives added protection. We assess the implications of these two information-acquisition strategies on the quality of vibration information transfer, using laser Doppler vibrometry to measure vibrations of real webs and finite element analysis in computer models of webs. We observed that the signal thread imposed no biologically relevant time penalty for vibration propagation. However, loss of energy (attenuation) was a cost associated with remote monitoring via a signal thread. The findings have implications for the biological use of vibrations by spiders, including the mechanisms to locate and discriminate between vibration sources. We show that orb-weaver spiders are fascinating examples of organisms that modify their physical environment to shape their information-acquisition strategy.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Telecare and telehealth developments have recently attracted much attention in research and service development contexts, where their evaluation has predominantly concerned effectiveness and efficiency. Their social and ethical implications, in contrast, have received little scrutiny.
OBJECTIVE: To develop an ethical framework for telecare systems based on analysis of observations of telecare-in-use and citizens' panel deliberations.
DESIGN: Ethnographic study (observation, work shadowing), interviews, older citizens' panels and a participative conference.
SETTING: Participants' homes, workplaces and familiar community venues in England, Spain, the Netherlands and Norway 2008-2011.
RESULTS: Older respondents expressed concerns that telecare might be used to replace face-to-face/hands-on care to cut costs. Citizens' panels strongly advocated ethical and social questions being considered in tandem with technical and policy developments. Older people are too often excluded from telecare system design, and installation is often wrongly seen as a one-off event. Some systems enhance self-care by increasing self-awareness, while others shift agency away from the older person, introducing new forms of dependency.
CONCLUSIONS: Telecare has care limitations; it is not a solution, but a shift in networks of relations and responsibilities. Telecare cannot be meaningfully evaluated as an entity, but rather in the situated relations people and technologies create together. Characteristics of ethical telecare include on-going user/carer engagement in decision making about systems: in-home system evolution with feedback opportunities built into implementation. System design should be horizontal, 'two-way'/interactive rather than vertical or 'one-way'. An ethical framework for telecare has been developed from these conclusions (Table 1).},

DESIGN: Observational study with one baseline period and two comparison periods (eICU wave one and eICU wave two). Each time period was 4 months in duration.
SETTING: Four ICU from two community hospitals in the metropolitan Chicago area. Hospital one is a 610-bed teaching hospital with three adult ICU (ten-bed medical ICU, ten-bed cardiac ICU, and 14-bed surgical ICU). Hospital two is a 185-bed nonteaching hospital with a ten-bed mixed medical/surgical ICU.
PATIENTS: All patients 18 yrs or older with an ICU stay of at least 4 hrs during the specified time period were included.
INTERVENTIONS: The eICU was implemented at both hospitals in April 2003.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mortality, length of stay, and total cost were measured. Age, gender, race/ethnicity, trauma status, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score, and physician utilization of the eICU were included as covariates.Included in the analysis were 4088 patients (1371 at baseline, 1287 in eICU wave one, and 1430 in eICU wave two). The eICU did not have a significant effect on ICU/non-ICU/total mortality or hospital length of stay. ICU length of stay increased over time and was associated with higher physician utilization of the eICU. Although total hospital costs increased over time, the rate of increase was steeper for those patients whose physicians permitted only a low level of eICU involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study of {\textgreater}4000 patients representing two community hospitals, we did not find a reduction in mortality, length of stay, or hospital cost attributable to the introduction of the eICU.},

Whilst the introduction of new technologies has improved access to healthcare, it has also created new challenges. The aim of this paper was to review the literature on the use of Instant Messaging (IM) and IM applications (apps) in dermatology.
METHOD: PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct were searched for multiple terms for 20 individual IM apps linked to the terms telehealth, telemedicine, ehealth, e-health, mhealth, or m-health. After title and abstract review, 31 papers met the inclusion criteria of IM use in dermatology.
RESULTS: Three papers, all from the developing world reported the benefits of using IM in a clinical dermatology service. Other uses included behavioural change, disease management, diagnosis, triage, screening, diagnoses, home monitoring, education, and administrative. Little mention was made of medico-legal issues such as consent, confidentiality, privacy and data security and storage.
CONCLUSION: Currently there is little use of IM in clinical dermatology services, but its potential is great. There is need to address ethical and medico-legal concerns and develop guidelines for its use. IM is a simple, cheap and effective solution for the developing world.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telehealth has been considered a practical and potentially cost-effective method of providing healthcare to the underprivileged population. The aim of this study was to determine whether a teledentistry system is a valid tool to screen for the presence of dental caries in a cohort of 102 Brazilian juvenile offenders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical examinations were performed to evaluate the decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) index and oral conditions of each adolescent, documented using a digital camera. For distant diagnosis, two methods of image transmission were tested. In the first, images were uploaded on a file-sharing service, and the link was sent via e-mail to one distant consultant. The other consultant received the images recorded on a compact disc. Both assessed the files and calculated the DMFT index for each case. The degree of agreement between the traditional examination and distant consultant assessments was measured by the kappa coefficient of agreement. Sensitivity and specificity were also calculated.
RESULTS: According to the traditional clinical examination, 93.1\% of the adolescents had at least one instance of dental caries with a mean DMFT index of 5.9. Kappa statistics ranged from "strong" to "almost perfect." Sensitivity ranged from 48\% to 73\%, and specificity was either 97\% or 98\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent inmates could benefit from oral health screening using digital photography. Teledentistry appears to be a reliable alternative to the traditional oral examination for dental caries assessment.},

PTSD is a prevalent mental health problem found among returning Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) military populations. These returning military personnel often live in rural areas and therefore have limited access to care and specialized psychological treatments. In the field of mental health, telemental health (TMH) technology has introduced a potential solution to the persistent problem of access to care in remote areas. This study is enrolling approximately 126 returning veterans with current combat-related PTSD who are receiving services through the Veteran Administration (VA) mental health care clinics on 4 Hawaiian Islands. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), an empirically supported manualized treatment for PTSD, is being delivered across 9 cohorts. Participants are assigned to either the experimental VTC condition or the in-person control condition. Assessments measuring clinical, process, and cost outcomes are being conducted at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3 and 6 months post-treatment. The study employs a noninferiority design to determine if the group treatment delivered via VTC is as good as the traditional in-person modality. In addition, a cost analysis will be performed in order to compare the cost of the 2 modalities. Novel aspects of this trial and specific challenges are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although effective psychotherapies for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exist, high percentages of Veterans in need of services are unable to access them. One particular challenge to providing cost-effective psychological treatments to Veterans with PTSD involves the difficulty and high cost of delivering in-person, specialized psychotherapy to Veterans residing in geographically remote locations. The delivery of these services via clinical videoteleconferencing (CVT) has been presented as a potential solution to this access to care problem.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective cost analysis of a randomized controlled trial investigating telemedicine service delivery of an anger management therapy for Veterans with PTSD. The parent trial found that the CVT condition provided clinical results that were comparable to the in-person condition. Several cost outcomes were calculated in order to investigate the clinical and cost outcomes associated with the CVT delivery modality relative to in-person delivery.
RESULTS: The CVT condition was significantly associated with lower total costs compared with the in-person delivery condition. The delivery of mental health services via CVT enables Veterans who would not normally receive these services access to empirically based treatments. Additional studies addressing long-term healthcare system costs, indirect cost factors at the patient and societal levels, and the use of CVT in other geographic regions of the United States are needed.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide evidence that CVT is a cost-reducing mode of service delivery to Veterans with PTSD relative to in-person delivery.},

OBJECTIVES: To examine the use of computerized analysis of respiratory sounds, a hybrid system based on principal component analysis (PCA) and probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), to aid the detection of coexisting pneumonia in patients with COPD.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A convenience sample of 58 patients with COPD (25 patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia and 33 owing to acute exacerbation of COPD) was studied. Auscultations were performed by the patients themselves on their suprasternal notch. Short-time Fourier transform analysis was used to extract features from the recorded respiratory sounds, PCA was selected for dimensionality reduction and a PNN was trained as classifier. 10-Fold cross-validation and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used to estimate the system performance.
RESULTS: Based on the cross-validation results, a sensitivity and a specificity of 72\% and 81.8\%, respectively, were achieved in validation data. The operating point was selected to maximize the specificity and sensitivity pair in the training set.
DISCUSSION: The results strongly suggest that electronic self-auscultation at a single location (suprasternal notch) can support diagnosis of pneumonia in patients with COPD.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple, cost-effective method has been proposed to aid decision-making in areas with no radiological facilities available and in resource-constrained settings, and could have a great diagnostic impact on telemedicine applications.},

METHODS: REM-HF is a multicentre, randomized, non-blinded, parallel trial designed to compare weekly remote monitoring-driven management with usual care for patients with cardiac implanted electronic devices (ICD, CRT-D, or CRT-P). The trial is event driven, and the final analysis will be performed when 546 events have been observed or the study is terminated at the interim analysis. We have randomized 1650 patients to be followed up for a minimum of 2 years. Patients will remain in the trial up to study termination. The first patient was randomized in September 2011 and the study is expected to complete in early 2016. The primary combined endpoint is time to first event of all-cause death or unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. An economic evaluation will be performed, estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life year, with direct costs estimated from the National Health Service perspective and quality of life assessed by the EQ-5D, Short-Form 12, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaires. The study design has been informed by a feasibility study.
CONCLUSION: REM-HF is a multicentre randomized study that will provide important data on the effect of remote monitoring-driven management of implanted cardiac devices on morbidity and mortality, as well as the cost-effectiveness of this approach.},

	abstract = {Aims: Remote management of heart failure using implantable electronic devices (REM-HF) aimed to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of remote monitoring (RM) of heart failure in patients with cardiac implanted electronic devices (CIEDs).
Methods and results: Between 29 September 2011 and 31 March 2014, we randomly assigned 1650 patients with heart failure and a CIED to active RM or usual care (UC). The active RM pathway included formalized remote follow-up protocols, and UC was standard practice in nine recruiting centres in England. The primary endpoint in the time to event analysis was the 1st event of death from any cause or unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. Secondary endpoints included death from any cause, death from cardiovascular reasons, death from cardiovascular reasons and unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization, unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization, and unplanned hospitalization. REM-HF is registered with ISRCTN (96536028). The mean age of the population was 70 years (range 23-98); 86\% were male. Patients were followed for a median of 2.8 years (range 0-4.3 years) completing on 31 January 2016. Patient adherence was high with a drop out of 4.3\% over the course of the study. The incidence of the primary endpoint did not differ significantly between active RM and UC groups, which occurred in 42.4 and 40.8\% of patients, respectively [hazard ratio 1.01; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-1.18; P = 0.87]. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to any of the secondary endpoints or the time to the primary endpoint components.
Conclusion: Among patients with heart failure and a CIED, RM using weekly downloads and a formalized follow up approach does not improve outcomes.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two cohorts of beneficiaries (n = 1,665 and 504, respectively) living in two medically underserved areas of New York between 2000 and 2007 were randomized to intensive nurse case management via televisits or usual care. Medicare service use and costs covering a 6-year follow-up period were drawn from claims data. Impacts were estimated using regression analyses.
RESULTS: Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) did not reduce Medicare costs in either site. Total costs were between 71 and 116\% higher for the treatment group than for the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Although IDEATel had modest effects on clinical outcomes (reported elsewhere), it did not reduce Medicare use or costs for health services. The intervention's costs were excessive (over \$8,000 per person per year) compared with programs with similar-sized clinical impacts.},

The Internet has made it possible to deliver telemedicine care economically to areas and populations with limited access to specialist or culturally and linguistically congruent care.
METHODS: This study compared the effectiveness for Hispanic patients of depression treatment provided by a psychiatrist through Internet videoconferencing (Webcam intervention) and treatment as usual by a primary care provider. Adults (N=167) with a diagnosis of depression were recruited from a community clinic and were randomly assigned to treatment condition. Webcam participants met remotely each month with the psychiatrist, and treatment-as-usual patients received customary care from their primary care providers, all for six months. At baseline and three and six months, analyses of variance tested differences between conditions in scores on depression rating scales and quality-of-life and functional ability measures.
RESULTS: All participants experienced an improvement in depression symptoms. Ratings on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale by clinicians blind to treatment group and self-ratings on the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, and Sheehan Disability Scale showed a significant main effect of time. On all four measures, a significant interaction of time by intervention favoring the Webcam group was noted.
DISCUSSION: Results suggest that telepsychiatry delivered through the Internet utilizing commercially available domestic Webcams and standard Internet and computer equipment is effective and acceptable. Use of this technology may help close the gap in access to culturally and linguistically congruent specialists.},

However, it has failed to live up to expectation, in part because of poor objective measures of symptoms such as cough events, which could lead to early diagnosis or prevention. Considering the burden that these conditions constitute for national health systems, an effort is needed to foster telehealth potential by developing low-cost technology for efficient monitoring and analysis of cough events. This paper proposes the use of local Hu moments as a robust feature set for automatic cough detection in smartphone-acquired audio signals. The final system feeds a k-nearest-neighbor classifier with the extracted features. To properly evaluate the system in a diversity of noisy backgrounds, we contaminated real cough audio data with a variety of sounds including noise from both indoor and outdoor environments and noncough events (sneeze, laugh, speech, etc.). The created database allows flexible settings of signal-to-noise ratio levels between background sounds and events (cough and noncough). This evaluation was complemented using real patient data from an outpatient clinic. The system is able to detect cough events with high sensitivity (up to 88.51\%) and specificity (up to 99.77\%) in a variety of noisy environments, overcoming other state-of-the-art audio features. Our proposal paves the way for ubiquitous cough monitoring with minimal disruption in daily activities.},

The Department of Defense recognized early the capacity of telemedicine to deliver medical care and support to front-line military personnel. In 1989, the Texas Telemedicine Project received grants and support from the then American Telephone and Telegraph Company (now AT\&T) and the Meadows Foundation of Dallas, Texas, to establish and evaluate telemedicine delivery in central Texas. That project had 6 connected telemedicine sites: 3 in Austin, Texas, and 3 in Giddings, Texas (a small community 55 miles to the southeast of Austin). The sites in Giddings included a chronic outpatient dialysis facility, an inpatient psychiatric hospital, and the emergency department at Giddings Hospital. Patient contact began in April 1991 and continued through March 1993. During that period, data on the 1500 patient contacts made were recorded. After termination of the Texas Telemedicine Project, AT\&T continued to provide the transmission lines, and between 1993 and 1996, another 12,000 patient contacts were made. Approximately 80\% were dialysis evaluations and 20\% were non-dialysis primary care contacts. The original cost of materials and equipment in the Texas Telemedicine Project exceeded \$50,000 per site. Today, a secure Internet connection with full-motion video and wireless data transfer to almost any location in the world is achievable with an iPad. Multiple inexpensive applications with connections for electrocardiogram, otoscope, and stethoscope, among others, make this technology extremely inexpensive and user-friendly. The revolution now is rapidly moving forward, with Medicare reimbursing telemedicine contacts in medically underserved areas. Multiple bills are before Congress to expand Medicare and therefore private insurance payment for this service.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Telemedicine use in addiction treatment and recovery services is limited. Yet, because it removes barriers of time and distance, telemedicine offers great potential for enhancing treatment and recovery for people with substance use disorders (SUDs). Telemedicine also offers clinicians ways to increase contact with SUD patients during and after treatment.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A project conducted from February 2013 to June 2014 investigated the adoption of telemedicine services among purchasers of addiction treatment in five states and one county. The project assessed purchasers' interest in and perceived facilitators and barriers to implementing one or more of the following telemedicine modalities: telephone-based care, web-based screening, web-based treatment, videoconferencing, smartphone mobile applications (apps), and virtual worlds.
DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: Purchasers expressed the most interest in implementing videoconferencing and smartphone mobile devices. The anticipated facilitators for implementing a telemedicine app included funding available to pay for the telemedicine service, local examples of success, influential champions at the payer and treatment agencies, and meeting a pressing need. The greatest barriers identified were: costs associated with implementation, lack of reimbursement for telemedicine services, providers' unfamiliarity with technology, lack of implementation models, and confidentiality regulations. This paper discusses why the project participants selected or rejected different telemedicine modalities and the policy implications that purchasers and regulators of addiction treatment services should consider for expanding their use of telemedicine.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides initial observations into how telemedicine is being implemented in addiction services in five states and one county. The project demonstrated that despite the considerable interest in telemedicine, implementation challenges exist. Future studies should broaden the sample analyzed and track technology implementation longitudinally to help the research and practitioner communities develop a greater understanding of technology implementation trends and practices.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: For the last decade a host of different projects have been launched to allow persons who are concerned about their hearing status to quickly and at a low cost test their hearing ability. Most often, this is carried out without collecting complementary information that could be correlated with hearing impairment. In this two-part study we first, present the development and validation of a novel Internet-based hearing test, and second, report on the associations between this test and phonological representation, quality of life and self-reported hearing difficulties.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: An opportunity sample of participants was recruited at the Stockholm central station for the first study. All parts of the second study were conducted via the Internet, with testing and self-report forms adapted for online use.
PARTICIPANTS: The first part of the study was carried out in direct contact with the participants, and participants from the second study were recruited by means of advertisements in newspapers and on webpages. The only exclusion criterion was that participants had to be over 18 years old. Most participants were between 60 and 69 years old. There were almost an equal number of men and women (total n=316).
OUTCOME MEASURES: 48 participants failed the Internet-based hearing screening test. The group failing the test reported more problems on the Amsterdam Inventory of Auditory Disability. In addition, they were found to have diminished phonological representational skills. However, no difference in quality of life was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Almost one in five participants was in need of contacting their local hearing clinic. This group had more complaints regarding tinnitus and hyperacusis, rated their own hearing as worse than those who passed, and had a poorer capability of generating accurate phonological representations. This study suggests that it is feasible to screen for hearing status online, and obtain valid data.},

This study was planned to compare the costing and feasibility of three different service delivery models. The end user was a state-funded long-stay Rehabilitation Center (RC) for the homeless.
METHODOLOGY: Model A comprised patients going to a tertiary care center for clinical care, Model B was community outreach service, and Model C comprised telepsychiatry services. The costing included expenses incurred by the health system to complete a single consultation for a patient on an outpatient basis. It specifically excluded the cost borne by the care-receiver. No patients were interviewed for the study.
RESULTS: The RC had 736 inmates, of which 341 had mental illness of very long duration. On comparing the costing, Model A costed 6047.5 INR (100\$), Model B costed 577.1 INR (9.1\$), and Model C costed 137.2 INR (2.2\$). Model C was found fifty times more economical when compared to Model A and four times more economical when compared to Model B.
CONCLUSION: Telepsychiatry services connecting tertiary center and a primary health-care center have potential to be an economical model of service delivery compared to other traditional ones. This resource needs to be tapped in a better fashion to reach the unreached.},

	abstract = {The rupture of a cerebral aneurysm is the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Endovascular embolization of the aneurysms by implantation of Guglielmi detachable coils (GDC) has become a major treatment approach in the prevention of a rupture. Implantation of the coils induces formation of tissues over the coils, embolizing the aneurysm. However, blood entry into the coiled aneurysm often occurs due to failures in the embolization process. Current diagnostic methods used for aneurysms, such as X-ray angiography and computer tomography, are ineffective for continuous monitoring of the disease and require extremely expensive equipment. Here we present a novel technique for wireless monitoring of cerebral aneurysms using implanted embolization coils as radiofrequency resonant sensors that detect the blood entry. The experiments show that commonly used embolization coils could be utilized as electrical inductors or antennas. As the blood flows into a coil-implanted aneurysm, parasitic capacitance of the coil is modified because of the difference in permittivity between the blood and the tissues grown around the coil, resulting in a change in the coil's resonant frequency. The resonances of platinum GDC-like coils embedded in aneurysm models are detected to show average responses of 224-819 MHz/ml to saline injected into the models. This preliminary demonstration indicates a new possibility in the use of implanted GDC as a wireless sensor for embolization failures, the first step toward realizing long-term, noninvasive, and cost-effective remote monitoring of cerebral aneurysms treated with coil embolization.},

Satisfaction of patients toward in-home telerehabilitation after TKA has not yet been examined thoroughly in large-scale clinical trials. This study aims to compare satisfaction level of patients following in-home telerehabilitation (TELE) after TKA to one of the patients following a usual face-to-face home visit (STD) rehabilitation. Secondarily, to determine if any clinical or personal variables were associated to the level of satisfaction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was embedded in a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 205 patients randomized into two groups. Rehabilitation intervention was the same for both groups; only approach for service delivery differed (telerehabilitation or home visits). Participants were assessed at baseline (before TKA), at hospital discharge, and at 2 and 4 months postdischarge (E4) using functional outcomes. Patient satisfaction was measured using the validated Health Care Satisfaction Questionnaire (HCSQ) at E4.
RESULTS: Characteristics of all participants were similar at baseline. Satisfaction level of both groups did not differ and was very high (over 85\%). It was neither correlated to personal characteristics nor to improvements of functional level from preoperative to E4. Satisfaction was rather found associated to walking and stair-climbing performances.
CONCLUSIONS: These results, in conjunction with evidences of clinical effectiveness and cost benefits demonstrated in the same sample of patients, strongly support the use of telerehabilitation to improve access to rehabilitation services and efficiency of service delivery after TKA.},

	volume = {11},
	issn = {1445-6354},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The continued poorer health status of rural and remote Australians when compared with their urban counterparts is cause for concern. The use of advanced technology to improve access to health care has the potential to assist in addressing this problem. Telemedicine is one example of such technology which has advanced rapidly in its capacity to increase access to healthcare services or provide previously unavailable services. The important anticipated benefits of greater access to healthcare services are improved health outcomes and more cost-effective delivery.
METHODS: A national study was conducted to investigate the current perceived use and usefulness of telemedicine from the perspective of users and providers, and their views on how telemedicine could be expanded in Australia. In one component of this national study, the expert opinion of experienced providers of telemedicine services was elicited using a Grounded Theory approach and using semi-structured interviews which were analysed thematically. This article reports on the barriers to the up-take of telemedicine identified by this sub-sample.
RESULTS: The primary barriers identified were: funding; time; infrastructure; equipment; skills; and preference for the traditional approach. While funding is a well-known barrier to the up-take of telemedicine, the extra time required for a telemedicine consultation has particular implications for the workload of rural doctors. The comparatively poor internet access available in rural Australia combines with difficulties accessing some items such as a computer, to make equipment an issue. Even though lack of equipment skills was identified as a barrier, the providers in this study reported that rural doctors are adept at using the telephone/teleconferencing and facsimile. A preference for a traditional approach can reflect a lack of interest in learning computer skills or difficulty acquiring this skill set.
CONCLUSIONS: These results raise issues in the domains of policy, funding priorities, and education and training. This indicates an inter-related set of challenges that would require a targeted multifaceted approach to address. The results suggest that not using telemedicine is, in the current climate, a rational response--it is quicker, easier and more cost-effective not to use telemedicine.},

RECENT FINDINGS: We discuss several categories of telehealth that have been applied to healthcare. Several of these approaches, in particular video visits and teleconsultations, have promising early data demonstrating the significant benefits of telehealth technology with respect to the quality of care, access, cost savings, and patient experience. Nonetheless, considerable knowledge gaps still exist regarding how and for which patients and diseases telehealth modalities should be applied. Finally, we discuss the barriers to widespread adoption at the institutional, state, and federal levels.
SUMMARY: Maximizing the value of healthcare is an important goal for hospitals, physicians, and policymakers. Telehealth leverages advances in technology and the widespread availability of telecommunications devices to make healthcare communication more available, more convenient, and more efficient for patients and providers. With appropriate policies and incentives, telehealth initiatives can improve the value of urologic care and smooth the transition to a value-based healthcare system.},

Evidence on costs and outcomes for standard-risk pregnant women during the antenatal period was based on patient-level data. Extrapolation beyond the end of the study (just after delivery) was carried out for the lifetime of children born with and without CHD. Expert opinion and data from published sources was used to populate a decision model. Future costs and benefits were discounted. The main outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and results were expressed as cost per QALY gained. Various one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. The model showed that offering telemedicine screening by specialists to all standard-risk pregnant women was the dominant strategy (i.e. cheaper and more effective). The sensitivity analyses found that the model was robust, and that telemedicine remained the most cost-effective strategy. The study showed that it would be cost-effective to provide telemedicine examinations as part of an antenatal screening programme for all standard-risk women.},

This study explores two approaches in obtaining cost estimates for pregnant women screened for a fetal cardiac anomaly.
METHODS: Two methods to reduce selection bias in health care: regression analyses and propensity scoring methods were applied to the total mean costs of pregnancy for women who received specialist cardiac advice by means of two referral modes: telemedicine and direct referral.
RESULTS: The observed total mean costs of pregnancy were higher for the telemedicine group than the direct referral group (4,918 versus 4,311 GBP). The regression model found that referral mode was not a significant predictor of costs and the cost difference between the two groups was reduced from 607 to 94 GBP. After applying the various propensity score methods, the groups were balanced in terms of sizes and compositions; and again the cost differences between the two groups were smaller ranging from -62 (matching "by hand") to 333 GBP (kernel matching).
CONCLUSIONS: Regression analyses and propensity scoring methods applied to the dataset may have increased the homogeneity and reduced the variance in the adjusted costs; that is, these methods have allowed the observed selection bias to be reduced. I believe that propensity scoring methods worked better for this dataset, because after matching the two groups were similar in terms of background characteristics and the adjusted cost differences were smaller.},

The technological advances in mobile computing are enhancing the quality of healthcare and a user can access these services using its mobile device. However, user and Telecare system communicate via public channels in these online services which increase the security risk. Therefore, it is required to ensure that only authorized user is accessing the system and user is interacting with the correct system. The mutual authentication provides the way to achieve this. Although existing schemes are either vulnerable to attacks or they have higher computational cost while an scalable authentication scheme for mobile devices should be secure and efficient. Recently, Awasthi and Srivastava presented a biometric based authentication scheme for TMIS with nonce. Their scheme only requires the computation of the hash and XOR functions.pagebreak Thus, this scheme fits for TMIS. However, we observe that Awasthi and Srivastava's scheme does not achieve efficient password change phase. Moreover, their scheme does not resist off-line password guessing attack. Further, we propose an improvement of Awasthi and Srivastava's scheme with the aim to remove the drawbacks of their scheme.},

Telemonitoring of patients with COPD may help to reduce the number of exacerbations and/or the related costs. On the other hand, home hospitalization is a cost-saving alternative to inpatient hospitalization associated with increased comfort for patients. The results are reported regarding using telemonitoring and home hospitalization for the management of patients with COPD.
METHODS: Twenty-eight patients monitored their health parameters at home for six months. A nurse remotely revised the collected parameters and followed the patients as programmed. A home care unit was dispatched to the patients' home if an alarm signal was detected. The outcomes were compared to historical data from the same patients.
RESULTS: The number of COPD exacerbations during the study period did not reduce but the number of hospital admissions decreased by 60\% and the number of emergency room visits by 38\%. On average, costs related to utilization of healthcare resources were reduced by €1,860.80 per patient per year.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring of patients with COPD combined with home hospitalization may allow for a reduction in healthcare costs, although its usefulness in preventing exacerbations is still unclear.},

Existing solutions (eg, technology transfer offices and dual degree MD/MBA programs) are often unavailable to researchers from outside the institution or to those who have already completed their primary education, such as practicing physicians. This paper explores current solutions and offers a partial solution: include venture capital (VC) panels in medical conferences. These VC panels educate academics on 2 important and interconnected issues: how to "pitch" their ideas in the business world and what to consider when creating a company. In these sessions, academia-based start-up companies present their ideas before a VC panel composed of professional investors and receive feedback on their idea, business plan, and presentation techniques. Recent panel recommendations from Medicine 2.0 conferences fell into 7 categories: (1) the product, service, or idea you are developing into a company, (2) determine market forces and identify the target audience, (3) describe your competitive advantage, (4) the business plan, (5) current and future resources and capabilities, (6) legal aspects, and (7) general advice on the art of pitching. The academic and business literature validates many of these recommendations suggesting that VC panels may be a viable and cost-effective introduction to business and entrepreneurial education for physicians and other health care professionals. Panels benefit not only the presenting companies, but also the physicians, psychologists, and other health care professionals attending the session. Incorporating VC panels into academic conferences might also illuminate the need for incorporating relevant business training within academia.},

We are reporting the results of a larger sample size over a 3-year study period to test the validity of our original observations.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine patients were included in this study; 43 (18 females, 25 males) with a mean age of 58.6 years were enrolled in the remote technology (RT) group, and 56 (26 females, 30 males) with a mean age of 63.1 years were enrolled in the usual-care (UC) group. Health resource outcome measures included hospitalizations, emergency room (ER) visits, and number of days hospitalized. Economic analysis was conducted on hospital and ER charges.
RESULTS: Hospitalizations (RT, 1.8; UC, 3.0), hospital days (RT, 11.6; UC, 25.0), and hospital and ER charges (RT, \$66,000; UC, \$157,000) were significantly lower in the RT group, as were hospital and ER charges per study day (RT, \$159; UC, \$317).

Results indicate that few people are using digital technology to get information, communicate with health personnel, or make online medical purchases. Furthermore, less well educated, lower-income individuals living in rural areas tend to use the health care Internet less than others. Several policy measures need to be undertaken in order to accelerate the appropriate use of digital technology by health care consumers of all kinds.

Our purpose was to evaluate the emergency stroke resources available at and care provided by remote Arizona hospitals and to formulate a 5-year stroke telemedicine plan for Arizona rural residents. We used the Arizona Hospital and Healthcare Association Web site to identify all eligible institutions. Consenting personnel were mailed the survey on behalf of the Arizona Department of Health Services. To construct the 5-year telemedicine plan, we used survey data as well as our previously designed stroke telemedicine research trial. We estimated the resources, the geographic coverage, and the operating costs. Thirty-five hospitals met survey eligibility criteria; however, 24/35 (69\%) hospitals completed the survey. Only one hospital had neurologists on call 24/7. Hospitals thrombolysed 2\%-4\% of all stroke patients annually. Ninety percent of the hospitals were interested in participating in a statewide telemedicine initiative. The stroke telemedicine plan divided Arizona into two regions, each with a one-hub to three-spoke ratio. The budget was estimated to be U.S. \$8,141,217.10 for 5 years. Remote communities of Arizona were underserviced with regard to the availability of neurologists and the delivery of emergency stroke care. The majority of the remote emergency departments were interested in participating as spoke sites in a statewide stroke telemedicine initiative. Telemedicine may be an effective method to provide expert care to stroke patients located in rural areas.},

Early diagnosis of glaucoma, which does not necessarily involve raised intraocular pressure, is essential because by the time the patient notices functional impairment the damage is irreversible. Early treatment can decrease the rate of blindness 20 years later by about 50\%.
METHODS: Selective literature review and clinical investigation of early glaucoma detection and of screening methods.
RESULTS: Currently, no evidence-based recommendations for glaucoma screening can be found in the literature. No single method or combination of screening procedures can be recommended unambiguously on economic grounds.
DISCUSSION: From the clinical perspective sensitive, specific, and cost-effective glaucoma screening seems feasible. The high-risk group would need to be defined on the basis of age and family history. A two-stage screening process would then have to be established with initial computer-supported telemedical sorting followed by telemedical ophthalmological diagnosis of cases selected for clarification.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.cmpb.2018.05.021},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Currently, telemedicine is levered upon the improvement in communication network technology such as Body Area Sensor Networks (BASN) to provided biomedicine solutions. Nevertheless, information security is an important issue since biomedical data is exchanged through insecure channels, which exposes private information that can be intercepted by malicious intruder. Therefore, secure communication protocols for multiuser networks in telemedicine applications are a big challenge. Recent chaos-based encryption works have been conducted in the area of medical secure communications with high security capabilities. However, none of them has considered multiuser network, which is used in several e-health applications. Up to our knowledge, the proposed protocol is the first attempt to consider this service in secure telemedicine. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme based on binary phase-shift key (BPSK) and chaos to provide information security at biosignals in a multiuser network system transmitting data over single channel.
METHODS: The proposed scheme uses the two-dimensional Hénon map with enhance pseudorandom sequences and CDMA technique to achieve multiuser encryption process and transmit data over a single channel. We use biosignals such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and blood pressure (PB) signals from PhisioBank ATM data base for simulation results at MatLab software. We evaluate the security and performance by determining the secret key space, secret key sensitivity, resistance against noise attack with quality analysis by using BER, MSE, and PSNR, encryption-decryption time, and throughput.
RESULTS: In simulations tests, biosignals of ECG and BP in a BANS network are encrypted and transmitted over shared wireless channels and just authorized medical personal can retrieve such information with corresponding secret key from the cryptogram, that appears as noise to any intruder. The proposed multiuser scheme support high noise and interference attacks efficiently in contrast with classic chaos-based encryption works for telemedicine, where some scenarios are simulated with very low BER, very low MSE, and high PSNR between plain biosignals and recovered biosignals when high AWGN noise is added to encrypted-transmitted signal. In addition, the encryption process presents enough key space and high sensitivity at secret key. A comparative analysis of proposed method and recent existing works was also presented.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients can be monitored and diagnosed opportunely remotely and all their medical information is transmitted securely to the correct specialist. Also, it is possible to transmit several electrophysiological signals in a single channel in a secure multiuser network at low cost optimizing the use of available bandwidth for telemedicine applications.},

We describe the implementation process, including whether the project was implemented according to plan; identify barriers and facilitators to implementation; and assess the incremental benefit to the quality of health care for fall prevention received by patients in the project. We also estimate the cost of developing the pilot project.
RESULTS: The project underwent multiple changes over its life span, including the addition of an option to mail patients educational materials about falls. During the project's lifespan, 113 patients were considered for inclusion and 35 participated. Patient and employee interviews suggested support for the project, but revealed that transportation to medical care was a major barrier in following up on fall risks identified by nurse telephone triage. Medical record review showed that the project enhanced usual medical care with respect to home safety counseling. We discontinued the program after 18 months due to staffing limitations and competing priorities. We estimated a cost of \$9194 for meeting time to develop the project.
CONCLUSIONS: The project appeared feasible at its outset but could not be sustained past the first cycle of evaluation due to insufficient resources and a waning of local leadership support due to competing national priorities. Future projects will need both front-level staff commitment and prolonged high-level leadership involvement to thrive.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A virtual clinic is a form of telemedicine where contact between clinical teams and patients occur without face-to-face consultation. Our study aims to quantify the clinical, financial and environmental benefits of our virtual urology clinic.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We collected data prospectively from our weekly follow-up virtual clinic over a continuous four-month period between July and September 2017.
RESULTS: In total, we reviewed 409 patients. Following virtual clinic consultation, 68.5\% of our patients were discharged from further follow-up. The majority of our patients (male 57.7\%, female 55.5\%) were of working age. The satisfaction scores were high, at 90.1\%, and there were no reported adverse events as a result of using the virtual clinic. Our calculated cost savings were £18,744, with a predicted 12-month cost saving of £56,232. The creation of additional face-to-face clinic capacity has created an estimated 12-month increase in tariff generation for our unit of £72,072. In total, 4623 travel miles were avoided by patients using the virtual clinic, with an estimated avoided carbon footprint of 0.35-1.45 metric tonnes of CO2e, depending on mode of transport. Our predicted 12-month avoided carbon footprint is 1.04-4.04 metric tonnes of CO2e.
CONCLUSIONS: Our virtual clinic model has demonstrated a trifecta of positive outcomes, namely, clinical, financial and environmental benefits. The environmental importance and benefits of a virtual clinic should be promoted as a social enterprise value when engaging stakeholders in setting up such a urological service. We propose the adoption of our virtual clinic model in those urological units considering this method of telemedicine.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: International normalized ratio self-testing with online remote monitoring and management (STORM₂) is an alternative to anticoagulation clinic management, but the patient's perspective of this method has not been evaluated in the United States; thus we sought to evaluate the impact of STORM₂ on patient satisfaction, time, and cost.
DESIGN: Prospective pre- and postintervention study.
SETTING: Freestanding clinical research center.
PATIENTS: Forty-three patients treated with long-term warfarin therapy and monitored initially in the anticoagulation clinic setting and then with STORM₂, referred from 11 medical practices.
INTERVENTION: Patients were asked to complete a survey and the Duke Anticoagulation Satisfaction Scale (DASS) before (at baseline) and after at least 3 months of STORM₂ (at follow-up).
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patient satisfaction and time were assessed by survey and the DASS. Costs were measured from the patient's perspective. Overall 90\% of responders preferred STORM₂ to traditional clinic management. The DASS questions indicated that patients were more satisfied with their anticoagulation treatment and more likely to recommend oral anticoagulation to a friend after experiencing STORM₂. In addition, patients found STORM₂ to be less complicated and more convenient than traditional clinic management. For each traditional monthly visit, patients drove 20 miles and expended a total of 1.8 hours; using 55¢/mile for mileage reimbursement and \$15/hour for lost wages, the cost for each visit was \$38. The total cost for four STORM₂ visits per month was \$10, for a net savings of \$28 per patient per month. A total of 76\% of patients were willing to pay additional money to eliminate a monthly clinic visit.
CONCLUSION: STORM₂ is more convenient, less complicated, preferred by patients, and saves patients time and money compared with clinic management.},

Typically, incentives (e.g., "vouchers" exchangeable for goods or services) are contingent on individual performance. We programmed vouchers contingent on group performance to investigate whether these contingencies would promote brief abstinence from cigarette smoking. Thirty-two participants were divided into small teams (n = 3 per team). During three 5-day within-subject experimental conditions, participants submitted video recordings of breath carbon monoxide (CO) measures twice daily via Motiv8 Systems, an Internet-based remote monitoring application. During the interdependent contingency condition, participants earned vouchers each time they and their teammates submitted breath CO samples indicative of abstinence (i.e., negative samples). During the independent contingency condition, participants earned vouchers each time they submitted negative samples, regardless of their teammates' performance. During the no vouchers condition, no monetary incentives were contingent on abstinence. In addition, half of the participants (n = 16) could communicate with their teammates through an online peer support forum. Although forum access did not appear to promote smoking abstinence, monetary incentives did promote brief abstinence. Significantly more negative samples were submitted when vouchers were contingent on individual performance (56\%) or team performance (53\%) relative to when no vouchers were available (35\%; F = 6.9, p = .002). The results show that interdependent contingencies can promote brief abstinence from cigarette smoking.

The Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) allows the non-invasive investigation of the internal body structure. The characteristics of this low-resolution and low-cost technique match perfectly with the concept of a wearable imaging device. On the other hand low power consumption, which is a mandatory requirement for wearable systems, is not usually discussed for standard EIT applications. In this work a previously developed low power architecture for a wearable bioimpedance sensor is applied to EIT acquisition and reconstruction, to evaluate the impact on the image of the limited signal to noise ratio (SNR), caused by low power design. Some anatomical models of the chest, with increasing geometric complexity, were developed, in order to evaluate and calibrate, through simulations, the parameters of the reconstruction algorithms provided by Electrical Impedance Diffuse Optical Reconstruction Software (EIDORS) project. The simulation results were compared with experimental measurements taken with our bioimpedance device on a phantom reproducing chest tissues properties. The comparison was both qualitative and quantitative through the application of suitable figures of merit; in this way the impact of the noise of the low power front-end on the image quality was assessed. The comparison between simulation and measurement results demonstrated that, despite the limited SNR, the device is accurate enough to be used for the development of an EIT based imaging wearable system.},

STUDY DESIGN: A pilot study assessed patient's, nurse's and physician's satisfaction with and the use of the remote presence technology aiding delivery of health care to a remote community. A preliminary cost analysis of this technology was also performed.
METHODS: This study deployed a remote presence RP-7 robot to the isolated Inuit community of Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador for 15 months. The RP-7 is wirelessly controlled by a laptop computer equipped with audiovisual capability and a joystick to maneuver the robot in real time to aid in the assessing and care of patients from a distant location. Qualitative data on physician's, patient's, caregiver's and staff's satisfaction were collected as well as information on its use and characteristics and the number of air transports required to the referral center and associated costs.
RESULTS: A total of 252 remote presence sessions occurred during the study period, with 89\% of the sessions involving direct patient assessment or monitoring. Air transport was required in only 40\% of the cases that would have been otherwise transported normally. Patients and their caregivers, nurses and physicians all expressed a high level of satisfaction with the remote presence technology and deemed it beneficial for improved patient care, workloads and job satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show the feasibility of deploying a remote presence robot in a distant northern community and a high degree of satisfaction with the technology. Remote presence in the Canadian North has potential for delivering a cost-effective health care solution to underserviced communities reducing the need for the transport of patients and caregivers to distant referral centers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemedicine has been promoted by healthcare professionals as an efficient way to obtain remote assistance from specialised centres, to get a second opinion about complex diagnosis or even to share knowledge among practitioners. The current economic restrictions in many countries are increasing the demand for these solutions even more, in order to optimize processes and reduce costs. However, despite some technological solutions already in place, their adoption has been hindered by the lack of usability, especially in the set-up process.
OBJECTIVES: In this article we propose a telemedicine platform that relies on a cloud computing infrastructure and social media principles to simplify the creation of dynamic user-based groups, opening up opportunities for the establishment of teleradiology trust domains.
METHODS: The collaborative platform is provided as a Software-as-a-Service solution, supporting real time and asynchronous collaboration between users. To evaluate the solution, we have deployed the platform in a private cloud infrastructure. The system is made up of three main components - the collaborative framework, the Medical Management Information System (MMIS) and the HTML5 (Hyper Text Markup Language) Web client application - connected by a message-oriented middleware.
RESULTS: The solution allows physicians to create easily dynamic network groups for synchronous or asynchronous cooperation. The network created improves dataflow between colleagues and also knowledge sharing and cooperation through social media tools. The platform was implemented and it has already been used in two distinct scenarios: teaching of radiology and tele-reporting.
CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative systems can simplify the establishment of telemedicine expert groups with tools that enable physicians to improve their clinical practice. Streamlining the usage of this kind of systems through the adoption of Web technologies that are common in social media will increase the quality of current solutions, facilitating the sharing of clinical information, medical imaging studies and patient diagnostics among collaborators.},

The mean level of adherence for asthma medications is estimated to be as low as 22\%. Therefore, objective measurements of adherence to medicine are necessary. This virtual observational study is designed to measure the usability of an electronic monitoring device platform that measures adherence. Understanding how patients use the BreatheSmart mobile technology at home is essential to assess its feasibility as a solution to improve medication adherence. We anticipate this approach can be applied to real-world environments as a cost-effective solution to improve medication adherence.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a virtual 6-month observational study of 100 adults (≥18 years) with an asthma diagnosis, using inhaled corticosteroids for at least 3 months. Participants will be recruited in the USA through ad placements online. All participants receive wireless Bluetooth-enabled inhaler sensors that track medication usage and an mSpirometerTM capable of clinical-grade lung function measurements, and download the BreatheSmart mobile application that transmits data to a secure server. All analyses are based on an intention-to-treat. Usability is assessed by patient questionnaires and question sessions. Simple paired t-test is used to assess significant change in Asthma Control Test score, quality of life (EuroQol-5D questionnaire) and lung function.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical or safety concerns pertain to the collection of these data. Results of this research are planned to be published as soon as available.

However, they have become exceedingly expensive and complex and are not available to the economically disadvantaged majority of the world population in underdeveloped as well as developed parts of the world. For example, according to the World Health Organization about two thirds of the world population does not have access to medical imaging. In this paper we introduce a new medical technology paradigm centered on wireless technology and cloud computing that was designed to overcome the problems of increasing health technology costs. We demonstrate the value of the concept with an example; the design of a wireless, distributed network and central (cloud) computing enabled three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound system. Specifically, we demonstrate the feasibility of producing a 3-D high end ultrasound scan at a central computing facility using the raw data acquired at the remote patient site with an inexpensive low end ultrasound transducer designed for 2-D, through a mobile device and wireless connection link between them. Producing high-end 3D ultrasound images with simple low-end transducers reduces the cost of imaging by orders of magnitude. It also removes the requirement of having a highly trained imaging expert at the patient site, since the need for hand-eye coordination and the ability to reconstruct a 3-D mental image from 2-D scans, which is a necessity for high quality ultrasound imaging, is eliminated. This could enable relatively untrained medical workers in developing nations to administer imaging and a more accurate diagnosis, effectively saving the lives of people.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The implementation of a remote intensive care unit (ICU) pharmacy service in a 13-hospital health system is discussed.
SUMMARY: Significant challenges for small hospitals are timely, consistent delivery of critical care and being able to have highly experienced critical care physicians, nurses, and pharmacists available onsite within the ICU during all hours of the day. To remedy these problems, Aurora Health Care turned to telemedicine. All 246 ICU beds in the health system are connected to a remote, office-based ICU monitoring facility powered by the eICU, a telemedicine technology. The remote ICU is located in an independent facility. The staff consists of 5.2 full-time equivalent (FTE) pharmacists and 2.2 FTE pharmacy technicians and they monitor ICU patients at all of the hospitals in the system. Each remote ICU pharmacist was educated about expectations and is familiar with the different site processes and practices. All hospitals in the system were required to implement order-scanning technology to allow the remote ICU pharmacy staff to efficiently process orders. Computerized physician order entry, which results in orders being received directly by the pharmacy information system for verification, was also implemented within the system. The remote ICU pharmacists make recommendations for problems to either the hospital-based staff or the remote ICU team. Appropriate antimicrobial coverage and formulary support were the most common recommendations. Cost reduction is an important element of the remote ICU pharmacy service, but the primary motivation for implementation was to improve the quality of patient care.
CONCLUSION: Implementation of a remote ICU pharmacy service in a 13-hospital health system resulted in the provision of consistent pharmaceutical care while minimizing costs.},

	abstract = {Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has great advantages over traditional endoscopy because it is portable and easy to use, especially in remote monitoring health-services. However, during the WCE process, the large amount of captured video data demands a significant deal of computation to analyze and retrieve informative video frames. In order to facilitate efficient WCE data collection and browsing task, we present a resource- and bandwidth-aware WCE video summarization framework that extracts the representative keyframes of the WCE video contents by removing redundant and non-informative frames. For redundancy elimination, we use Jeffrey-divergence between color histograms and inter-frame Boolean series-based correlation of color channels. To remove non-informative frames, multi-fractal texture features are extracted to assist the classification using an ensemble-based classifier. Owing to the limited WCE resources, it is impossible for the WCE system to perform computationally intensive video summarization tasks. To resolve computational challenges, mobile-cloud architecture is incorporated, which provides resizable computing capacities by adaptively offloading video summarization tasks between the client and the cloud server. The qualitative and quantitative results are encouraging and show that the proposed framework saves information transmission cost and bandwidth, as well as the valuable time of data analysts in browsing remote sensing data.},

This project came about when the Health System Strategy Division at the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care subsequently asked the secretariat to provide an evidentiary platform for the Ministry's newly released Diabetes Strategy.After an initial review of the strategy and consultation with experts, the secretariat identified five key areas in which evidence was needed. Evidence-based analyses have been prepared for each of these five areas: insulin pumps, behavioural interventions, bariatric surgery, home telemonitoring, and community based care. For each area, an economic analysis was completed where appropriate and is described in a separate report.To review these titles within the Diabetes Strategy Evidence series, please visit the Medical Advisory Secretariat Web site, http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/mas\_about.html,DIABETES STRATEGY EVIDENCE PLATFORM: Summary of Evidence-Based AnalysesContinuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Pumps for Type 1 and Type 2 Adult Diabetics: An Evidence-Based AnalysisBehavioural Interventions for Type 2 Diabetes: An Evidence-Based AnalysisBARIATRIC SURGERY FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES AND MORBID OBESITY: An Evidence-Based SummaryCommunity-Based Care for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes: An Evidence-Based AnalysisHome Telemonitoring for Type 2 Diabetes: An Evidence-Based AnalysisApplication of the Ontario Diabetes Economic Model (ODEM) to Determine the Cost-effectiveness and Budget Impact of Selected Type 2 Diabetes Interventions in Ontario
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis is to review the efficacy of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pumps as compared to multiple daily injections (MDI) for the type 1 and type 2 adult diabetics.
CLINICAL NEED AND TARGET POPULATION: Insulin therapy is an integral component of the treatment of many individuals with diabetes. Type 1, or juvenile-onset diabetes, is a life-long disorder that commonly manifests in children and adolescents, but onset can occur at any age. It represents about 10\% of the total diabetes population and involves immune-mediated destruction of insulin producing cells in the pancreas. The loss of these cells results in a decrease in insulin production, which in turn necessitates exogenous insulin therapy. Type 2, or 'maturity-onset' diabetes represents about 90\% of the total diabetes population and is marked by a resistance to insulin or insufficient insulin secretion. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity. The condition tends to develop gradually and may remain undiagnosed for many years. Approximately 30\% of patients with type 2 diabetes eventually require insulin therapy.  CSII PUMPS: In conventional therapy programs for diabetes, insulin is injected once or twice a day in some combination of short- and long-acting insulin preparations. Some patients require intensive therapy regimes known as multiple daily injection (MDI) programs, in which insulin is injected three or more times a day. It's a time consuming process and usually requires an injection of slow acting basal insulin in the morning or evening and frequent doses of short-acting insulin prior to eating. The most common form of slower acting insulin used is neutral protamine gagedorn (NPH), which reaches peak activity 3 to 5 hours after injection. There are some concerns surrounding the use of NPH at night-time as, if injected immediately before bed, nocturnal hypoglycemia may occur. To combat nocturnal hypoglycemia and other issues related to absorption, alternative insulins have been developed, such as the slow-acting insulin glargine. Glargine has no peak action time and instead acts consistently over a twenty-four hour period, helping reduce the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes. Alternatively, intensive therapy regimes can be administered by continuous insulin infusion (CSII) pumps. These devices attempt to closely mimic the behaviour of the pancreas, continuously providing a basal level insulin to the body with additional boluses at meal times. Modern CSII pumps are comprised of a small battery-driven pump that is designed to administer insulin subcutaneously through the abdominal wall via butterfly needle. The insulin dose is adjusted in response to measured capillary glucose values in a fashion similar to MDI and is thus often seen as a preferred method to multiple injection therapy. There are, however, still risks associated with the use of CSII pumps. Despite the increased use of CSII pumps, there is uncertainty around their effectiveness as compared to MDI for improving glycemic control.  PART A: TYPE 1 DIABETIC ADULTS (\#ENTITYSTARTX02265;19 YEARS) An evidence-based analysis on the efficacy of CSII pumps compared to MDI was carried out on both type 1 and type 2 adult diabetic populations.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Are CSII pumps more effective than MDI for improving glycemic control in adults (≥19 years) with type 1 diabetes?Are CSII pumps more effective than MDI for improving additional outcomes related to diabetes such as quality of life (QoL)?
LITERATURE SEARCH: INCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analysis and/or health technology assessments from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHLAdults (≥ 19 years)Type 1 diabetesStudy evaluates CSII vs. MDIPublished between January 1, 2002 - March 24, 2009Patient currently on intensive insulin therapy
EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies with {\textless}20 patientsStudies {\textless}5 weeks in durationCSII applied only at night time and not 24 hours/dayMixed group of diabetes patients (children, adults, type 1, type 2)Pregnancy studies
OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: The primary outcomes of interest were glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, mean daily blood glucose, glucose variability, and frequency of hypoglycaemic events. Other outcomes of interest were insulin requirements, adverse events, and quality of life.
SEARCH STRATEGY: The literature search strategy employed keywords and subject headings to capture the concepts of: 1) insulin pumps, and 2) type 1 diabetes. The search was run on July 6, 2008 in the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE (1996 to June Week 4 2008), OVID MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE (1980 to 2008 Week 26), OVID CINAHL (1982 to June Week 4 2008) the Cochrane Library, and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination/International Agency for Health Technology Assessment. A search update was run on March 24, 2009 and studies published prior to 2002 were also examined for inclusion into the review. Parallel search strategies were developed for the remaining databases. Search results were limited to human and English-language published between January 2002 and March 24, 2009. Abstracts were reviewed, and studies meeting the inclusion criteria outlined above were obtained. Reference lists were also checked for relevant studies.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The database search identified 519 relevant citations published between 1996 and March 24, 2009. Of the 519 abstracts reviewed, four RCTs and one abstract met the inclusion criteria outlined above. While efficacy outcomes were reported in each of the trials, a meta-analysis was not possible due to missing data around standard deviations of change values as well as missing data for the first period of the crossover arm of the trial. Meta-analysis was not possible on other outcomes (quality of life, insulin requirements, frequency of hypoglycemia) due to differences in reporting.  HBA1C: In studies where no baseline data was reported, the final values were used. Two studies (Hanaire-Broutin et al. 2000, Hoogma et al. 2005) reported a slight reduction in HbA1c of 0.35\% and 0.22\% respectively for CSII pumps in comparison to MDI. A slightly larger reduction in HbA1c of 0.84\% was reported by DeVries et al.; however, this study was the only study to include patients with poor glycemic control marked by higher baseline HbA1c levels. One study (Bruttomesso et al. 2008) showed no difference between CSII pumps and MDI on Hba1c levels and was the only study using insulin glargine (consistent with results of parallel RCT in abstract by Bolli 2004). While there is statistically significant reduction in HbA1c in three of four trials, there is no evidence to suggest these results are clinically significant.  MEAN BLOOD GLUCOSE: Three of four studies reported a statistically significant reduction in the mean daily blood glucose for patients using CSII pump, though these results were not clinically significant. One study (DeVries et al. 2002) did not report study data on mean blood glucose but noted that the differences were not statistically significant. There is difficulty with interpreting study findings as blood glucose was measured differently across studies. Three of four studies used a glucose diary, while one study used a memory meter. In addition, frequency of self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) varied from four to nine times per day. Measurements used to determine differences in mean daily blood glucose between the CSII pump group and MDI group at clinic visits were collected at varying time points. Two studies use measurements from the last day prior to the final visit (Hoogma et al. 2005, DeVries et al. 2002), while one study used measurements taken during the last 30 days and another study used measurements taken during the 14 days prior to the final visit of each treatment period.  GLUCOSE VARIABILITY: All four studies showed a statistically significant reduction in glucose variability for patients using CSII pumps compared to those using MDI, though one, Bruttomesso et al. 2008, only showed a significant reduction at the morning time point.

	abstract = {Our objective was to measure direct (hospital and NHS) and indirect (patient/caregiver) costs of following up in-home compliance to non-invasive ventilation via wireless modem. We constructed a prospective controlled trial of 40 consecutive ALS home-ventilated patients, randomly assigned according to their residence area to G1 (nearby hospital, office-based follow-up) and G2 (outside hospital area, telemetry device-based follow-up). Total NHS direct cost encompassed costs related to outpatients' visits (office and emergency room) and hospitalizations. Hospital direct costs included transportation to/from hospital, office visit per hour cost and equipment maintenance. Non-medical costs considered days of wages lost due to absenteeism. G1 included 20 patients aged 60 ± 10 years and G2 included 19 patients aged 62 ± 13 years. Results showed that no differences were found regarding clinical/demographic characteristics at admission. NHS costs showed a 55\% reduction in average total costs with a statistically significant decrease of 81\% in annual costs per patient in G2. Hospital costs were found to be significantly higher in G2 with regard to total costs (64\% average increase) but not annual costs (7\%). No statistical difference was found with regard to expenses from absenteeism. In conclusion, at the cost of an initial financial constraint to the hospital per year (non-significant), telemonitoring is cost-effective, representing major cost savings to the NHS in the order of 700 euros/patient/year.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C is a major public health problem in the United States and worldwide. Outbreaks of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections associated with unsafe injection practices, drug diversion, and other exposures to blood are difficult to detect and investigate. Effective HCV outbreak investigation requires comprehensive surveillance and robust case investigation. We previously developed and validated a methodology for the rapid and cost-effective identification of HCV transmission clusters. Global Hepatitis Outbreak and Surveillance Technology (GHOST) is a cloud-based system enabling users, regardless of computational expertise, to analyze and visualize transmission clusters in an independent, accurate and reproducible way.
RESULTS: We present and explore performance of several GHOST implemented algorithms using next-generation sequencing data experimentally obtained from hypervariable region 1 of genetically related and unrelated HCV strains. GHOST processes data from an entire MiSeq run in approximately 3 h. A panel of seven specimens was used for preparation of six repeats of MiSeq libraries. Testing sequence data from these libraries by GHOST showed a consistent transmission linkage detection, testifying to high reproducibility of the system. Lack of linkage among genetically unrelated HCV strains and constant detection of genetic linkage between HCV strains from known transmission pairs and from follow-up specimens at different levels of MiSeq-read sampling indicate high specificity and sensitivity of GHOST in accurate detection of HCV transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: GHOST enables automatic extraction of timely and relevant public health information suitable for guiding effective intervention measures. It is designed as a virtual diagnostic system intended for use in molecular surveillance and outbreak investigations rather than in research. The system produces accurate and reproducible information on HCV transmission clusters for all users, irrespective of their level of bioinformatics expertise. Improvement in molecular detection capacity will contribute to increasing the rate of transmission detection, thus providing opportunity for rapid, accurate and effective response to outbreaks of hepatitis C. Although GHOST was originally developed for hepatitis C surveillance, its modular structure is readily applicable to other infectious diseases. Worldwide availability of GHOST for the detection of HCV transmissions will foster deeper involvement of public health researchers and practitioners in hepatitis C outbreak investigation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Depressive disorders are significant causes of disease burden and are associated with substantial economic costs. It is therefore important to design a healthcare system that can effectively manage depression at sustainable costs. This article computes the benefit-to-cost ratio of the current Dutch healthcare system for depression, and investigates whether offering more online preventive interventions improves the cost-effectiveness overall.
METHODS: A health economic (Markov) model was used to synthesize clinical and economic evidence and to compute population-level costs and effects of interventions. The model compared a base case scenario without preventive telemedicine and alternative scenarios with preventive telemedicine. The central outcome was the benefit-to-cost ratio, also known as return-on-investment (ROI).
RESULTS: In terms of ROI, a healthcare system with preventive telemedicine for depressive disorders offers better value for money than a healthcare system without Internet-based prevention. Overall, the ROI increases from €1.45 (\$1.72) in the base case scenario to €1.76 (\$2.09) in the alternative scenario in which preventive telemedicine is offered. In a scenario in which the costs of offering preventive telemedicine are balanced by reducing the expenditures for curative interventions, ROI increases to €1.77 (\$2.10), while keeping the healthcare budget constant.
CONCLUSIONS: For a healthcare system for depressive disorders to remain economically sustainable, its cost-benefit ratio needs to be improved. Offering preventive telemedicine at a large scale is likely to introduce such an improvement.},

DESIGN: Semistructured interview groups and quantitative survey.
SETTING: Two participating not-for-profit RACF.
PARTICIPANTS: Managers, employed carers, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, registered nurses, and residents from RACF.
MEASUREMENTS: A survey initially followed by focus groups that centered on 4 questions. How can computers help improve care? What kind of electronic services and products could help improve care? Who should have access to the technology and why was the technology not used?
RESULTS: The survey revealed there was awareness of information and communication technology (ICT) in RACF. However, respondents were uncertain of potential benefits provided to their clients. Only 43\% of respondents thought a minority of clients would receive the benefits of ICT use. The focus groups revealed several themes regarding the attitudes toward ICT in RACF. Positive attitudes to ICT included themes of saving time, easier doctor access, cost saving, and improved communications. Negative attitudes included themes of loss of human contact, inadequate training, security barriers, not user friendly, limited ability to comply with suggestions, privacy issues, and capital cost. Residents were also concerned about confidentiality and loss of human interaction with the use of Telehealth in residential aged facilities.
CONCLUSIONS: More training for staff is required to enable them to use ICT efficiently. ICT hardware and software at the user interface must be designed to maintain confidentiality with ease of access. Access to Telehealth services should not impede the routine delivery of personal care and human contact for residents. Studies are required as to where human input to residents is unable to be replaced by Telehealth services.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nurse-supported shared care services for patients living with hepatitis C have been implemented in some regional areas of Western Australia to provide access to local treatment and care services for patients and to improve currently low levels of treatment uptake. This study collected data from health professionals involved in managing the care of patients living with hepatitis C and from patients engaged in regional nurse-supported hepatitis C shared care services in Western Australia.
METHODS: Key informant qualitative interviews were conducted with health professionals in regions operating a nurse-supported shared care service and in regions without this service. Patients engaged in the shared care program at the time of the study were invited to complete a short questionnaire.
RESULTS: Nurse-supported shared care services reduced patient transport costs to tertiary centres, accelerated access to treatment and delivered {\textgreater}98\% compliance with treatment schedules. Patients engaged with regional hepatitis C shared care services expressed high levels of satisfaction and indicated that they would delay treatment if it was not available locally. Telehealth support from tertiary liver clinics and allied health services were available to health professionals engaged in regional shared care services and were used effectively. There was limited participation by general practitioners in regional hepatitis C shared care services and regional patients' access to treatment was influenced by the availability and capacity of health professionals. Uptake of treatment and engagement in the regional shared care program was limited for Aboriginal people and younger people although these groups had the highest rates of hepatitis C notifications in Western Australia.
DISCUSSION: The patients consulted for this study preferred to access hepatitis C treatment and care locally rather than travel to tertiary liver clinics, up to 1500 kilometres away. The reasons for limited engagement in the shared care program by some groups with high rates of hepatitis C notifications requires further investigation. Health professionals identified several benefits of the shared care program including continuity of care for patients, shorter waiting times, longer appointment times and high levels of treatment compliance.
CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis nurses in regional areas can coordinate effective patient treatment and care when supported by treatment protocols and access to physicians and liver specialists, including through telehealth. Treatment and care options to suit individual preferences are required to avoid further stigmatising marginalised groups. The role of primary care in facilitating hepatitis C treatment uptake should be explored further including strategies for improving the participation of general practitioners in regional shared care services.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the cost-constrained NHS and in the quest for rapid diagnosis, teledermatology is a tool that can be used within general practice to aid in the diagnosis of benign-looking skin lesions and reduce referrals to secondary care. The setting for the study was a single general practice of 6500 patients in suburban Greater London. The aim of the study was to determine: (1) whether teledermatology in a single general practice is cost-effective, (2) whether the correct types of cases are being referred, and (3) if patients are satisfied with the service.
METHODS: Teledermatology was provided by a private provider. A trained member of staff took photographs in the practice. A consultant dermatologist carried out reporting. This is a retrospective analysis of case records over three years. The cases were adult patients (aged 18+) using teledermatology for the diagnosis and management of skin lesions thought to be benign by the general practitioner. Cost-effectiveness was calculated by considering savings made through reduced referral to secondary care, taking into account the cost of the service. To evaluate whether the correct cases were referred we reviewed whether the assessing dermatologist identified any previously undiagnosed skin cancer. Patient satisfaction assessment was performed using a standard questionnaire.
RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-eight patients had teledermatology. These were patients who would have been referred to secondary care for a routine appointment. Of these, 102 were subsequently referred to secondary care and 146 were managed within the practice. Teledermatology saved £12 460 over the 3-year period. Patients were followed for up to 51 months and no lesions were found to be malignant. Ninety-seven percent of patients rated themselves as satisfied/very satisfied and 93\% found the procedure comfortable/very comfortable. The median wait for the photos to be taken was 7 days, and 1-2 weeks for results.
CONCLUSIONS: Teledermatology has been shown to be cost-effective, with referrals identified correctly when employed in this general practice setting. Satisfaction with the service was high.},

	abstract = {Telemedicine has been successfully used in many areas of medicine, including triage and evaluation of the acute burn patient. The utility of telemedicine during the rehabilitative phase of burn care has yet to be evaluated; therefore, we expanded our telemedicine program to link our burn center with a rehabilitation facility. The goal of this project was to demonstrate cost-effective improvements in the transition and quality of care. A retrospective review was performed on all patients enrolled in our telemedicine/rehabilitation program between March 2013 and March 2014. Data collected included total number of encounters, visits, type of visit, physician time, and readmissions. Transportation costs were based on local ambulance rates between the two facilities. The impact of telemedicine was evaluated with respect to the time saved for the physician, burn center, and burn clinic, as well as rehabilitative days saved. A patient satisfaction survey was also administered. A total of 29 patients participated in 73 virtual visits through the telemedicine project. Virtual visits included new consults, preoperative evaluations, and postoperative follow-ups. A total of 146 ambulance transports were averted during the study period, totaling \$101,110. Virtual visits saved 6.8 outpatient burn clinic days, or 73 clinic appointments of 30-min duration. The ability to perform more outpatient surgery resulted in 80 inpatient bed days saved at the burn hospital. The rehabilitation hospital saved an average of 2 to 3 patient days secondary to unnecessary travel. Satisfaction surveys demonstrated patient satisfaction with the encounters, primarily related to time saved. The decrease in travel time for the patient from the rehabilitation hospital to outpatient burn clinic improved adherence to the rehabilitation care plan and resulted in increased throughput at the rehabilitation facility. Videoconferencing between a burn center and rehabilitation hospital streamlined patient care and reduced health care costs, while maintaining quality of care and patient satisfaction. This program has improved inpatient burn rehabilitation by maximizing time spent in therapy and avoiding unnecessary patient travel to offsite appointments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current cancer management faces several challenges, including the occurrence of a residual tumor after resection, the use of radioactive materials or high concentrations of blue dyes for sentinel lymph node biopsy, and the use of bulky systems in surgical suites for image guidance. To overcome these limitations, we developed a real-time, intraoperative imaging device that, when combined with near infrared fluorescent molecular probes, can aid in the identification of tumor margins, guide surgical resections, map sentinel lymph nodes, and transfer acquired data wirelessly for remote analysis.
METHODS: We developed a new compact, wireless, wearable, and battery-operated device that allows for hands-free operation by surgeons. A charge-coupled device-based, consumer-grade night vision viewer was used to develop the detector portion of the device, and the light source portion was developed from a compact headlamp. This piece was retrofitted to provide both near infrared excitation and white light illumination simultaneously. Wireless communication was enabled by integrating a battery-operated, miniature, radio-frequency video transmitter into the system. We applied the device in several types of oncologic surgical procedures in murine models, including sentinel lymph node mapping, fluorescence-guided tumor resection, and surgery under remote expert guidance.
RESULTS: Unlike conventional imaging instruments, the device displays fluorescence information directly on its eyepiece. When employed in sentinel lymph node mapping, the locations of sentinel lymph nodes were visualized clearly, even with tracer level dosing of a near infrared fluorescent dye (indocyanine green). When used in tumor resection, tumor margins and small nodules invisible to the naked eye were visualized readily. In a simulated, point-of-care setting, tumors were located successfully and removed under remote guidance using the wireless feature of the device. Importantly, the total cost of this prototype system (\$1200) is substantially less than existing imaging instruments.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using the new device to aid surgical resection of tumors, map sentinel lymph nodes, and facilitate telemedicine.},

	abstract = {Home-based exacerbation management programs have been proposed as an approach to reducing the clinical and financial burden of COPD. We demonstrate a framework to evaluate such programs in order to guide program design and performance decisions towards optimizing cost and clinical outcomes. This study models the impact of hypothetical exacerbation management programs through probabilistic Markov simulations. Patients were stratified by risk using exacerbation rates from the ECLIPSE study and expert opinion. Three scenarios were modeled, using base, worst and best case parameters to suggest potential telehealth program performance. In these scenarios, acute exacerbations could be detected early, with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 60-90\%. Detected acute exacerbations could be diverted to either a sub-acute pathway (12.5-50\% probability), thus entirely avoiding hospitalization, or a lower cost pathway through length-of-stay reduction (14-28\% reduction). For a cohort of patients without prior hospitalization, the base case telehealth scenario results in a cumulative per-patient lifetime savings of \$2.9 K over ≈ 12 years. For a higher risk cohort of patients with a prior admission and 1 to 2 acute exacerbations per year, a cumulative \$16K per patient was saved during the remaining ≈ 3 life-years. Acceptable prices for home-based exacerbation detection testing were highly dependent on patient risk and scenario, but ranged from \$290-\$1263 per month for the highest risk groups. These results suggest the economic viability of exacerbation management programs and highlight the importance of risk stratification in such programs. The presented model can further be adapted to model specific programs as trial data becomes available.},

This study assesses clinical and economic consequences of providing telehealth programs for CHF patients. A Markov model was developed and presented in the context of a home-based telehealth program on CHF. Incremental life expectancy, hospital admissions, and total healthcare costs were examined at periods ranging up to five years. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses were also conducted on clinical performance parameters. The base case analysis yielded cost savings ranging from \$2832 to \$5499 and 0.03 to 0.04 life year gain per patient over a 1-year period. Applying telehealth solution to a low-risk cohort with no prior admission history would result in \$2502 cost increase per person over the 1-year time frame with 0.01 life year gain. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the cost savings were most sensitive to patient risk, baseline cost of hospital admission, and the length-of-stay reduction ratio affected by the telehealth programs. In sum, telehealth programs can be cost saving for intermediate and high risk patients over a 1- to 5-year window. The results suggested the economic viability of telehealth programs for managing CHF patients and illustrated the importance of risk stratification in such programs.},

	abstract = {The health care sector has become increasingly interested in developing personal health record (PHR) systems as an Internet-based telehealthcare implementation to improve the quality and decrease the cost of care. However, the factors that influence patients' intention to use PHR systems remain unclear. Based on physicians' therapeutic expertise, we implemented a web-based infertile PHR system and proposed an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that integrates the physician-patient relationship (PPR) construct into TAM's original perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU) constructs to explore which factors will influence the behavioral intentions (BI) of infertile patients to use the PHR. From ninety participants from a medical center, 50 valid responses to a self-rating questionnaire were collected, yielding a response rate of 55.56\%. The partial least squares (PLS) technique was used to assess the causal relationships that were hypothesized in the extended model. The results indicate that infertile patients expressed a moderately high intention to use the PHR system. The PPR and PU of patients had significant effects on their BI to use PHR, whereas the PEOU indirectly affected the patients' BI through the PU. This investigation confirms that PPR can have a critical role in shaping patients' perceptions of the use of healthcare information technologies. Hence, we suggest that hospitals should promote the potential usefulness of PHR and improve the quality of the physician-patient relationship to increase patients' intention of using PHR.},

	abstract = {Early identification of diabetic foot complications and their precursors is essential in preventing their devastating consequences, such as foot infection and amputation. Frequent, automatic risk assessment by an intelligent telemedicine system might be feasible and cost effective. Infrared thermography is a promising modality for such a system. The temperature differences between corresponding areas on contralateral feet are the clinically significant parameters. This asymmetric analysis is hindered by (1) foot segmentation errors, especially when the foot temperature and the ambient temperature are comparable, and by (2) different shapes and sizes between contralateral feet due to deformities or minor amputations. To circumvent the first problem, we used a color image and a thermal image acquired synchronously. Foot regions, detected in the color image, were rigidly registered to the thermal image. This resulted in 97.8\% ± 1.1\% sensitivity and 98.4\% ± 0.5\% specificity over 76 high-risk diabetic patients with manual annotation as a reference. Nonrigid landmark-based registration with B-splines solved the second problem. Corresponding points in the two feet could be found regardless of the shapes and sizes of the feet. With that, the temperature difference of the left and right feet could be obtained.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of telemedicine in the diagnosis and treatment of acute stroke, or telestroke, is a well-accepted method of practice improving geographic disparities in timely access to neurological expertise. We propose that mobile telestroke assessment during ambulance transport is feasible using low-cost, widely available technology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a platform including a tablet-based end point, high-speed modem with commercial wireless access, external antennae, and portable mounting apparatus. Mobile connectivity testing was performed along six primary ambulance routes in a rural network. Audiovisual (AV) quality was assessed simultaneously by both an in-vehicle and an in-hospital rater using a standardized 6-point rating scale (≥4 indicating feasibility). We sought to achieve 9 min of continuous AV connectivity presumed sufficient to perform mobile telestroke assessments.
RESULTS: Thirty test runs were completed: 93\% achieved a minimum of 9 min of continuous video transmission with a mean mobile connectivity time of 18 min. Mean video and audio quality ratings were 4.51 (4.54 vehicle; 4.48 hospital) and 5.00 (5.13 in-vehicle; 4.87 hospital), respectively. Total initial cost of the system was \$1,650 per ambulance.
CONCLUSIONS: In this small, single-centered study we maintained high-quality continuous video transmission along primary ambulance corridors using a low-cost mobile telemedicine platform. The system is designed to be portable and adaptable, with generalizability for rapid assessment of emergency conditions in which direct observational exam may improve prehospital diagnosis and treatment. Thus mobile telestroke assessment is feasible using low-cost components and commercial wireless connectivity. More research is needed to demonstrate clinical reliability and efficacy in a live-patient setting.},

METHODS: We compared data on the outcomes and costs for implementing evidence-based ABA procedures to reduce problem behavior by using 3 service delivery models: in-home therapy, clinic-based telehealth, and home-based telehealth. Participants were 107 young children diagnosed with autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders, and data analysis focused on the 94 children who completed treatment.
RESULTS: All 3 service delivery models demonstrated successful reduction of problem behavior by training parents to conduct functional analysis and functional communication training. The mean percentage reduction in problem behavior was {\textgreater}90\% in all 3 groups after treatment, and treatment acceptability based on parent ratings was high for all groups. Total costs for implementing treatment were lowest for home telehealth, but both telehealth models were significantly less costly than in-home therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated that parents can use ABA procedures to successfully treat behavior problems associated with autism spectrum disorders regardless of whether treatment is directed by behavior consultants in person or via remote video coaching. Because ABA telehealth can achieve similar outcomes at lower cost compared with in-home therapy, geographic barriers to providing access to ABA for treating problem behavior can be minimized. These findings support the potential for using telehealth to provide research-based behavioral treatment to any family that has access to the Internet.},

Support programs are available to mitigate the strain of care, but caregivers report access challenges (e.g., distance). STAR-C is an evidence-based, effective, one-on-one caregiver educational intervention. However, family caregivers who do not live near a STAR-C consultant (e.g., rural caregivers) cannot participate in the program. The earth-bound mode presents a critical barrier to widely-available caregiver support.
Objectives: We assessed the feasibility, preliminary efficacy, and cost of implementing a caregiver support intervention (STAR-C-Telemedicine), using Internet-based videoconferencing.
Design: Using a mixed-methods approach, we examined feasibility and pre- and post-intervention changes in caregiver burden. Focus groups provided feedback on program acceptability.
Setting: Participants, in their own homes, connected the university-based study staff using videoconferencing technology.
Participants: Twenty family caregivers for those with dementia consented to the study.
Intervention: The STAR-C-TM intervention included 8 weekly sessions in which the universitybased consultant met (via videoconferencing) with caregivers in their homes. The intervention focused on identifying upsetting behaviors and identifying triggers to the behaviors.
Measurements: We assessed caregiver burden, depression and desire to institutionalize prior to and after the intervention.
Results: Fourteen caregivers (82\% of those who started the intervention) completed all study components. We found statistically significant reductions in caregiver burden. Caregivers liked the videoconferencing option. Almost two-thirds reported, given the choice, that they would prefer it over an in-person offering. STAR-C-TM saved, on average, \$1150/per caregiver over the traditional program. Qualitative findings supported the quantitative data.
Conclusions: Telemedicine-based support for family caregivers is a feasible and cost-effective option. As the prevalence of dementia grows, programs such as STAR-C-TM can fill an important gap in caregiver education and support.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) with cytology preparations plays a critical role in minimally invasive procedures. The time spent by a pathologist performing ROSE is unpredictable and could be used for more cost-effective activities. The solution encountered by several institutions to address this issue is the use of telecytology (TC). This study analyzes the experience of using telecytology for ROSE in a major cancer center over a period of over 2 years.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all remote TC evaluations for adequacy on fine needle aspiration (FNA) and touch preparations (TP) of core biopsies (CB) performed at a major cancer center was performed. The preliminary adequacy assessment was then compared to the adequacy assessment at final diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 12 949 adequacy assessments were analyzed. The most common sites biopsied in our institution were lymph node, lung, and liver. There were 7725 adequacy assessments for CB (59.7\%), while adequacy assessment for FNA specimens represented 40.3\% (n = 5224) of the total number of specimens evaluated by ROSE. Perfect concordance between initial adequacy assessment and the adequacy assessment at final cytologic diagnosis was 93\% (12 049/12 949). The final diagnosis adequacy upgrade rate was 6.7\% (n = 863), and the adequacy downgrade (a specimen considered adequate on-site that was determined to be nondiagnostic on final examination) was 0.3\% (n = 37).
CONCLUSIONS: TC can be easily implemented with the current technologies available. It is cost-effective and allows for better patient care with a more efficient use of the pathologist's time and laboratory resources.},

	abstract = {Introduction The objective of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with varicose veins managed in the telemedicine clinic and traditional clinic. Methods Retrospective analysis of all vein procedures in the institutional Vascular Quality Initiative Varicose Vein Registry (VQI VVR) was performed from January 2015 to August 2017. Patients were divided into two groups: Telemedicine versus Traditional Clinic. Comparison data included patient demographics, past medical history, clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcomes and postoperative complications. Statistical testing included chi-square test for categorical variables and student t-test for continuous variables using the SPSS statistical software. Results A total of 1034 varicose vein procedures were performed during the 31-month study period. There were 75 virtual encounters in the Telemedicine Clinic (Group A) and 959 face-to-face encounters in the Traditional Clinic (Group B). Most of the demographics characteristics were clinically similar in both groups. Comparing Group A and Group B, there were no differences in age, sex, race and body mass index. Early 3-month follow up was 100\% in Group A and 90.7\% in Group B. Both groups had low complication rates of haematoma (1.3\% vs 0.3\%, p = 0.884), paraesthesia (1.3\% vs 0.6\%, p = 0.767) and recanalisation (1.3\% vs 4.0\%, p = 0.383) during the early follow up period. Discussion Synchronous virtual visits for patient care are feasible for the management of chronic venous disease. Patients with varicose veins who choose to undergo telemedicine evaluations have similar pre-operative demographics, clinical classification and patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Expert systems have been widely used in medical and healthcare practice for various purposes. In addition to vital sign data, important concerns in telehealthcare include the compliance with the measurement prescription, the accuracy of vital sign measurements, and the functioning of vital sign meters and home gateways. However, few expert system applications are found in the telehealthcare domain to address these issues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article presents an expert system application for one of the largest commercialized telehealthcare practices in Taiwan by Min-Sheng General Hospital. The main function of the Telehealthcare Expert System (TES) developed in this research is to detect and classify events based on the measurement data transmitted to the database at the call center, including abnormality of vital signs, violation of vital sign measurement prescriptions, and malfunction of hardware devices (home gateway and vital sign meter). When the expert system detects an abnormal event, it assigns an "urgent degree" and alerts the nursing team in the call center to take action, such as phoning the patient for counseling or to urge the patient to return to the hospital for further tests.
RESULTS: During 2 years of clinical practice, from 2009 to 2011, 19,182 patients were served by the expert system. The expert system detected 41,755 events, of which 22.9\% indicated abnormality of vital signs, 75.2\% indicated violation of measurement prescription, and 1.9\% indicated malfunction of devices. On average, the expert system reduced by 76.5\% the time that the nursing team in the call center spent in handling the events.
CONCLUSIONS: The expert system helped to reduce cost and improve quality of the telehealthcare service.},

METHODS: A review of the first year of the Health Experts onLine at Portsmouth system was performed. Data on each teleconsultation were extracted from the Health Experts onLine at Portsmouth system database and analyzed.
RESULTS: From June 2014 to May 2015 there have been 585 teleconsultations. Providers stationed on 36 ships/submarines and at 28 remote military treatment facilities have utilized the Health Experts onLine at Portsmouth system. Over 280 specialists in 34 different specialties were consulted. The median time to first response from a specialist was 6 h and 8 min, with 75\% of all consults being addressed within 24 h. Eighteen medevacs were recommended. Thirty-nine potential medevacs were prevented, and 100 potential civilian network deferrals were prevented, resulting in an estimated savings of over US\$580,000.
DISCUSSION: Based on the 1-year metrics, Health Experts onLine at Portsmouth has provided improved access and quality of care to service members and their families throughout the Navy Medicine East Region. It has helped avoid over US\$580,000 in unnecessary cost burden. Further review at the 2-year time interval will demonstrate the continued growth and effectiveness of the Health Experts onLine at Portsmouth system.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health Experts onLine at Portsmouth (HELP) is a web-based teleconsultation system launched in June 2014 to facilitate communication between specialists at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth and providers assigned to both the fleet forces and primary care clinics across the eastern United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Specialist consultations through the HELP system purport to improve access to care for patients who otherwise might be referred to the civilian network or medically evacuated (MEDEVACed) to Naval Medical Center Portsmouth for specialized care. If HELP-facilitated communications help avoid civilian referrals or MEDEVACs, the associated costs of that care should be reduced.
METHODS: We evaluated cost savings associated with prevented MEDEVACs by analyzing both tangible savings (prevented costs of flights, per diems, and consults) and intangible savings (reduced lost productivity time). We compared these savings to the costs of maintaining and utilizing the HELP system: startup costs, administrative costs, and provider time costs. We used patient and provider data from the HELP database to evaluate clinical consult cases. Before this analysis, a panel of 3 physicians associated with HELP reviewed each consult to determine whether a case qualified as a prevented MEDEVAC. Data from the Military Health System (MHS) Management and Analysis Reporting Tool and the MHS Data Repository were used to estimate costs associated with provider time, patient time, and direct care medical encounters.
FINDINGS: The HELP program delivered measurable, positive returns on investment (ROIs) between June 2014 and December 2015. In that time frame, 559 consult cases occurred in the HELP system. Of the 559 total consult cases, 50 consults prevented MEDEVACs. Incorporating only tangible savings, HELP produced an 80\% ROI on the basis of prevented medical evacuations; the addition of intangible savings such as reduced lost productivity increased the ROI to 250\%. The dollar values of these savings were \$693,461 and \$1,337,628, respectively.
IMPACT: The HELP program produces considerable savings (both tangible and intangible) to the Military Healthcare System for small costs. It does this both by increasing access to care at previously inaccessibly remote medical treatment facilities and by consequently decreasing the forward provider's reliance on medical evacuation in questionable cases. This positive ROI was potentially underestimated as this analysis did not account for recapture of care that would otherwise have been sent to the civilian market. On the basis of this analysis, a low bandwidth, asynchronous, and internet accessible teleconsultation system is both a feasible and effective means of projecting quality care forward into the deployed setting. Future implementation of similar initiatives throughout the MHS can be expected, and will likely draw from the lessons learned during the successful implementation and execution of the HELP system.},

Recently, interest in power quality in electrical distribution systems has increased rapidly. In Korea, the communication network to deliver voltage, current, and temperature measurements gathered from pole transformers to remote monitoring centers employs cellular mobile technology. Due to high cost of the cellular mobile technology, power quality monitoring measurements are limited and data gathering intervals are large. This causes difficulties in providing the power quality monitoring service. To alleviate the problems, in this paper we present a communication infrastructure to provide low cost, reliable data delivery. The communication infrastructure consists of wired connections between substations and monitoring centers, and wireless connections between pole transformers and substations. For the wireless connection, we employ a wireless sensor network and design its corresponding data forwarding protocol to improve the quality of data delivery. For the design, we adopt a tree-based data forwarding protocol in order to customize the distribution pattern of the power quality information. We verify the performance of the proposed data forwarding protocol quantitatively using the NS-2 network simulator.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: ICU telemedicine improves access to high-quality critical care, has substantial costs, and can change financial outcomes. Detailed information about financial outcomes and their trends over time following ICU telemedicine implementation and after the addition of logistic center function has not been published to our knowledge.
METHODS: Primary data were collected for consecutive adult patients of a single academic medical center. We compared clinical and financial outcomes across three groups that differed regarding telemedicine support: a group without ICU telemedicine support (pre-ICU intervention group), a group with ICU telemedicine support (ICU telemedicine group), and an ICU telemedicine group with added logistic center functions and support for quality-care standardization (logistic center group). The primary outcome was annual direct contribution margin defined as aggregated annual case revenue minus annual case direct costs (including operating costs of ICU telemedicine and its related programs). All monetary values were adjusted to 2015 US dollars using Producer Price Index for Health-Care Facilities.
RESULTS: Annual case volume increased from 4,752 (pre-ICU telemedicine) to 5,735 (ICU telemedicine) and 6,581 (logistic center). The annual direct contribution margin improved from \$7,921,584 (pre-ICU telemedicine) to \$37,668,512 (ICU telemedicine) to \$60,586,397 (logistic center) due to increased case volume, higher case revenue relative to direct costs, and shorter length of stay.
CONCLUSIONS: The ability of properly modified ICU telemedicine programs to increase case volume and access to high-quality critical care with improved annual direct contribution margins suggests that there is a financial argument to encourage the wider adoption of ICU telemedicine.},

	issn = {0010-6178},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the cost benefit analysis of using a telemedicine-based digital retinal imaging evaluation compared to conventional ophthalmologic fundus examination of diabetic patients for diabetic retinopathy.
METHODS: In this study, diabetic patients from Community Health Center, Inc. (CHCI), a large multi-site Federally Qualified Health Center) were evaluated by teleophthalmology using the Canon CR-1 nonmydriatic fundus camera. Digital images were acquired in the CHCI offices and saved on the EyePACS server network. The images were later evaluated by retinal specialists at the Yale Eye Center, Yale University Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science. The costs for the standard of care ophthalmic examinations were calculated based on 2009 Medicaid reimbursement rates. The process of telemedicine-based diagnosis was based on a take-store-forward-visualize system. The cost of telemedicine-based digital retinal imaging examination included cost for devices, training, annual costs and a transportation fee. Current Medicaid reimbursement, transportation, and staff labor costs were used to calculate the conventional retinal examination cost as a comparison.
RESULTS: Among the 611 patients digital retinal images screened in the first year of this program and for whom data are available, 166 (27.2\%) cases of diabetic retinopathy were identified. Seventy-five (12.3\%) patients screened positive with clinically significant disease and were referred for further ophthalmological evaluation and treatment. The primary direct cost of the telemedicine was \$3.80, \$15.00, \$17.60, \$1.50, and \$2.50 per patient for medical assistant, ophthalmologist, capital cost (Equipment + Training), equipment maintenance, and transportation fee, respectively. The total cost in the telemedicine-based digital retinal imaging and evaluation was \$40.40. The cost of conventional retinal examination was \$8.70, \$65.30, and \$3.80 per patients for round-trip transportation, 2009 national Medicaid Physician Fee Schedule allowable for bilateral eye examination, and medical assistant personnel, respectively. The total costs of conventional fundus examination were \$77.80. An additional conventional ophthalmologic retinal examination was required for 75 (12.3\%) patients with clinically significant disease on telemedicine evaluation, which involves an averaged additional cost of \$ 9.55 per patient for all the patients in the study. If the cost of subsequent examination was added, the total cost of telemedicine-based digital fundus imaging was \$49.95 per patient in our group of 611 patients evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: Our cost analysis indicates that telemedicine-based diabetic retinopathy screening cost less (\$49.95 vs \$77.80) than conventional retinal examination and the telemedicine-based digital retinal imaging examination has the potential to provide an alternative method with greater convenience and access for the remote and indigent populations. Diabetes mellitus and diabetic retinopathy are growing problems in the United States and worldwide. Large scale adoption of telemedicine should be encouraged as a means toward providing improved access, increasing compliance with annual evaluation, at a low cost for patients with diabetes with direct access to an eye care specialist.},

The cases were first examined by 4 pathologists at different levels of experience with dynamic telepathology. Cases were then reviewed by the same pathologists using light microscopy in a blinded fashion 3 weeks to 2 months later. A diagnosis, together with reading times for telepathology and light microscopy, was recorded for each case. Diagnostic accuracy by telepathology was 94.8\% (569/600), 93.3\% (560/600), 91.6\% (550/600), and 97\% (388/400) for pathologists A, B, C, and D, respectively. Telepathologic diagnosis was concordant with the gold standard and with direct microscopy, with a mean of 94.2\% and 99.26\%, respectively. Most cases (510 or 85\%) were diagnosed in 15 to 40 minutes by telepathology, with a mean of 17.0 minutes. The time needed to review a slide by telepathology was 3 to 4 times longer than that of standard light microscopy. All 4 pathologists were able to render a diagnosis in all cases. Our results showed that robotic telepathology is sufficiently accurate for primary diagnosis in surgical pathology, but modifications in laboratory protocols, telepathology hardware, and internet speed are needed to reduce the time necessary for diagnosis by telepathology before this method may be deemed suitable for use in a busy practice.},

However, these methods usually require either well-controlled environments for the TUG video recording or information from special devices, such as wearable inertial sensors, ambient sensors, or depth cameras. In this paper, an automatic TUG sub-task segmentation method using video-based activity classification is proposed and validated in a study with 24 Parkinson's disease patients. Videos used in this paper are recorded in semi-controlled environments with various backgrounds. The state-of-the-art deep learning-base 2-D human pose estimation technologies are used for feature extraction. A support vector machine and a long short-term memory network are then used for the activity classification and the subtask segmentation. Our method can be used to automatically acquire clinical parameters for the assessment of Parkinson's disease using TUG videos-only, leading to the possibility of remote monitoring of the patients' condition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) require regular follow-up to manage their care, which requires significant amount of time and out-of-pocket costs. Telemedicine in the form of video virtual visits could serve as an alternative to in-office visits. The aim of this project was to understand if telemedicine can provide high value care (defined as quality/cost) to outpatients with IBD.
METHODS: Patients who participated in the IBD telemedicine clinic in the second half of 2015 were included. Patient-reported survey data before and after the virtual visit were collected. A retrospective review was performed on the study cohort for quality outcome measures a year before and after starting the telemedicine clinic. Outcomes were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics. Differences in quality outcomes were compared using odds ratios.
RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included in the analysis. Most patients travel more than 25 miles each way, take half a day off, and on average incur an additional out-of-pocket cost of \$62 for an in-office visit. Most patients (98\%) agreed that there was enough time spent with their physician, 91\% agreed that they felt like the physician understood their disease state, and 78\% reported that they clearly understood the follow-up plan after the visit. Analysis of quality outcome measures did not show any drop in the overall quality of care, after initiating the telemedicine program.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine offers a low cost and convenient alternative for patients with IBD without compromising quality of care.},

Bone Health Extension for Community Health Care Outcomes (TeleECHO) is a strategy using real-time ongoing videoconferencing technology to mentor health care professionals in rural and underserved communities to achieve an advanced level of knowledge for the care of patients with skeletal diseases. Over the first 21 months of weekly Bone Health TeleECHO programs, there were 263 registered health care professionals in the United States and several other countries, with 221 attending at least 1 online clinic and typically 35 to 40 attendees at each session at the end of the reported period. Assessment of self-confidence in 20 domains of osteoporosis care showed substantial improvement with the ECHO intervention (P = 0.005). Bone Health TeleECHO can contribute to mitigating the crisis in osteoporosis care by leveraging scarce resources, providing motivated practitioners with skills to provide better skeletal health care, closer to home, with greater convenience, and lower cost than referral to a specialty center. Bone Health TeleECHO can be replicated in any location worldwide to reach anyone with Internet access, allowing access in local time zones and languages. The ECHO model of learning can be applied to other aspects of bone care, including the education of fracture liaison service coordinators, residents and fellows, and physicians with an interest in rare bone diseases.},

Targeting interventions to patients who are most likely to benefit should improve their efficiency and clinical impact. This study aims to test the impact of three cost-equivalent pharmacist-led interventions on insulin persistence and glycaemic control among patients with diabetes.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: TARGIT-Diabetes (Targeted Adherence Intervention to Reach Glycemic Control with Insulin Therapy for patients with Diabetes) is a randomised controlled trial that will evaluate three different multifaceted pharmacist-outreach strategies for improving long-term insulin use among individuals with diabetes. We will randomise 6000 patients in a large insurer to one of three arms. The arms are designed to deliver an increasingly intensive intervention to a progressively targeted population, identified using predictive analytics. The central component of the intervention in all arms is a tailored telephone consultation with a pharmacist which varies across arms based on the: (A) proportion of patients offered the intervention and (B) intervention intensity, including follow-up frequency and cointerventions such as text reminders and interactions with patients' providers. The primary outcome is insulin persistence, assessed using pharmacy claims data, and the secondary outcomes are glycaemic control as measured by glycosylated haemoglobin values, healthcare utilisation and healthcare spending.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Privacy Board of Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey. We plan to present the results of this trial at national meetings and in manuscripts submitted to peer-reviewed journals.

	abstract = {Introduction Peritoneal dialysis is a home-based therapy for individuals with end-stage renal disease. Telehealth, especially remote monitoring, is making inroads in managing this cohort. Methods We examined whether daily remote biometric monitoring (RBM) of blood pressure and weight among peritoneal dialysis patients was associated with changes in hospitalization rate and hospital length of stay, as well as outpatient, inpatient and overall cost of care. Results Outpatient visit claim payment amounts (in US dollars derived from CMS data) decreased post-intervention relative to pre-intervention for those at age 18-54 years. For certain subgroups, non- or nearly-significant changes were found among female and Black participants. There was no change in inpatient costs post-intervention relative to pre-intervention for females and while the overall visit claim payment amounts increased in the outpatient setting slightly (US\$511.41 (1990.30) vs. US\$652.61 (2319.02), p = 0.0783) and decreased in the inpatient setting (US\$10,835.30 (6488.66) vs. US\$10,678.88 (15,308.17), p = 0.4588), these differences were not statistically significant. Overall cost was lower if RBM was used for assessment of blood pressure and/or weight (US\$-734.51, p {\textless} 0.05). Use of RBM collected weight was associated with fewer hospitalizations (adjusted odds ratio 0.54, 95\% confidence interval 0.33-0.89) and fewer days hospitalized (adjusted odds ratio 0.46, 95\% confidence interval 0.26-0.81). Use of RBM collected blood pressure was associated with increased days of hospitalization and increased odds of hospitalization. Conclusions RBM offers a powerful opportunity to provide care to those receiving home therapies such as peritoneal dialysis. RBM may be associated with reduction in both inpatient and outpatient costs for specific sub-groups receiving peritoneal dialysis.},

Telemedicine is the use of electronic communications for the exchange of medical information from one site to another to improve a patient's clinical health status.Several studies show that, by providing better patient oversight and communication, telehealth in PD enhances patient care, outcomes, quality of care, and satisfaction. Associated benefits include increased patient retention to home dialysis, reduced use of hospital services, and reduced costs of care.The sustainability of telehealth had been limited by reimbursement and regulatory restrictions. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) limited services related to end-stage renal disease by providing reimbursement for telehealth only in rural areas or counties outside of a metropolitan statistical area. Moreover, the dialysis facility and the patient's home were not approved as originating sites. However, effective January 1, 2019, those restrictions will be lifted. Telehealth will require that home dialysis patients be established with 3 initial face-to-face monthly clinical assessments without the use of telehealth; after those initial 3 months, a face-to-face visit at least once every 3 consecutive months will be required. Claims can be submitted using designated Current Procedural Terminology codes and modifiers.The actual extension of telehealth to home dialysis patients will depend on the details of forthcoming CMS regulations.},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.4716},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes patients are usually started on a low dose of insulin and their dose is adjusted or "titrated" according to their blood glucose levels. Insulin titration administered through face-to-face visits with a clinician can be time consuming and logistically burdensome for patients, especially those of low socioeconomic status (SES). Given the wide use of mobile phones among this population, there is the potential to use short message service (SMS) text messaging and phone calls to perform insulin titration remotely.
OBJECTIVE: The goals of this pilot study were to (1) evaluate if our Mobile Insulin Titration Intervention (MITI) intervention using text messaging and phone calls was effective in helping patients reach their optimal insulin glargine dose within 12 weeks, (2) assess the feasibility of the intervention within our clinic setting and patient population, (3) collect data on the cost savings associated with the intervention, and (4) measure patient satisfaction with the intervention.
METHODS: This was a pilot study evaluating an intervention for patients requiring insulin glargine titration in the outpatient medical clinic of Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City. Patients in the intervention arm received weekday SMS text messages from a health management platform requesting their fasting blood glucose values. The clinic's diabetes nurse educator monitored the texted responses on the platform website each weekday for alarm values. Once a week, the nurse reviewed the glucose values, consulted the MITI titration algorithm, and called patients to adjust their insulin dose. Patients in the usual care arm continued to receive their standard clinic care for insulin titration. The primary outcome was whether a patient reached his/her optimal insulin glargine dose within 12 weeks.
RESULTS: A total of 61 patients consented and were randomized into the study. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the intervention arm reached their optimal insulin glargine dose than patients in the usual care arm (88\%, 29/33 vs 37\%, 10/27; P{\textless}.001). Patients responded to 84.3\% (420/498) of the SMS text messages requesting their blood glucose values. The nurse reached patients within 2 attempts or by voicemail 91\% of the time (90/99 assigned calls). When patients traveled to the clinic, they spent a median of 45 minutes (IQR 30-60) on travel and 39 minutes (IQR 30-64) waiting prior to appointments. A total of 61\% (37/61) of patients had appointment copays. After participating in the study, patients in the intervention arm reported higher treatment satisfaction than those in the usual care arm.
CONCLUSIONS: MITI is an effective way to help low-SES patients reach their optimal insulin glargine dose using basic SMS text messaging and phone calls. The intervention was feasible and patients were highly satisfied with their treatment. The intervention was cost saving in terms of time for patients, who were able to have their insulin titrated without multiple clinic appointments. Similar interventions should be explored to improve care for low-SES patients managing chronic disease.

DESIGN: Six focus groups were conducted with 25 primary care providers.
SETTING: Two academically affiliated primary care practices serving older adults with CNCP in New York City.
METHODS: The investigators used content analysis to analyze transcribed focus group data and identify specific themes.
RESULTS: While most providers reported limited use of telemedicine, they expressed substantial interest in trying devices such as smartphones in the management of older patients with CNCP. Perceived barriers to implementation of telemedicine tools included information overload, lack of mobile device usability among patients and clinicians, liability issues, and cost. To overcome these barriers, participants suggested implementing electronic or human-based pre-analysis of data (e.g., a computer or a person that triages patient data), creating a low-cost and user-friendly mobile device design, and targeting appropriate user populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary care providers are interested in applying telemedicine when caring for older adults with CNCP. Although they perceived multiple barriers to device implementation, they offered innovative solutions to address these barriers. Providers felt that novel telemedicine technologies may improve the management of CNCP but wanted evidence that the devices were both cost- and time-efficient, and led to improved patient outcomes before adopting their use in practice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing number of patients with diabetes poses a major challenge for the health care system. One instrument to meet these challenges could be the use of telemedicine, which, at the same time, may reduce treatment costs. Since 2005, diabetes patients on the island of Aeroe have been offered expert diabetes care using teleconsultations. This article describes the impact of the telemedicine solution on essential diabetes treatment parameters, patient satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness.
METHODS: Telemedicine consultations were conducted with the patient and nurse specialist placed in a consultation room of Aeroe Hospital in audiovisual contact with the physician situated at the hospital on the mainland. Consultations were supported by an electronic patient record and a Web-based quality-monitoring diabetes database.
RESULTS: Inclusion criteria in this retrospective study were at least 6 months of telemedicine diabetes control with a minimum of two visits and two hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values. Results were compared with data from the Danish National Diabetes Registry (DVDD). Data are given in medians. In total, 23 type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients, aged 65 (56-74) versus 48 years, diabetes duration 21.0 (10.7-31.3) versus 20.5 years, and 55 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, aged 67 (64-70) versus 65 years, diabetes duration 14.0 (10.5-17.5) versus 11.7 years, were included. After teleconsultation, HbA1c in T1DM patients was 8.0\% (7.4-8.6\%) versus 7.9\% [64 (57-71) versus 63 mmol/mol], not significant, and in T2DM patients was 7.4\% (7.1-7.7\%) versus 7.6\% [57 (54-61) versus 60 mmol/mol], p {\textless} .05. Body mass index, blood pressure, and lipid values were comparable with the DVDD. Patient satisfaction was especially related to the major reduction in transportation time (7 h). Reductions in traveling costs and saved working days were the most important factors in making the telemedicine set-up economically efficient.
CONCLUSION: Telemedicine consultation for remote outpatient diabetes control is feasible, and the interdisciplinary interventions achieved high treatment quality results in essential diabetes treatment parameters. In addition, the telemedicine set-up was associated with improved cost-effectiveness and patient satisfaction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of telemedicine and mHealth has increased rapidly in the People's Republic of China. While telemedicine and mHealth have great potential, wide adoption of this technology depends on how patients, health care providers, and other stakeholders in the Chinese health sector perceive and accept the technology.
OBJECTIVE: To explore this issue, we aimed to examine a social media platform with a dedicated focus on health information technology and informatics in China. Our goal is to utilize the findings to support further research.
METHODS: In this exploratory study, we selected a social media platform-HC3i.cn-to examine the perception of telemedicine and mHealth in China. We performed keyword analysis and analyzed the prevalence and term frequency-inverse document frequency of keywords in the selected social media platform; furthermore, we performed qualitative analysis.
RESULTS: We organized the most prominent 16 keywords from 571 threads into 8 themes: (1) Question versus Answer; (2) Hospital versus Clinic; (3) Market versus Company; (4) Doctor versus Nurse; (5) Family versus Patient; (6) iPad versus Tablet; (7) System versus App; and (8) Security versus Caregiving. Social media participants perceived not only significant opportunities associated with telemedicine and mHealth but also barriers to overcome to realize these opportunities.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified interesting issues in this paper by studying a social media platform in China. Among other things, participants in the selected platform raised concerns about quality and costs associated with the provision of telemedicine and mHealth, despite the new technology's great potential to address different issues in the Chinese health sector. The methods applied in this paper have some limitations, and the findings may not be generalizable. We have discussed directions for further research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Rural smokers are more likely to be uninsured and live in poverty, which may pose significant cost barriers to accessing smoking cessation medications. As part of a randomized clinical trial, we provided support to connect low-income smokers with the use of pharmaceutical assistance programs (PAPs) to improve medication access.
METHODS: Study participants were rural smokers enrolled in a randomized clinical trial testing in-office telemedicine versus telephone-based approaches to deliver counseling sessions. For potentially qualified participants, we developed a system to connect them with PAPs that provided smoking cessation medications at low or no cost. Participants reported medication utilization 3 and 6 months after randomization.
RESULTS: Of the 560 study participants, 312 (55.7\%) met initial screening criteria for PAP eligibility. Of those eligible, 104 (33.3\%) initiated a PAP application, with 49 (15.7\%) completing the application and ultimately receiving medications through the programs. Despite the availability of assistance with the PAP application process, overall medication use among those that were eligible for PAP was significantly lower than among participants with higher incomes or access to prescription insurance (60.4\% vs. 51.3\%; P = 0.04). Abstinence among PAP-eligible smokers was also lower at the 3-month follow-up (P = 0.01), but this difference was not present at the 6- and 12-month follow-up surveys.
CONCLUSION: With substantial assistance, some low-income smokers without prescription insurance can get effective smoking cessation medications through PAPs, but overall access remains worse than among those with higher incomes or prescription insurance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To improve patient access to healthcare, the UK government has encouraged technology-based approaches including internet video-consulting. However, little is known about patient acceptance of video-consulting as a consulting method. We aimed to explore primary care patients' views video-consulting.
METHOD: We used semi-structured interviews to survey 270 patients in NHS Lothian. Three diverse General Practices were chosen purposively and sequential patients attending the practice at a range of different times of day were invited to participate. Patients were asked to indicate their level of computer proficiency and provide their views on the use of video-call consulting and what specific applications it might have. We found that 135 of 270 respondents (50\%, 95\% CI 43.9\%-56.1\%) would use video-consulting. Patients under 60 years were over two times more likely to use it (OR 2.2, 95\% CI 2.1-6.6, n = 248) and evidence of a positive trend between increasing computer proficiency and those who would video-consult was found, (χ2 = 43.97, p {\textless} 0.0005, n=270). Patients who had previously used video-calling services (such as Skype™)were approximately six times more likely to favour video-consulting than those who had not (OR 5.9, 95\% CI 3.5-9.9, n = 270).
CONCLUSIONS: This suggests strong patient interest in video-consulting in primary care, however, it is possible that in the short to medium term there may be access inequality favouring younger and more technically able people. Further studies are needed to determine the content, safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of employing this medium.},

We conducted a study to determine if routine clinical assessments of diabetes patients could be effectively conducted via computer and telephone interaction with patients and still provide clinical results similar to traditional office care.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 100 subjects with diabetes in this 12-month, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority study. Subjects were randomized (1:1 ratio) to a control group (CG) or study group (SG). Baseline characteristics were similar. CG subjects participated in quarterly office visits; SG subjects participated in two office visits (months 6 and 12) and two telemedicine interactions (months 3 and 9). Changes in clinical measurements (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], blood pressure, lipids, body mass index [BMI], and body weight) and clinician time requirements were assessed.
RESULTS: Seventy subjects completed the study (CG, n=37; SG, n=33). No significant between-group differences in HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids, or BMI were seen at 12 months. SG subjects showed significantly greater reductions in mean (SD) body weight compared with CG subjects: -5.2 (1.6) pounds versus -0.7 (1.5) pounds, respectively (P=0.04). Clinician time requirements for SG subjects were reduced by {\textgreater}40\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that use of a telemedicine-based treatment protocol in diabetes patients is feasible and efficient and yields similar clinical outcomes compared with traditional, clinic-based protocols. Telemedicine applications of computer software can potentially expand access to care for patients and may reduce costs for patients, providers, and payers.},

This investigation develops an efficient and secure verified-based three-party authentication scheme by using extended chaotic maps for data exchange in telecare medicine information systems. The proposed scheme does not require server's public keys and avoids time-consuming modular exponential computations and scalar multiplications on elliptic curve used in previous related approaches. Additionally, the proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model, and realizes the lower bounds of messages and rounds in communications. Compared to related verified-based approaches, the proposed scheme not only possesses higher security, but also has lower computational cost and fewer transmissions.},

Remote patient monitoring (RPM) for cardiac implantable electronic devices, a novel technology recognized as safe, effective, and cost-effective, and the standard of care in many countries, is prohibited in South Korea. This peculiar situation is apparently due to deficiencies in healthcare policy and the delivery system and also to poor engagement between stakeholders.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: South Korean government is currently in progress of expanding the coverage of telemedicine projects as part of an attempt to vitalize service industry, but is facing fierce opposition from KMA. Practice of telemedicine requires sufficient discussions among related parties. Although the participation of medical specialists is important, agreement from the public is essential.
METHODS: Three main tertiary care centers in Seoul were selected for data collection. A total of 224 patients (patients n = 180, patient guardian n = 44) and medical professionals (n = 41) were selected using simple random sampling. Mixed method of quantitative survey and qualitative semi-interview was used.
RESULTS: This study analyzed patients' and medical professionals' perception about the application of telemedicine in cardiology ward in tertiary care centers to provide baseline data when developing and applying telemedicine services. Results implied high need for encouraging telemedicine projects in order to appeal needs among population by providing experience (p {\textless} 0.001) and knowledge (p {\textless} 0.001). Other results showed that the need for electrocardiography monitoring was high among not only in remote areas but also in areas close to the capital. 64.52\% of all participants thought that telemedicine was needed, and 73.21\% of participants were willing to use telemedicine service if provided. Semi-interviews revealed that participants expected more cost and time saving services through remote treatment, by not having to visit long distance hospitals frequently.
CONCLUSIONS: Research results oppose Korean Medical Association's opinion that the population is against enforcing telemedicine related laws. The findings in this study reflect an up-to-date perception of telemedicine among patients and medical professionals in a tertiary care centers' cardiology ward. Moreover, the study provides a baseline that is needed in order to overcome past failures and to successfully implement telemedicine in South Korea.},

Teledermoscopy, which includes dermoscopic images in the teleconsultation, is another addition that improves remote assessments of pigmented lesions. A more recent variant is mobile teledermoscopy, which uses a smartphone to deliver the same type of service. Teledermoscopy's greatest strength may be as a triage and monitoring tool, as it can reduce the number of unnecessary referrals, wait times, and the cost of providing and receiving dermatological care. While face-to-face (FTF) care remains the gold standard for diagnosis, drawbacks of not using FTF care as the primary method can be mitigated if teleconsultants are willing to refer to FTF care whenever there is uncertainty. Teledermatology has generally been well accepted by patients and practitioners alike. Barriers to the large-scale use of teledermatology remain. Assigning medicolegal responsibility and instituting a reimbursement system are critical to promoting widespread use by medical professionals, while privacy and security features and a mechanism to link teleconsultations to patients' existing health records are essential to maximize patient benefit. Direct-to-consumer services also need attention from regulators to ensure that consumers can enjoy the benefits of telemedicine without the dangers of unregulated or untested platforms.},

It has had many positive effects, including medical access convenience, timeliness of service, and cost reduction. The speed of research and development in remote medical technology has been gradually accelerating. Therefore, it is expected to expand to enable various high-tech information and communications technology (ICT)-based remote medical services. However, the current state lacks an appropriate security framework that can resolve security issues centered on the Internet of things (IoT) environment that will be utilized significantly in telemedicine.
METHODS: This study developed a medical service-oriented frame work for secure remote medical services, possessing flexibility regarding new service and security elements through its service-oriented structure. First, the common architecture of remote medical services is defined. Next medical-oriented secu rity threats and requirements within the IoT environment are identified. Finally, we propose a "service-oriented security frame work for remote medical services" based on previous work and requirements for secure remote medical services in the IoT.
RESULTS: The proposed framework is a secure framework based on service-oriented cases in the medical environment. A com parative analysis focusing on the security elements (confidentiality, integrity, availability, privacy) was conducted, and the analysis results demonstrate the security of the proposed framework for remote medical services with IoT.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework is service-oriented structure. It can support dynamic security elements in accordance with demands related to new remote medical services which will be diversely generated in the IoT environment. We anticipate that it will enable secure services to be provided that can guarantee confidentiality, integrity, and availability for all, including patients, non-patients, and medical staff.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telehealth has been promoted as an adjunct to managing patients with long-term conditions. It has been used in various settings and for different disease groups. However, robust evidence for the efficacy of telehealth is currently lacking.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a telehealth service on emergency admissions and emergency department (ED) attendances.
METHODS: We evaluated a telehealth service providing supported self-management to patients that was implemented in Nottingham City. Two groups of patients ('graduates' of the Nottingham telehealth service and service 'decliners') were compared for two periods; 2009 (pre-service implementation) and 2011. Eighty-nine pairs of graduates and decliners were identified who were matched for age and sex. The number and cost of emergency admissions and ED attendances for these patients were then collated and analysed.
RESULTS: Graduates had significantly fewer emergency admissions and ED attendances compared with decliners in 2011. However, differences of a similar magnitude in emergency admissions and ED attendances were found in 2009. Telehealth service users were likely to be qualitatively different from decliners, reflecting a degree of self-selection. This suggests that decliners were more likely to have a confounding reason for not engaging with telehealth, such as greater disease severity.
CONCLUSIONS: This service review found no evidence that the Nottingham telehealth service has had a significant impact on secondary care utilisation in the short term. Longer term follow up is needed to establish conclusively whether telehealth initiatives like the Nottingham telehealth service does lead to tangible patient benefits and provide value for money.},

The purposes of this case report are: (1) to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a telehealth approach for meeting physical therapist supervision requirements in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) in Washington and (2) to explore clinical and human factors of physical therapist practice in an SNF delivered via telehealth.
CASE DESCRIPTION: In 2009, Infinity Rehab conducted a pilot program to determine whether telehealth could be used to meet physical therapist supervision requirements in an SNF. In 2011, language allowing telehealth physical therapy was approved by the Washington Board of Physical Therapy (Board). In 2014-2015, telehealth outcomes were evaluated in a 51-person sample at an Infinity Rehab SNF. Cost savings of telehealth implementation from 2011 to 2015 were estimated.
OUTCOMES: The Board deemed the telehealth pilot program a success and subsequently established telehealth practice language for physical therapy. Both human factors and clinical outcomes were required to implement a successful telehealth practice. Clinical outcomes and user satisfaction in telehealth and nontelehealth groups were equivalent. Cost savings were identified.
DISCUSSION: Human factors, such as the need for provider education in appropriate bedside manner with a telehealth session, were identified. Since 2011, more than 1,000 telehealth physical therapy sessions were conducted at Infinity Rehab SNFs in Washington State. In the future, alternative payment models focused on valued-based clinical outcomes may facilitate wider telehealth adoption in physical therapy. Future research on efficacy and cost-effectiveness is needed to promote broader adoption of telehealth physical therapy in SNFs. This experience demonstrates that telehealth implementation in an SNF for the purpose of physical therapy re-evaluation is a feasible alternative to in-person encounters.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The Veterans Health Administration is extending its mental health services to reach those in rural areas who find it difficult to travel to a Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). This project aimed to outline implementation of a Pharmacy Mental Health Clinical Video Telehealth (MHCVT) clinic for veterans. Secondary endpoints were to assess patient satisfaction with MHCVT, describe the potential benefits of this clinic regarding travel saved, and summarize no-show rates.
Methods: Veterans received mental health disease state medication management from a mental health clinical pharmacy specialist via clinical video telehealth (CVT) in place of an in-clinic appointment and were asked to complete a satisfaction survey after the initial CVT appointment. Data collected from all veterans enrolled in the CVT clinic from September 8, 2014, through March 23, 2015 included: patient demographics, service connection percentage, number of CVT visits, travel miles saved, travel reimbursement, no-show rate, and documentation of medication management therapy.
Results: As of March 23, 2015, there were 22 veterans enrolled in the MHCVT clinic, of whom, 19 completed their appointments. Of the 48 potential encounters, 7 were considered a no-show (17\%). On average veterans saved 34 travel miles per visit with cumulative savings of 1432.6 miles. Of those who were eligible to receive travel reimbursement (n = 13), the medical center potentially saved \$674.50 in a 7-month period. Overall clinic satisfaction per survey (n = 14) was 100\% (strongly agreed or agreed). A majority (93\%) would recommend the clinic to other veterans.
Conclusions: This project successfully implemented a MHCVT pilot clinic. The veterans were satisfied with the services. The 41 clinic visits resulted in a potential cost savings. Expansion of this clinic in the future will expand more mental health resources to veterans.},

METHODS: The Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-18, Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire, and Health Utilization Questionnaire were used to assess patient satisfaction and healthcare utilization among patients who received care via video connection (telemedicine group) and in clinic (control group). Propensity matching was performed. Scores for questionnaires were reported as mean and standard deviations (SD) and were compared by one-way multivariate analysis of variance and one-way analysis of variance.
RESULTS: There were 21 matched telemedicine patients in our study. Overall mean age (± SD) was 51 (± 5.62) years and 52 (± 6.12) years for telemedicine group and control group, respectively. General patient satisfaction was similar between the two groups (p = 0.89). While telemedicine patients were just as satisfied with communication and interpersonal approach compared to clinic patients, they experienced significantly less commute (p {\textless} 0.0001) and waiting (p {\textless} 0.0001) times. Given ease of using telemedicine without compromising patient-physician interaction, 90\% (19/21) of the telemedicine patients opted to use the service again.
CONCLUSION: Telemedicine appeared to be both a time and cost-saving alternative to clinic follow-up without compromise of the valuable patient-physician relationship. Telemedicine has the potential to improve clinic flow, reduce wait times, and decrease costs for liver transplant recipients.},

A standard cost analysis methodology was used as the initial base, similar to the evaluation method currently being applied to telemedicine, and to which we suggest adding subsequent stages that enhance the scope and sophistication of the analytical methodology. We completed the methodology with a longitudinal and stakeholder analysis, followed by the calculation of a break-even threshold, a calculation of the economic outcome based on net present value (NPV), an estimate of the social gain through external effects, and an assessment of the probability of social benefits. In order to illustrate the advantages, constraints and limitations of the proposed framework, we tested it in a paediatric cardiology tele-expertise network. The results demonstrate that the project threshold was not reached after the 4 years of the study. Also, the calculation of the project's NPV remained negative. However, the additional analytical steps of the proposed framework allowed us to highlight alternatives that can make this service economically viable. These included: use over an extended period of time, extending the network to other telemedicine specialties, or including it in the services offered by other community hospitals. In sum, the results presented here demonstrate the usefulness of an economic evaluation framework as a way of offering decision makers the tools they need to make comprehensive evaluations of telemedicine networks.},

In addition, rural areas with increasingly limited access to specialists are using telemedicine to provide care without transporting patients from small, critical care hospitals into the larger cities.
THE FUTURE: As healthcare reform begins to change the payment structure, episode of care reimbursement will provide the push for hospitals to increase their chronic care management programs. The cost of technology for in-home monitoring is rapidly dropping, and patients will begin to play a greater role in managing their own care. In addition, Washington's pledge to increase the national network infrastructure means that rural areas will have better, faster connections to link specialty services to the cities, and the use of telemedicine for specialty services like telepsychiatry, telestroke and wound care may rise.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Collaborative care is an effective approach for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression within the US Military Health System (MHS), but its cost-effectiveness remains unstudied. Our objective was to evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of centrally assisted collaborative telecare (CACT) versus optimized usual care (OUC) for PTSD and depression in the MHS.
STUDY DESIGN: A randomized trial compared CACT with OUC. Routine primary care screening identified active-duty service members with PTSD or depression. Eligible participants (N = 666) were randomized to CACT or OUC and assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months. OUC patients could receive care management and increased behavioral health support. CACT patients could receive these services plus stepped psychosocial treatment and routine centralized team monitoring.
METHODS: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were derived from the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. Claims and case management data were used to estimate costs. Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted from a societal perspective.
RESULTS: Data from 629 patients (320 CACT and 309 OUC) with sufficient follow-up were analyzed. CACT patients gained 0.02 QALYs (95\% CI, -0.001 to 0.03) relative to OUC patients. Twelve-month costs, including productivity, were \$987 (95\% CI, -\$3056 to \$5030) higher for CACT versus OUC. CACT was estimated to cost \$49,346 per QALY gained compared with OUC over 12 months. There is a 58\% probability that CACT is cost-effective at a \$100,000/QALY threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its higher costs, CACT appears to be a cost-effective strategy relative to OUC for managing PTSD and depression in the MHS.},

For this article, radiation safety is considered as one of the key quality elements. The stakeholders are the drivers of quality imaging. These include those that directly provide or use imaging procedures and others indirectly supporting the system. Imaging is indispensable in health care, and its use has greatly expanded worldwide. Globalization, consumer sophistication, communication and technological advances, corporatization, rationalization, service outsourcing, teleradiology, workflow modularization, and commoditization are reshaping practice. This article defines the emerging issues; an earlier article in the May 2011 issue described possible improvement actions. The issues that could threaten the quality use of imaging for all countries include workforce shortage; increased utilization, population radiation exposure, and cost; practice changes; and efficiency drive and budget constraints. In response to these issues, a range of quality improvement measures, strategies, and actions are used to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks. The 3 measures are procedure justification, optimization of image quality and radiation protection, and error prevention. The development and successful implementation of such improvement actions require leadership, collaboration, and the active participation of all stakeholders to achieve the best outcomes that we all advocate.},

	abstract = {Remote monitoring of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) has emerged as a tool to replace regular follow-up of such devices, and to detect hardware failure, arrhythmias, and heart failure decompensation. The Asia-Pacific region is a geographically diverse area, with widely different cardiac device implant rates and expertise. However, common to all countries, distance and logistic for patients to reach an expert monitoring centre for routine follow up are significant, and in some countries, this will likely be replaced by remote monitoring. Unscheduled visits such as for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and ICD shocks will be expedited. There has been an increase in both pacemaker and ICD implant rates in Asia-Pacific, due to an ageing population and improvement in economic condition. Among the countries, Australia and Japan are the major users of remote monitoring. According to the statistics of the suppliers, in Australia, up to 15\% of pacemakers, 40\% ICD, and 30\% cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)/cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CTRD) are remotely monitored. The corresponding numbers for Japan are 5, 50, and 50\% respectively. The monitoring personnel include nurses, technicians, and doctors, either from local centre or from device companies. Cost, lack of reimbursement, and logistic support are major issues in widespread application of remote monitoring technology. In conclusion, remote monitoring is increasing in Asia-Pacific region despite the increase in cost. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators and CRT/CRTDs are more likely than pacemakers to be enabled with remote monitoring.},

RESULTS: A total of 59 trauma and general surgery patients were evaluated. Of those, 35 (59\%) were trauma patients, and 24 (41\%) were general surgery patients. Fifty patients (85\%) were from the first hospital at which teletrauma was established. For 6 patients, the teletrauma consults were considered potentially lifesaving; 17 patients (29\%) were kept in the rural hospitals (8 trauma and 9 general surgery patients). Treating patients in the rural hospitals avoided transfers, saving an average of \$19,698 per air transport or \$2,055 per ground transport.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Ministry of Health of Kosova has recently announced the Telemedicine Program of Kosova (TMPK) as the official institution responsible for managing and coordinating the nation's Long-Distance Continuous Medical Education (CME) program. There are a lack of studies on cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and other economic evaluations of telemedicine programs (TMP), in particular the financial value of CME offered through such a service. In addition, there is lack of prospective studies on Monitoring \& Evaluation (M\&E) of TMP.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to conduct a retrospective CBA of prospective data collected at TMPK over a 5-year period (2005-2010) in order to determine the cost benefit as opposed to the alternative method of delivery of this model for developing countries whose healthcare systems are in disarray.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed data on the number of participants in virtual lectures both at the Telemedicine Center of Kosova (TCK) as well as the number of participants at six Regional Telemedicine Centers throughout Kosova, the number of lectures broadcasted, the clinical cases reviewed and transmitted for international consultation, and other quantitative data.
RESULTS: Only in 2009, approximately 2,000 CME certificates were awarded to physicians and nurses of Kosova, 18 international teleconsultations were conducted, 138 videoconferences, lectures, and seminars were held, and there were over 9,000 visitors at the TCK e-library. Data analysis shows that the TMPK has been an efficient mechanism for CME and sustainable model for rebuilding the medical system. TMPK has been successful in offering physicians, nurses, and other medical professions access to electronic information.
CONCLUSIONS: TMP is an efficient mechanism to ensure CME and rebuilding medical systems in developing countries. There is a need for prospective CBA of any TMP and the establishment of M\&E programs in any future telemedicine initiatives in developing countries.},

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a Web-based physical activity intervention for Latina adolescents in a single-arm pilot trial.
METHODS: A total of 21 Latina adolescents (aged 12-18 years) who could read and write in English and were underactive ({\textless}90 min/week) participated in a 12-week, theory-informed Web-based physical activity intervention. The intervention website was modified from a previous Web-based intervention for Latina adults. Web content was individually tailored based on the responses to monthly questionnaires. Feasibility was measured by recruitment, retention, and adherence/engagement, and acceptability was measured by satisfaction surveys. Physical activity was measured at baseline and follow-up (12 weeks) using the 7-day physical activity recall (PAR) interview and accelerometers.
RESULTS: Baseline activity as measured by the 7-day PAR and accelerometers was 24.7 (SD 26.11) and 24.8 (SD 38.3) min/week, respectively. At 12 weeks, 19 participants (90\%, 19/21) returned. Adherence and engagement with materials were low, but 72\% (15/21) of the participants indicated that they were satisfied with the intervention. Activity at 12 weeks increased by 58.8 (SD 11.33) min/week measured by the 7-day PAR (P{\textless}.001). Accelerometer-measured activity did not increase. Activities reported at follow-up were more varied than at baseline, including some activities measured poorly by accelerometers (eg, biking and swimming). Participants suggested simplifying the website and incorporating other technologies.
CONCLUSIONS: Good retention and increases in self-reported activity suggest a promising approach to delivering a physical activity intervention to Latina adolescents. Incorporating other technologies, such as smartphone apps, could make the intervention more engaging, acceptable, and effective.},

METHODS: GIS is used to evaluate the feasibility of m-Health technologies as part of anti-malaria strategies. This study investigates where in Uganda: (1) malaria affects the largest number of people; (2) the application of m-Health protocol based on the mobile network has the highest potential impact.
RESULTS: About 75\% of the population affected by Plasmodium falciparum malaria have scarce access to healthcare facilities. The introduction of m-Health technologies should be based on the 2G protocol, as 3G mobile network coverage is still limited. The western border and the central-Southeast are the regions where m-Health could reach the largest percentage of the remote population. Six districts (Arua, Apac, Lira, Kamuli, Iganga, and Mubende) could have the largest benefit because they account for about 28\% of the remote population affected by falciparum malaria with access to the 2G mobile network.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of m-Health technologies could improve access to medical services for distant populations. Affordable remote malaria diagnosis could help to decongest health facilities, reducing costs and contagion. The combination of m-Health and GIS could provide real-time and geo-localized data transmission, improving anti-malarial strategies in Uganda.

Telemedicine services show benefits while monitoring patients in post-evacuation, helping to address the lack of responsive care in some specialties whose actual use will help save resources both in provision and in management of the evacuation procedures. Additionally, with tele-cardiology collaborative service many evacuations can be avoided whereas many cases will be treated and followed locally in Cape Verde with remote technical support from Portugal. This international telemedicine service enabled more efficient evacuations, by reducing expenses in travel and housing, and therefore contributed to the health system's improvement.

However, few studies have evaluated the economic impact compared to conventional care, and no cost analysis of a remote monitoring prenatal follow-up program for women diagnosed with gestational hypertensive diseases (GHD) has been published.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the costs of remote monitoring versus conventional care relative to reported benefits.
METHODS: Patient data from the Pregnancy Remote Monitoring (PREMOM) study were used. Health care costs were calculated from patient-specific hospital bills of Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg (Genk, Belgium) in 2015. Cost comparison was made from three perspectives: the Belgian national health care system (HCS), the National Institution for Insurance of Disease and Disability (RIZIV), and costs for individual patients. The calculations were made for four major domains: prenatal follow-up, prenatal admission to the hospital, maternal and neonatal care at and after delivery, and total amount of costs. A simulation exercise was made in which it was calculated how much could be demanded of RIZIV for funding the remote monitoring service.
RESULTS: A total of 140 pregnancies were included, of which 43 received remote monitoring (30.7\%) and 97 received conventional care (69.2\%). From the three perspectives, there were no differences in costs for prenatal follow-up. Compared to conventional care, remote monitoring patients had 34.51\% less HCS and 41.72\% less RIZIV costs for laboratory test results (HCS: mean €0.00 [SD €55.34] vs mean €38.28 [SD € 44.08], P{\textless}.001; RIZIV: mean €21.09 [SD €27.94] vs mean €36.19 [SD €41.36], P{\textless}.001) and a reduction of 47.16\% in HCS and 48.19\% in RIZIV costs for neonatal care (HCS: mean €989.66 [SD €3020.22] vs mean €1872.92 [SD €5058.31], P{\textless}.001; RIZIV: mean €872.97 [SD €2761.64] vs mean €1684.86 [SD €4702.20], P{\textless}.001). HCS costs for medication were 1.92\% lower in remote monitoring than conventional care (mean €209.22 [SD €213.32] vs mean €231.32 [SD 67.09], P=.02), but were 0.69\% higher for RIZIV (mean €122.60 [SD €92.02] vs mean €121.78 [SD €20.77], P{\textless}.001). Overall HCS costs for remote monitoring were mean €4233.31 (SD €3463.31) per person and mean €4973.69 (SD €5219.00) per person for conventional care (P=.82), a reduction of €740.38 (14.89\%) per person, with savings mainly for RIZIV of €848.97 per person (23.18\%; mean €2797.42 [SD €2905.18] vs mean €3646.39 [SD €4878.47], P=.19). When an additional fee of €525.07 per month per pregnant woman for funding remote monitoring costs is demanded, remote monitoring is acceptable in their costs for HCS, RIZIV, and individual patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In the current organization of Belgian health care, a remote monitoring prenatal follow-up of women with GHD is cost saving for the global health care system, mainly via savings for the insurance institution RIZIV.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2015, we performed a cost analysis of a prenatal remote monitoring (RM) program compared with conventional care (CC) for women diagnosed with gestational hypertensive disorders (GHD).
INTRODUCTION: We investigated where the cost savings were distributed by dividing our patient population into three subgroups, according to the gestational age (GA) at the time of delivery: (1) {\textless}34 weeks; (2) 34-37 weeks; and (3) {\textgreater}37 weeks of GA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Health care costs were calculated from patient-specific hospital bills at Ziekenhuis Oost Limburg (Genk, Belgium) in 2015-2016. Cost comparisons were made from the perspectives of the Belgium national health care system (HCS), the National Institution for Insurance of Disease and Disability (RIZIV), and the costs to individual patients.
RESULTS: A total of 256 pregnant women were included, 80 (31.25\%) of whom received RM and 176 (68.75\%) of whom received CC. The greatest difference in costs between RM and CC was in the group that delivered before 34 weeks of GA, followed by the group who delivered after 37 weeks of GA, and then the group of women who delivered at 34-37 weeks of GA. Most of the cost savings were in neonatal care, for both the three separate study subgroups and the total study group.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our data showed that RM is more cost-effective than CC for pregnant women with GHD. Further investigation of the effects of RM on the long-term economic and social costs is recommended, together with an analysis of the price that should be asked for RM services.},

	abstract = {Objective There has been very little use of telehealth in pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS), yet the potential exists for this technology to transform the current delivery model. In this study, we explore the costs and benefits of one large telehealth EMS initiative. Methods Using a case-control study design and both micro- and gross-costing data from the Houston Fire Department EMS electronic patient care record system, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) comparing costs with potential savings associated with patients treated through a telehealth-enabled intervention. The intervention consisted of telehealth-based consultation between the 911 patient and an EMS physician, to evaluate and triage the necessity for patient transport to a hospital emergency department (ED). Patients with non-urgent, primary care-related conditions were then scheduled and transported by alternative means to an affiliated primary care clinic. We measured CBA as both total cost savings and cost per ED visit averted, in US Dollars (\$USD). Results In total, 5570 patients were treated over the first full 12 months with a telehealth-enabled care model. We found a 6.7\% absolute reduction in potentially medically unnecessary ED visits, and a 44-minute reduction in total ambulance back-in-service times. The average cost for a telehealth patient was \$167, which was a statistically significantly \$103 less than the control group ( p {\textless} .0001). The programme produced a \$928,000 annual cost savings from the societal perspective, or \$2468 cost savings per ED visit averted (benefit). Conclusion Patient care enabled by telehealth in a pre-hospital environment, is a more cost effective alternative compared to the traditional EMS 'treat and transport to ED' model.},

However, their full potentials have not been reached, as most of current technologies are restricted to monitoring physical and behavioral parameters, such as body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and physical movement, while direct monitoring of biomarkers in body fluids can provide much more accurate and useful information for medical diagnostics. A major barrier to realizing the full potential of mHealth is the high costs and long cycles of developing mHealth devices capable of monitoring biomarkers in body fluids. To lower the costs and shorten the developmental cycle, we have demonstrated the leveraging of the most successful portable medical monitoring device on the market, the blood glucose meter (BGM), with FDA-approved smartphone technologies that allow for wireless transmission and remote monitoring of a wide range of non-glucose targets. In this protocol, an aptamer-based assay for quantification of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) using an off-the-shelf BGM is described. In this assay, an aptamer-based target recognition system is employed. When IFN-γ binds to the aptamer, it triggers the release of a reporter enzyme, invertase, which can catalyze the conversion of sucrose (not detected by BGM) to glucose. The glucose being produced is then detected using a BGM. The system mimics a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), where the traditional immunoassay is replaced by an aptamer binding assay; the reporter protein is replaced by invertase, and finally the optical or fluorescence detector is replaced with widely available BGMs.},

Using the same method of analysis for 2009 data showed that cost savings would occur if the annual workload was 20 patients in ophthalmology and 17 patients in dermatology. The main differences between the two studies are the reduced cost of the technology (which was based on PCs in 2009) and the increased cost of staff. Both studies show that teleconsultations can be cost-effective in a relatively small health centre. The cost of technology continues to decrease, although the other costs in our break-even analysis continue to increase.

Teleconferencing is also a very useful tool as a distance learning method.Teleconferencing is a real-time and live interactive programme in which one set of participants are at one or more locations and the other set of participants are at another. The teleconference allows for interaction, including audio and/or video, and possibly other modalities, between at least two sites. Various methods are available for setting up a teleconferencing unit. A detailed review of the trend in the use of teleconferencing in medical education was conducted using Medline and a literature search.Teleconferencing was found to be a very useful tool in continuing medical education (CME), postgraduate medical education, undergraduate medical education, telementoring and many other situations. The use of teleconferencing in medical education has many advantages including savings in terms of travel costs and time. It gives access to the best educational resources and experience without any limitations of boundaries of distance and time. It encourages two-way interactions and facilitates learning in adults. Despite having some pitfalls in its implementation it is now being seen as an important tool in facilitating learning in medicine and many medical schools and institutions are adapting this novel tool.},

Remote delivery of psychotherapy has been established as a viable alternative to traditional in-person psychotherapy for treating anxiety and depression. However, literature comparing and evaluating the variety of remote delivery modalities of psychotherapy has not yet been integrated. This review examines the efficacy, practicality, and limitations of telephone, video, and online-administered psychotherapy for the treatment of anxiety and depression.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search conducted using PubMed and PsycINFO included systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and cost-analysis studies focused on a remote delivery method of psychotherapy for anxiety and depression.
RESULTS: Overall, interventions delivered through telephone, video, and online modalities demonstrated good efficacy in treating anxiety and depression in general, and when presenting comorbid with other disorders. The literature also suggested that telehealth psychotherapy is accessible, convenient, and cost-effective. However, there is less evidence for video-delivered psychotherapy for anxiety and depression compared with telephone-administered and online-administered modalities. Despite this, overall, the efficacy and practical benefits of remote psychotherapy interventions in treating anxiety and depression across a diverse range of patient groups suggested that it is an appropriate alternative for those who cannot access in-person psychotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Further research evaluating the efficacy and practical benefits of video-delivered psychotherapy for anxiety and depression is much needed for patients with limited access to in-person psychological care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telephone triage and advice services (TTAS) are increasingly being implemented around the world. These services allow people to speak to a nurse or general practitioner over the telephone and receive assessment and healthcare advice. There is an existing body of research on the topic of TTAS, however the diffuseness of the evidence base makes it difficult to identify key lessons that are consistent across the literature. Systematic reviews represent the highest level of evidence synthesis. We aimed to undertake an overview of such reviews to determine the scope, consistency and generalisability of findings in relation to the governance, safety and quality of TTAS.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library for English language systematic reviews focused on key governance, quality and safety findings related to telephone based triage and advice services, published since 1990. The search was undertaken by three researchers who reached consensus on all included systematic reviews. An appraisal of the methodological quality of the systematic reviews was independently undertaken by two researchers using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews.
RESULTS: Ten systematic reviews from a potential 291 results were selected for inclusion. TTAS was examined either alone, or as part of a primary care service model or intervention designed to improve primary care. Evidence of TTAS performance was reported across nine key indicators - access, appropriateness, compliance, patient satisfaction, cost, safety, health service utilisation, physician workload and clinical outcomes. Patient satisfaction with TTAS was generally high and there is some consistency of evidence of the ability of TTAS to reduce clinical workload. Measures of the safety of TTAS tended to show that there is no major difference between TTAS and traditional care.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken as a whole, current evidence does not provide definitive answers to questions about the quality of care provided, access and equity of the service, its costs and outcomes. The available evidence also suggests that there are many interactional factors (e.g., relationship with other health service providers) which can impact on measures of performance, and also affect the external validity of the research findings.},

Traditionally, these estimates have relied on comprehensive mapping. However, this approach is prohibitively resource-intensive over large areas, making it both impractical and statistically unreliable. Probabilistic (design-based) approaches to evaluating status and trends provide a more cost-effective alternative because, compared with comprehensive mapping, overall extent is inferred from mapping a statistically representative, randomly selected subset of the target area. In this type of design, the size of sample plots has a significant impact on program costs and on statistical precision and accuracy; however, no consensus exists on the appropriate plot size for remote monitoring of stream and wetland extent. This study utilized simulated sampling to assess the performance of four plot sizes (1, 4, 9, and 16 km(2)) for three geographic regions of California. Simulation results showed smaller plot sizes (1 and 4 km(2)) were most efficient for achieving desired levels of statistical accuracy and precision. However, larger plot sizes were more likely to contain rare and spatially limited wetland subtypes. Balancing these considerations led to selection of 4 km(2) for the California status and trends program.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: On-site hospitalist care can improve patient care, but it is economically infeasible for small critical access hospitals (CAHs). A telemedicine "virtual hospitalist" may expand CAH capabilities at a fractional cost of an on"site provider.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a virtual hospitalist on transfers from a CAH to outside hospitals.
DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS: A 6-month pilot program providing "virtual hospitalist" coverage to patients at a CAH in rural Iowa.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the rate of outside transfers from the CAH Emergency Department (ED). The secondary outcomes included transfer from either the ED or the inpatient wards, daily census, length of stay, transfers after admission, virtual hospitalist time commitment, and patient and staff satisfaction. The preceding 24-week baseline was compared with 24 weeks after implementation, excluding a 2-week transition period.
RESULTS: At baseline, there were 947 ED visits and 176 combined inpatient and observation encounters, compared to 930 and 176 after implementation, respectively. Outside transfers from the ED decreased from 16.6\% to 10.5\% (157/947 to 98/930, P {\textless} .001), and transfers at any time decreased from 17.3\% to 11.9\% (164/947 to 111/930, P {\textless} .001). Daily census, length of stay, and transfers after admission were unchanged. Time commitment for a virtual hospitalist was 35 minutes per patient per day. The intervention was well received by the CAH staff and patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The virtual hospitalist model increased the percentage of ED patients who could safely receive their care locally. A single virtual hospitalist may be able to cover multiple CAHs simultaneously.
FUNDING: Development of this project was funded through the University of Iowa Hospitalist group and the Signal Center for Health Innovations at UI Health Ventures. Virtual hospitalist clinical time was paid for by the CAH on a fractional basis of a traditional hospitalist based on projected patient volumes through analysis of baseline data. Patients were not directly billed for virtual hospitalist service but were charged for the services provided by CAH providers.},

In this work, we reviewed their protocol and found that it is not secure against stolen verifier attack, many logged in patient attack, patient anonymity, impersonation attack, and fails to protect session key. For enhancement of security level, we proposed a new mutual authentication protocol for the similar environment. The presented framework is also more capable in terms of computation cost. In addition, the security evaluation of the protocol protects resilience of all possible security attributes, and we also explored formal security evaluation based on random oracle model. The performance of the proposed protocol is much better in comparison to the existing protocol.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: U.S. healthcare costs consistently outpace inflation, causing growing problems of affordability. This trend cannot be sustained indefinitely.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to use supply-chain tools for macro-level examination of the U.S. healthcare as a business system and identify options and best use practices.
METHOD: We compare the important and successful U.S. food industry to the essential but problematic U.S. healthcare industry. Supply chain strategies leading to food business operations success are examined and healthcare applications suggested. We emphasize "total cost of ownership" which includes all costs incurred by all stakeholders of U.S. healthcare, including maintenance and cleanup, not just the initial purchase price.
RESULTS: U.S. hospitals and clinics can use supply chain strategies in a total cost of ownership framework to reduce healthcare costs while maintaining patient care quality. Supply chain strategies of resource pooling, mass customization, centralized logistics, specialization, postponement and continuous improvement that have been successfully used in the U.S. food industry should be more widely applied to the U.S. healthcare industry. New and growing areas of telemedicine and medical tourism should be included in the supply chain analysis of U.S. healthcare. Valid statistical analysis of results in all areas of U.S. healthcare is an important part of the process.
CONCLUSIONS: U.S. healthcare industry problems are systematic operational and supply chain problems rather than problems with workforce or technology. Examination of the U.S. healthcare industry through a supply chain framework should lead to significant operational improvement in both prevention and treatment of acute and chronic ailments. A rational and unemotional reorganization of the U.S. healthcare system operations, using supply chain strategies, should help reduce healthcare costs while maintaining quality and increasing accessibility.},

While there is great potential for such ubiquitous technology to revolutionise access and quality of healthcare in low-resource settings, there have been few successes at scale. Implementations of electronic health (e-Health) and mobile health (m-Health) technologies in countries like Kenya are yet to tackle human resource constraints or the political, ethical and financial considerations of such technologies. We outline recent innovations that could improve access and quality while considering the costs of healthcare. One is an attempt to create a scalable clinical decision support system by engaging a global network of specialist doctors and reversing some of the damaging effects of medical brain drain. The other efficiently extracts digital information from paper-based records using low-cost and locally produced tools such as rubber stamps to improve adherence to clinical practice guidelines. By bringing down the costs of remote consultations and clinical audit, respectively, these projects offer the potential for clinics in resource-limited settings to deliver high-quality care. This paper makes a case for continued and increased investment in social enterprises that bridge academia, public and private sectors to deliver sustainable and scalable e-Health and m-Health solutions.},

Here, we compared a novel telerehabilitation system for virtual reality-supported balance training with balance training with only a standing frame and with conventional therapy in the hospital. The proposed low-cost experimental system for balance training enabling multiple home systems, real-time tracking of task's performance and different views of captured data with balance training, consists of a standing frame equipped with a tilt sensor, a low-cost computer, display, and internet connection. Goal-based tasks for balance training in the virtual environment proved motivating for the participating individuals. The physiotherapist, located in the remote healthcare center, could remotely adjust the level of complexity and difficulty or preview the outcomes and instructions with the application on the mobile smartphone. Patients using the virtual reality-supported balance training showed an improvement in the task performance time of 45\% and number of collisions of 68\%, showing significant improvements in the Berg Balance Scale, Timed 'Up and Go', and 10 m Walk Test. The clinical outcomes were not significantly different from balance training with only the standing frame or conventional therapy. The proposed telerehabilitation can facilitate the physiotherapists' work and thus enable rehabilitation to a larger number of patients after release from the hospital because it requires less time and infrequent presence of the clinical staff. However, a comprehensive clinical evaluation is required to confirm the applicability of the concept.},

Although collaborative care interventions are well-established for conditions such as depression, fewer systems-based interventions have been tested for chronic pain. This paper describes the study design and baseline characteristics of the enrolled sample for the Stepped Care to Optimize Pain care Effectiveness (SCOPE) study, a randomized clinical effectiveness trial conducted in five primary care clinics. SCOPE has enrolled 250 primary care veterans with persistent (3 months or longer) musculoskeletal pain of moderate severity and randomized them to either the stepped care intervention or usual care control group. Using a telemedicine collaborative care approach, the intervention couples automated symptom monitoring with a telephone-based, nurse care manager/physician pain specialist team to treat pain. The goal is to optimize analgesic management using a stepped care approach to drug selection, symptom monitoring, dose adjustment, and switching or adding medications. All subjects undergo comprehensive outcome assessments at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months by interviewers blinded to treatment group. The primary outcome is pain severity/disability, and secondary outcomes include pain beliefs and behaviors, psychological functioning, health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction. Innovations of SCOPE include optimized analgesic management (including a stepped care approach, opioid risk stratification, and criteria-based medication adjustment), automated monitoring, and centralized care management that can cover multiple primary care practices.},

More patients receive treatment for mental disorders in the primary care sector than in the mental health specialty setting. However, brief visits, inadequate reimbursement, deficits in primary care provider (PCP) training, and competing demands often limit the capacity of the PCP to produce optimal outcomes in patients with common mental disorders. More than 80 randomized trials have shown the benefits of collaborative care (CC) models for improving outcomes of patients with depression and anxiety. Six key components of CC include a population-based approach, measurement-based care, treatment to target strategy, care management, supervision by a mental health professional (MHP), and brief psychological therapies. Multiple trials have also shown that CC for depression is equally or more cost-effective than many of the current treatments for medical disorders. Factors that may facilitate the implementation of CC include a more favorable alignment of medical and mental health services in accountable care organizations and patient-centered medical homes; greater use of telecare as well as automated outcome monitoring; identification of patients who might benefit most from CC; and systematic training of both PCPs and MHPs in integrated team-based care.},

The system used a 19,200 baud modem connection via the ordinary telephone network. The diagnoses on presentation were intracerebral haematoma (50\%), trauma (27\%), subarachnoid haemorrhage (4\%), stroke (5\%) and others (14\%). Retrospective analysis showed that in 67\% of cases admission and therefore ground-based transportation of the patients to our neurosurgical centre was not necessary for different reasons (moribund status, no surgical intervention required or no neurosurgical problem at all). If each patient had been transferred, then the potential savings for ground transportation were euro339.93 per case (with accompanying physician of the affiliated hospital) or euro373.96 per case (with accompanying experienced ICU physician), respectively (euro1 is US\$1.4). The total cost of the image transfer system for all eight hospitals was euro96,000; this was amortised after 282 teleconsultations, which occurred after 15 months of usage. A simple teleradiology system in neurosurgery enables rapid and reliable telephone consultations, mainly on patients with trauma, stroke and intracerebral haematoma at low cost.},

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine health app use among mobile phone owners in the United States.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1604 mobile phone users throughout the United States. The 36-item survey assessed sociodemographic characteristics, history of and reasons for health app use/nonuse, perceived effectiveness of health apps, reasons for stopping use, and general health status.
RESULTS: A little over half (934/1604, 58.23\%) of mobile phone users had downloaded a health-related mobile app. Fitness and nutrition were the most common categories of health apps used, with most respondents using them at least daily. Common reasons for not having downloaded apps were lack of interest, cost, and concern about apps collecting their data. Individuals more likely to use health apps tended to be younger, have higher incomes, be more educated, be Latino/Hispanic, and have a body mass index (BMI) in the obese range (all P{\textless}.05). Cost was a significant concern among respondents, with a large proportion indicating that they would not pay anything for a health app. Interestingly, among those who had downloaded health apps, trust in their accuracy and data safety was quite high, and most felt that the apps had improved their health. About half of the respondents (427/934, 45.7\%) had stopped using some health apps, primarily due to high data entry burden, loss of interest, and hidden costs.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that while many individuals use health apps, a substantial proportion of the population does not, and that even among those who use health apps, many stop using them. These data suggest that app developers need to better address consumer concerns, such as cost and high data entry burden, and that clinical trials are necessary to test the efficacy of health apps to broaden their appeal and adoption.},

However, the extent to which it is delivering on its promises is unclear as the scientific evidence needed to justify success is still emerging. Many have identified the need to advance the scientific knowledge base to better quantify success. One method for advancing that knowledge base is a standard telemental health evaluation model. Telemental health is defined here as the provision of mental health services using live, interactive video-teleconferencing technology. Evaluation in the telemental health field largely consists of descriptive and small pilot studies, is often defined by the individual goals of the specific programs, and is typically focused on only one outcome. The field should adopt new evaluation methods that consider the co-adaptive interaction between users (patients and providers), healthcare costs and savings, and the rapid evolution in communication technologies. Acceptance of a standard evaluation model will improve perceptions of telemental health as an established field, promote development of a sounder empirical base, promote interagency collaboration, and provide a framework for more multidisciplinary research that integrates measuring the impact of the technology and the overall healthcare aspect. We suggest that consideration of a standard model is timely given where telemental health is at in terms of its stage of scientific progress. We will broadly recommend some elements of what such a standard evaluation model might include for telemental health and suggest a way forward for adopting such a model.},

Early and sustained administration of oral nutritional supplements has been shown to improve the nutritional status with robust clinical benefit. Many patients however, poorly adhere to prescribed supplements, so consistent monitoring is needed. Clinical monitoring usually ends with the discharge rendering the continuation of nutritional supplement therapy in the patient's home problematic. We developed a telemedicine based health care concept for intensive home monitoring. In a first randomized controlled prospective study we analyzed the feasibility of this innovative approach. The intervention group received oral nutritional supplements and telemedical monitoring with daily assessment of body weight, number of taken oral energy supplements and state of health. The control group received usual care. 13 patients were included in each group, eight patients of the intervention group left the study prematurely, five patients were closely monitored and used the devices for a mean 67 ± 63.5 days. Follow up data of body weight and BMI showed no relevant differences between both groups. The results and experiences gained in this pilot study demonstrate that telemedical systems provide encouraging new options to enable an intensive monitoring of malnourished patients. A continuous intensive therapy monitoring of this patient group however, is a particular challenge. Albeit possibilities, limitations and useful parameters were identified, which will be used to improve the conception in an ongoing prospective randomized trial.},

The mean round-trip travel time from home to clinic was 6.8 hours (SD ± 8.6 hours). All participants thought telemedicine was more cost-effective than a clinic visit. Parents estimated that participating in a telemedicine visit instead of a clinic appointment saved them on average \$486.
CONCLUSION: This prospective, pediatric headache telemedicine study shows that telemedicine is convenient, perceived to be cost-effective, and patient-centered. Providing the option of telemedicine for routine pediatric headache follow-up visits results in high patient and family satisfaction.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Access to health care in rural areas of developing nations is hindered by both the lack of physicians and the preference of many physicians to practice in urban settings. As a result, rural patients often choose not to sacrifice wages or time to visit distant health care providers. A telemedicine system, Mashavu: Networked Health Solutions, designed to increase access to preprimary health care in rural areas, was field-tested in rural Kenya. This study aims to examine the reliability of the system compared to the traditional face-to-face method of health care delivery.
METHOD: Reliability of the telemedicine system was tested using a modified intraobserver concordance study. Community health workers operated the system in various remote locations. Patient health information including chief complaint, medical history, and vital statistics were sent via Internet to a consulting nurse. After patients completed the telemedicine consultation, they also met in-person with the same nurse. Subsequently, the nurse's advice during the in-person session was compared with his feedback provided through the telemedicine consultation.
RESULTS: When comparing the nurse's advice given through the telemedicine system with the advice given through more traditional face-to-face, in-person consultation, the nurse provided consistent medical feedback in 78.4\% of the cases (n = 102). The nurse's advice regarding patient action (eg, clinical referrals or no further care necessary) was the same in 89.2\% of the cases (n = 91).
CONCLUSION: The study found that this telemedicine system was able to provide patients with approximately the same quality of care and advice as if the patient had physically travelled to a clinic to see a nurse. In rural areas of developing nations where there are high logistical and economical barriers to accessing health care, this telemedicine system successfully increased the ease and lowered the cost of connecting rural patients with nurses to provide preprimary care.},

However, most of these systems ask clients to install special software tools or web plug-ins to support whiteboard discussion, special medical image format, and customized decoding algorithm of data transmission of HRIs (high-resolution images). This limits the accessibility of the software running on different devices and operating systems. In this paper, we propose a solution based on pure web pages for medical HRIs lossless sharing and e-whiteboard discussion, and have set up a medical HRI sharing and e-whiteboard system, which has four-layered design: (1) HRIs access layer: we improved an tile-pyramid model named unbalanced ratio pyramid structure (URPS), to rapidly share lossless HRIs and to adapt to the reading habits of users; (2) format conversion layer: we designed a format conversion engine (FCE) on server side to real time convert and cache DICOM tiles which clients requesting with window-level parameters, to make browsers compatible and keep response efficiency to server-client; (3) business logic layer: we built a XML behavior relationship storage structure to store and share users' behavior, to keep real time co-browsing and discussion between clients; (4) web-user-interface layer: AJAX technology and Raphael toolkit were used to combine HTML and JavaScript to build client RIA (rich Internet application), to meet clients' desktop-like interaction on any pure webpage. This system can be used to quickly browse lossless HRIs, and support discussing and co-browsing smoothly on any web browser in a diversified network environment. The proposal methods can provide a way to share HRIs safely, and may be used in the field of regional health, telemedicine and remote education at a low cost.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: To overcome travel distance and lack of local expertise, telemedicine programs have been implemented and are still pilot programs in many jurisdictions. Patient perspectives remain poorly understood. In the largest study to date, we examined user satisfaction and predictors of patient choice to use telemedicine among Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients in the context of a well-developed telemedicine system. These data can help to optimize healthcare delivery by telemedicine.
METHODS: A patient satisfaction questionnaire was administered to current or previous users via telephone. Patients' cost savings were determined. The proportion of non-users interested in using telemedicine was quantified. Demographic and clinical characteristics of those who expressed interest in the program vs. those who did not were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 34 users and 103 non-users were recruited. Users reported an average cost reduction of \$200 and 209 minutes of reduction in commute time (p {\textless} 0.01). While a majority (29/34 users) reported interest in continuing with telemedicine, inexperience of some telehealth nurses was a major source of patient dissatisfaction. Patients preferred a combination of telehealth and in-person visits. A majority of non-users (55/103, 53\%) declared interest in telemedicine, but it had not been offered to them. A lower Hoehn and Yahr stage and a longer commute time were associated with patient interest in telemedicine.
CONCLUSIONS: Training of nurses is an important determinant of patient satisfaction. Clinicians should consider offering telehealth to all patients for whom it is medically appropriate, especially those who experience long travel times.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Collaborative care interventions for depression in primary care settings are clinically beneficial and cost-effective. Most prior studies were conducted in urban settings.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of a rural telemedicine-based collaborative care depression intervention.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of intervention vs usual care.
SETTING: Seven small (serving 1000 to 5000 veterans) Veterans Health Administration community-based outpatient clinics serving rural catchment areas in 3 mid-South states. Each site had interactive televideo dedicated to mental health but no psychiatrist or psychologist on site. Patients Among 18 306 primary care patients who were screened, 1260 (6.9\%) screened positive for depression; 395 met eligibility criteria and were enrolled from April 2003 to September 2004. Of those enrolled, 360 (91.1\%) completed a 6-month follow-up and 335 (84.8\%) completed a 12-month follow-up. Intervention A stepped-care model for depression treatment was used by an off-site depression care team to make treatment recommendations via electronic medical record. The team included a nurse depression care manager, clinical pharmacist, and psychiatrist. The depression care manager communicated with patients via telephone and was supported by computerized decision support software.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The base case cost analysis included outpatient, pharmacy, and intervention expenditures. The effectiveness outcomes were depression-free days and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) calculated using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey standard gamble conversion formula.
RESULTS: The incremental depression-free days outcome was not significant (P = .10); therefore, further cost-effectiveness analyses were not done. The incremental QALY outcome was significant (P = .04) and the mean base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was \$85 634/QALY. Results adding inpatient costs were \$111 999/QALY to \$132 175/QALY.
CONCLUSIONS: In rural settings, a telemedicine-based collaborative care intervention for depression is effective and expensive. The mean base case result was \$85 634/QALY, which is greater than cost per QALY ratios reported for other, mostly urban, depression collaborative care interventions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Collaborative care for depression in primary care settings is effective and cost-effective. However, there is minimal evidence to support the choice of on-site versus off-site models. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of on-site practice-based collaborative care (PBCC) versus off-site telemedicine-based collaborative care (TBCC) for depression in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs).
METHODS: In a multisite, randomized, pragmatic comparative cost-effectiveness trial, 19,285 patients were screened for depression, 2,863 (14.8\%) screened positive, and 364 were enrolled. Telephone interview data were collected at baseline and at six, 12, and 18 months. Base case analysis used Arkansas FQHC health care costs, and secondary analysis used national cost estimates. Effectiveness measures were depression-free days and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from depression-free days, the 12-Item Short-Form Survey, and the Quality of Well-Being (QWB) Scale. Nonparametric bootstrap with replacement methods were used to generate an empirical joint distribution of incremental costs and QALYs and acceptability curves.
RESULTS: The TBCC intervention resulted in more depression-free days and QALYs but at a greater cost than the PBCC intervention. The disease-specific (depression-free day) and generic (QALY) incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were below their respective ICER thresholds for implementation, suggesting that the TBCC intervention was more cost effective than the PBCC intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support the cost-effectiveness of TBCC in medically underserved primary care settings. Information about whether to insource (make) or outsource (buy) depression care management is important, given the current interest in patient-centered medical homes, value-based purchasing, and bundled payments for depression care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The optimization of a diagnosis process and fluency in the Health Care sector in Romania. A key to discover this complex process was to determine a correlation between the physicians and the use of information technology, on one side and the patients' perspective on the other.
HYPOTHESIS: Integrating information technology in a physician's activity will lead to lower costs and less time spent while diagnosing patients. Using the electronic medical records and introducing a unified database with the patients' medical histories will make the process of diagnosis easier.
METHODS: We studied the diagnosis from the point of view of 304 patients in a public hospital and 320 physicians working there.
RESULTS: We believed that time and accessibility to different physicians makes the diagnosis process a burden for a patient and implicitly lead to dissatisfaction with health care services. We supposed that the burden of diagnosis for physicians comes from the lack of Internet connection and computer usage knowledge. We have found out that most physicians know how to use the computer at an intermediate level and have access to Internet, online journals and databases and do not use emails to a higher extent to communicate to other specialists, but do not rely entirely on the electronic medical records. Most physicians think that it is not technology, which stands in the way of proper and fast diagnosis but the financing and the paper work from the Romanian health system. Solutions that might be taken into account to entirely motivate physicians to use electronic medical records are: 1. Adjustments can be made to the computer software interface in order to make the design more consistent (to eliminate the paper forms) and user friendly. 2. Physicians can be provided with more training and knowledge.
DISCUSSION: After some statistical tests have been applied to find a correlation between the chosen variables, we have reached the conclusion that the results are encouraging and there is no correlation between the degree of the impact of Preventive Medicine and the healthy behavior of the respondents.},

METHODS: We performed a randomized two-period crossover trial comparing in-person (IP) consultation with telemedicine (TM) consultation in the management of chronic pain. Over an 18-month period, 26 patients each completed two diaries capturing their direct and indirect travel costs, daily pain scores, and satisfaction with physician consultation. Costing models were developed to account for direct, indirect, fixed, and variable costs in order to perform break-even analyses. Sensitivity analysis was performed over a broad range of assumptions.
RESULTS: Direct patient costs were significantly lower in the TM group than in the IP group, with median cost and interquartile range 133 dollars (28-377) vs 443 dollars (292-1075), respectively (P = 0.001). More patients were highly satisfied with the TM consultation than with the IP consultation (56 and 24\%, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05). Break-even annual patient volume was estimated at 57 patients. A two-way sensitivity analysis controlling for annual patient volume and round-trip distance indicated that TM remains cost-effective at volumes {\textgreater}50 patients/year or at round-trip distances {\textgreater}200 km.
CONCLUSION: Telemedicine is cost-effective over a broad range of assumptions, including annual patient volumes, travel distance, fuel costs, amortization, and discount rates. This study provides data from a real-world setting to determine relevant thresholds and targets for establishing a TM program for patients who are undergoing chronic pain therapy.},

Then we collected ECG, blood pressure, temperature, concentration of glucose in blood, SPO2, body position, airflow, height and weight through our developed model. Moreover, we designed a server for storing the recorded signal from the patients in order to treat them by health care professionals. Finally, this model is successfully tested with the patients of Marie Stopes Bangladesh Hospital Dhaka.
RESULTS: We have removed noise from the recorded signal successfully through our developed hardware and software based techniques. Real time data were visualized to the expert doctor in order to prescribe them through our model.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support that rural patient vital information can be collected in an automated way through the advanced model. Both rural and urban doctors can share and exchange patient information more effectively for the treatment of patient.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, the diagnosis of prevalent diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, or diarrheal diseases in rural areas of developing countries requires the displacement of the patient from their community health post to their reference health center or to ship a sample. This delays diagnosis and the treatment of disease.
OBJECTIVE: Conduct research to develop a new method for rapid low-cost diagnosis of prevalent diseases in rural areas of developing countries (malaria, tuberculosis, parasitic infections, vaginal infections, and cervical cancer).
METHODS: The study was divided into three phases. The first related to the drafting and validating of new protocols for the preparation of samples that should be adapted to be carried out in areas without power and with little trained personnel. The second phase consisted of developing a telemicroscopy system looking for low cost, software compatibility, and technical quality. Finally, the third phase evaluated the system as a diagnostic tool using direct observation with a conventional microscope as the gold standard.
RESULTS: The validation of the new protocols showed that 100\% of the vaginal swabs were processed correctly when using direct smear, while they were only 86.3\% correct when using Gram stain; 68.3\% of fecal samples were correctly processed using Kinyoun stain; 61.7\% of blood samples when using thin film; and 83.8\% when using thick film. Phase 2 permitted the development of a low-cost ({\textless}\$250) and low-power ({\textless}15 W) telemicroscopy system that allows real-time consultation between health technicians and specialists. Finally, phase 3 proved that there was no difference between the diagnostics obtained by direct observation in a microscope and those ones obtained through the new telemicroscopy system.
CONCLUSIONS: This study has verified the effectiveness of the telemicroscopy system as a diagnostic tool, given the complete agreement between the diagnoses made with it and those made with the gold standard.},

The clinic is a Veterans Affairs (VA) Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center clinical demonstration project. It is located in the Pittsburgh VA Healthcare System tertiary referral hospital and serves veterans in affiliated rural community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). Rural CBOC primary care providers refer clinic patients, or referral is according to previous cognitive impairment diagnosis in a VAPHS geriatric clinic. Patients undergo interprofessional dementia assessment by a geriatrician, geropsychologist, geriatric psychiatrist or neurologist, and social worker using CVT technology. Metrics for clinic evaluation included rural patients served and savings in travel time, distance, and costs. Assessments collected depended upon individual presentation and included cognitive tests, geriatric depression scales, functional assessment, and the Zarit Burden Interview. A patient satisfaction survey was created and administered. In the first year, 95 individuals were served in 156 clinic visits and 251 interprofessional provider encounters. Of patients served, 61 lived in rural ZIP codes, 72 were diagnosed with dementia, 19 were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, and four were found to have primarily psychiatric diagnoses rather than cognitive impairment. The average Functional Assessment Staging of Alzheimer's Disease Scale score was 4.3 ± 1.3. This clinic model demonstrates that CVT technology is a feasible means of providing interprofessional dementia evaluations and follow-up to rural presidents.},

METHODS: Thirty-eight individuals with SMI received the automated telehealth intervention for 6 months. Psychiatric symptoms, illness self-management, and self-reported service use (emergency room visits and hospital admissions) were collected at baseline, 3- and 6-months. Measures of quality of life, health indicators, and subjective health status were also collected.
RESULTS: Participants demonstrated improvements in self-reported psychiatric symptoms and illness self-management skills, an 82\% decrease in hospital admissions (from 76 to 14 hospitalizations, p {\textless} 0.001) and a 75\% decrease in emergency room visits (from 63 to 16 visits, p {\textless} 0.001).

Some patients felt more comfortable with video visits than office visits and expressed a preference for receiving future serious news via video visit, because they could be in their own supportive environment. Primary concerns with video visits were privacy, including the potential for work colleagues to overhear conversations, and questions about the ability of the clinician to perform an adequate physical examination.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary care video visits are acceptable in a variety of situations. Patients identified convenience, efficiency, communication, privacy, and comfort as domains that are potentially important to consider when assessing video visits vs in-person encounters. Future studies should explore which patients and conditions are best suited for video visits.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: For economic reasons, i.e., to reduce costs of in-hospital patient accommodations, constant pressure has been applied in recent years to increase the percentage of ambulatory surgeries. Effective control of post-operative pain after ambulatory surgery is challenging to all health professionals. Computerised systems are being implemented more frequently for remote patient monitoring, including during the at-home post-operative period.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the feasibility of delivering a computerised system, developed in-house, for remote pain monitoring. It evaluates the user-friendliness of the system and the extent of patient compliance. Finally, a comparative assessment of the system is made with respect to the quality of pain treatment in ambulatory surgery.
METHODS: The participants included 32 adults, aged 18-75, randomly assigned to a control group or to a computerised treatment group. The primary treatment outcome was measured by pain intensity ratings (0-10 NRS) reported several times per day during a five-day monitoring period, using an electronic pain diary combined with a web-based personal health record.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated the feasibility and suitability of the proposed system for pain management. Its handling was user-friendly, without requiring advanced skill or prior experience. In addition, the results showed that the guidance of health care professionals is essential to patients' satisfaction and positive experience with the system. There were no significant group differences with respect to improvements in the quality of pain treatment; however, this can be explained by the low pain scores registered in both groups, related to the type of surgical interventions recruited and the degrees of pain that are easily treated. To evaluate the benefits from a patient-centred perspective, studies of major ambulatory surgeries or of patients in chronic pain, including oncologic and non-oncologic pain resistant to treatment, are necessary.},

	abstract = {Telecare is advocated in most European countries with great, if not grandiose, promises: improving healthcare, lowering costs, solving workforce shortage. This paper does not so much question these specific promises, but rather the 'register of promising' as such, by comparing the promises with actual processes of incorporating technologies in healthcare practices. The case we study is the use of webcams in follow-up care from a Dutch rehabilitation clinic for people with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This process shows many changes and contingencies, and corresponding shifts in goals and aims. The conclusion is that when innovative technologies such as telecare are actually put to work, 'the same' technology will perform differently. In order to function at all, technology has to be tamed, it has to be tinkered with to fit the practices of the users. The technology, however, is not meekly put to use (tamed), but is unleashed as well, affecting care practices in unforeseen ways. The untenability of pre-given promises and the fluidity of locally evolving goals has important implications for the way in which innovations are promoted, as well as for the way innovative technologies may be evaluated.},

To ease this situation, the government has allocated a certain amount of funds, introduced through the Pediatric Cardiothoracic Program (PCP), in which the patients are transported to the Narayana Health Institute of Cardiac Science (NH) in India to receive a heart operation following an eligibility check at MediAssist4U Sdn Bhd in Selangor, Malaysia, a facility appointed by the NH. This study aimed to determine the demographic incidence of congenital heart diseases of patients in this program and to evaluate the outcome of the program in association with post-operative mortality rate and the beneficial factors of the program. In this study, 241 patients who participated in this program from August 2008 to September 2012 were reviewed. Fisher's exact tests were applied to calculate p-values of categorical data. Out of 241, 11 patients were rejected because of their poor health condition for flight transportation to India, leaving 230 patients for analysis. The majority of patients were 1 to 4 years of age (57.8\%), Malays (61.7\%), from families of monthly household income less than RM 1,500 (86.5\%) and with primary school-educated parents (86.5\%). Patients could apply from any government hospital in Malaysia, but 34.8\% of the patients were from the state of Johor. The region (Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia) of patients seeking pediatric cardiac services was significantly associated with race (p{\textless}0.001), low household income (p{\textless}0.001) and low education background of parents (p=0.004). The associations between the age group and diagnosis group (p=0.010) and between duration of hospitalization and outcome of medical management (p=0.013) were significant. Post-operative mortality rate was 1.7\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.5-4.4). In conclusion, the patients and the government were considered to have benefited from the PCP.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an efficient method for treating respiratory failure in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, it requires a process of adaptation not always achieved due to poor compliance. The role of telemonitoring of NIV is not yet established.
OBJECTIVES: To test the advantage of using modem communication in NIV of ALS patients.
DESIGN: Prospective, single blinded controlled trial. Population and methods According to their residence, 40 consecutive ventilated ALS patients were assigned to one of two groups: a control group (G1, n=20) in which compliance and ventilator parameter settings were assessed during office visits; or an intervention group (G2, n=20) in which patients received a modem device connected to the ventilator. The number of office and emergency room visits and hospital admissions during the entire span of NIV use and the number of parameter setting changes to achieve full compliance were the primary outcome measurements.
RESULTS: Demographic and clinical features were similar between the two groups at admission. No difference in compliance was found between the groups. The incidence of changes in parameter settings throughout the survival period with NIV was lower in G2 (p{\textless}0.0001) but it was increased during the initial period needed to achieve full compliance. The number of office or emergency room visits and inhospital admissions was significantly lower in G2 (p{\textless}0.0001). Survival showed a trend favouring G2 (p=0.13).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that telemonitoring reduces health care utilisation with probable favourable implications on costs, survival and functional status.},

Acute, unscheduled care includes acute illnesses (eg, nausea and vomiting), injuries, or exacerbations of chronic conditions (eg, worsening dyspnea in congestive heart failure) and is delivered in emergency departments, urgent care centers, and physicians' offices, as well as through telemedicine. We began with a literature search to define an acute episode of care and to identify existing conceptual models used in health care. In accordance with this information, we then drafted a preliminary conceptual model and collected stakeholder feedback, using online focus groups and concept mapping. Two technical expert panels reviewed the draft model, examined the stakeholder feedback, and discussed ways the model could be improved. After integrating the experts' comments, we solicited public comment on the model and made final revisions. The final conceptual model includes social and individual determinants of health that influence the incidence of acute illness and injury, factors that affect care-seeking decisions, specific delivery settings where acute care is provided, and outcomes and costs associated with the acute care system. We end with recommendations for how researchers, policymakers, payers, patients, and providers can use the model to identify and prioritize ways to improve acute care delivery.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of a suicide helpline in Belgium, consisting of a telephone- and a chat service. An age- and gender-dependent Markov model with a ten-year time horizon and a one-year cycle length was developed, assuming a societal perspective, to predict cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in the helpline users. The model included six transition states: the initial state (at risk), first attempt, re-attempt, follow-up, suicide and death from other causes. Data on the effect of the helpline and costs associated with model states were obtained from the literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to capture uncertainty. In addition, the budget impact of the helpline was analysed. Over ten years, the telephone- as well as the chat service could avoid about 36\% of suicides and attempts in this high-risk population. In males, 0.063 QALYs (95\% confidence interval, CI 0.030-0.097) and 0.035 QALYs (95\%CI -0.026-0.096) were gained by users of the telephone- and chat service respectively. The corresponding values for females were 0.019 QALYs (95\%CI -0.015-0.052) and a QALY-neutral result of -0.005 (95\%CI -0.071-0.062). There were net societal savings of respectively €2382 (95\%CI 1953-2859) and €2282 (95\%CI 1855-2758) in male users; €2171 (95\%CI 1735-2664) and €2458 (95\%CI 1945-3025) in female users. At the population level, an investment of €218,899 saved €1,452,022 for the public health service (national health insurance), mainly due to the telephone service. The analysis predicted that both means of telemedicine for suicide prevention in Flanders are cost-saving, and have a modest effect on QALYs.},

Using acustom Android mobile application, our device computes Pulse Wave Velocity(PWV) using the pulse signals from photo-plethysmographic (PPG) probes, which are simultaneously clipped onto the ear, index finger, and big toe of a human subject. Unlike other designs which require the use of an ECG reference, our mobile device uses only PPG signals and is entirely powered by the mobile phone via the USB port. Using the ear signal as a reference, we derived PWV values from two locations: the right index finger, and the right big toe.We present data from a recent clinical study with 78 participants (age 26 to 74) who were divided into three groups: Coronary Arterial Disease ("CAD"), hypertensive group ("PreCAD"), and Healthy controls. The CAD group was clinically diagnosed and confirmed with a CT-scan and calcium scoring. PWV values derived from the finger was found to have too much variance to be clinically useful. However, PWV values derived from the toe location showed significant differences between the groups, even after accounting for age. Measured PWV values were: 10.07 (8.51-12.01) for the older CAD group, 9.39 (7.44-9.75) for the younger CAD group, 8.26 (7.26-9.22) for the older Pre-CAD group, 10.57 m/s (8.5-11.2) for the younger Pre-CAD group, 7.13 m/s (5.97-7.69) for older healthy controls, and 6.71 m/s (4.86-7.26) for the younger healthy control subjects. These results demonstrate good potential value of this mobile PWV device as a simple low-cost screening tool for atherosclerosis and coronary arterial disease.},

Shifting from hospital or community dwelling care towards a home personalized healthcare paradigm would promote active aging with a better quality of life, along with a reduction in healthcare-related costs.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the SMARTA project was to develop and test an innovative personal health system integrating standard sensors as well as innovative wearable and environmental sensors to allow home telemonitoring of vital parameters and detection of anomalies in daily activities, thus supporting active aging through remote healthcare.
METHODS: A first phase of the project consisted in the definition of the health and environmental parameters to be monitored (electrocardiography and actigraphy, blood pressure and oxygen saturation, weight, ear temperature, glycemia, home interaction monitoring - water tap, refrigerator, and dishwasher), the feedbacks for the clinicians, and the reminders for the patients. It was followed by a technical feasibility analysis leading to an iterative process of prototype development, sensor integration, and testing. Once the prototype had reached an advanced stage of development, a group of 32 volunteers - including 15 healthy adult subjects, 13 elderly people with cardiac diseases, and 4 clinical operators - was recruited to test the system in a real home setting, in order to evaluate both technical reliability and user perception of the system in terms of effectiveness, usability, acceptance, and attractiveness.
RESULTS: The testing in a real home setting showed a good perception of the SMARTA system and its functionalities both by the patients and by the clinicians, who appreciated the user interface and the clinical governance system. The moderate system reliability of 65-70\% evidenced some technical issues, mainly related to sensor integration, while the patient's user interface showed excellent reliability (100\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Both elderly people and clinical operators considered the SMARTA system a promising and attractive tool for improving patients' healthcare while reducing related costs and preserving quality of life. However, the moderate reliability of the system should prompt further technical developments in terms of sensor integration and usability of the clinical operator's user interface.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 624 chronically ill primary care patients in Honduras were surveyed. We examined variation in telephone access across groups defined by patients' sociodemographic characteristics, diagnoses, and access to care. Logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of patients' interest in automated telephonic support for disease management.
RESULTS: participants had limited education (mean 4.8 years), and 65\% were unemployed. Eighty-four percent had telephone access, and 78\% had cell phones. Most respondents had voicemail (61\%) and text messaging (58\%). Mobile technologies were particularly common among patients who had to forego clinic visits and medications due to cost concerns (each p {\textless} 0.05). Most patients ({\textgreater}80\%) reported that they would be willing to receive automated calls focused on appointment reminders, medication adherence, health status monitoring, and self-care education. Patients were more likely to be willing to participate in automated telemedicine services if they had to cancel a clinic appointment due to transportation problems or forego medication due to cost pressures.
CONCLUSIONS: even in this poor region of Honduras, most chronically ill patients have access to mobile technology, and most are willing to participate in automated telephone disease management support. Given barriers to in-person care, new models of mobile healthcare should be developed for chronically ill patients in developing countries.},

Methods: Prior to being randomized to receive one year of either the Care Partners for Depression (CP-D) intervention or usual care alone, depressed patients from primary care clinics serving primarily low-income populations in rural and urban Michigan select a supportive adult from outside their home (their "Care Partner;" CP) to assist them in their depression self-management. In the CP-D arm, patients receive weekly automated telephone calls that provide monitoring and self-management guidance, CPs receive emailed guidance on supporting the patient's self-management based on patient-reported information, and primary care providers receive notifications about any urgent issues. At Baseline, Month 6, and Month 12, we assess depressive symptom severity (primary outcome) and several secondary outcomes.
Conclusion: To date, this is the only mHealth intervention for any psychiatric condition that involves a patient-selected support person. If it proves effective and cost-efficient, a new sustainable intervention would be available to patients with significant depressive symptoms, providing new management alternatives for patients who are medically underserved or socially isolated.},

METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cohort study using the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan database. Patients implanted with a CIED between March 31, 2009, and April 1, 2012, were included. All-cause hospitalization events were compared between those using RM and those not using RM by using Cox proportional hazards methods with Andersen-Gill extension and propensity scoring. We also compared health care costs (payments {\textgreater}30 days after CIED implantation).
RESULTS: Overall, there were 92,566 patients (mean age 72 ± 13 years; 58,140 [63\%] men) with a mean follow-up of 19 ± 12 months, including 54,520 (59\%) pacemaker, 27,816 (30\%) implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and 10,230 (11\%) cardiac resynchronization therapy patients. Only 37\% of patients (34,259) used RM. Patients with RM had Charlson Comorbidity Index values similar to those not using RM but had lower adjusted risk of all-cause hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.82; 95\% confidence interval 0.80-0.84; P {\textless} .001) and shorter mean length of hospitalization (5.3 days vs 8.1 days; P {\textless} .001) during follow-up. RM was associated with a 30\% reduction in hospitalization costs (\$8720 mean cost per patient-year vs \$12,423 mean cost per patient-year). For every 100,000 patient-years of follow-up, RM was associated with 9810 fewer hospitalizations, 119,000 fewer days in hospital, and \$370,270,000 lower hospital payments.
CONCLUSION: RM is associated with reductions in hospitalization and health care utilization. Since only about a third of patients with CIEDs routinely use RM, this represents a major opportunity for quality improvement.},

However, the question is: do the ways healthcare technologies are designed and developed support and improve healthcare services for those who need it the most? Survey data from our study point toward health informatics challenges in reaching the people who are considered in 'health risk' group, who, in this study, are interpreted as people with low level of education. The study shows that this group is less likely to use and communicate through health information technologies (HIT) and is generally more sceptical towards the benefits of HIT. We conclude that there is a need to pay specific attention to the patient groups that are socio-economically and health wise weakest during HIT design and development. It would also provide equality and equity in digital health intervention and access to healthcare for them in the future.},

The application of telephone consultation for immediate management is needed as most neurosurgeons are technology orientated. This enables a specialist at a remote mobile site to receive the necessary information and reduce transmission time, from the second the patient is seen till the management is obtained.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a survey on smartphone ownership among doctors and gathered cases that needed neurosurgical input from 1(st) November 2012 till 30(th) April 2013 from all 24 district hospitals in Sabah, Malaysia.
RESULTS: The percentage of smartphone ownership among doctors surveyed and usage of it for remote and daily medicine at various departments at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kota Kinabalu, which shows at least 90\% smartphone ownership and proves 100\% ownership of cross-platform instant messaging applications and its usage for remote and daily medicine. It also proves to be a more popular mode of referral compared to "teleconsultation" (TC).
DISCUSSION: In Sabah, the TC service is used for remote medical consultation and only available at four hospitals. The sender needs direct access to a computer with the TC software, and it causes delay whereas doctors using smartphones will just need to discuss the case on the spot and obtain the appropriate management within minutes. Smartphone usage is also important in daily neurosurgery especially at the department level to promote efficient communication, organization, and interaction between all the staff. As for the department's administrative sector, it is useful to notify if anyone is on leave, attending courses or even meetings as the shortage can be avoided, and redistribution easily done. It also allows us to transfer simple intra-departmental data at any time, and any place whenever required.
CONCLUSION: With all the given fact, it is clear that a day without utilizing this service in our daily life will leave us handicapped and struggling with time and resources.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In the SAVE-trial we evaluated the safety, reliability and improvements of patient management using the BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring®-System (HM) in pacemaker (PM) and implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients.
DESIGN: 115 PM (Module A) and 36 ICD-patients (Module B) were recruited 3 months after implantation.
PATIENTS: 65 patients in Module A were randomised to HM-OFF and had one scheduled outpatient clinic follow-up(FU) per year, whereas patients randomised to HM-ON were equipped with the mobile transmitter and discharged without any further scheduled in-office FU. In Module B 18 patients were randomised to HM-OFF and followed by standard outpatient clinic controls every 6 months; 18 patients were randomised to HM-ON receiving remote monitoring plus one outpatient clinic visit per year; unscheduled follow-ups were performed when necessary.
RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 17.1 ± 9.2 months in Module A and 26.3 ± 8.6 months in Module B. In both modules, the number of FUs per year was significantly reduced (Module A HM-ON 0.29 ± 0.6 FUs/year vs HM-OFF 0.53 ± 0.5 FUs/year; p b 0.001; Module B HM-ON 0.87 ± 0.25 vs HM-OFF 1.73 ± 0.53 FU/year,p b 0.001). Cost analysis was significantly lower in the HM-ON group compared to the HM-OFF group (18.0 ± 41.3 and 22.4 ± 26.9 € respectively; p b 0.003). 93\% of the unscheduled visits in Module B were clinically indicated,whereas 55\% of the routine FUs were classified as clinically unnecessary.
CONCLUSION: Remote home monitoring of pacemaker and ICD devices was safe, reduced overall hospital visits, and detected events that mandated unscheduled visits.},

SUMMARY: Beginning in 2014, clinical pharmacy specialists at a regional VA Telehealth Hub based at Boise VA Medical Center in Idaho have provided telehealth services for 16 clinics. In one telehealth model, a pharmacist and other remotely located primary care team members (a medical provider, a medical support assistant, a social worker, and a psychologist) conduct telehealth visits with veterans located at VA clinics, with support provided by clinic-based nursing staff; this model has been used to improve medication management services for veterans in sparsely populated areas. In the second VA telehealth model, a remotely located pharmacist uses telehealth technology to participate in clinical encounters along with primary care team members located at the patient site; this model allows on-demand remote coverage in the event of planned or unplanned absences of clinic-based pharmacists. Since the Telehealth Hub was established, pharmacists have engaged in video encounters and provided other telehealth-based clinical services to more than 1,200 veterans with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and other chronic conditions.
CONCLUSION: Within the VA healthcare system, telehealth technology has been demonstrated to be a cost-effective and well-received means of providing clinical pharmacy services in rural areas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hearing loss can affect approximately 15\% of the pediatric population and up to 40\% of the adult population. The gold standard of treatment for hearing loss is amplification of hearing thresholds by means of a hearing aid instrument. A hearing aid is an electronic device equipped with a topology of only three major components of aggregate cost. The gold standard of hearing aid fittings is face-to-face appointments in hearing aid centers, clinics, or hospitals. Telefitting encompasses the programming and adjustments of hearing aid settings remotely. Fitting hearing aids remotely is a relatively simple procedure, using minimal computer hardware and Internet access.
OBJECTIVE: This project aimed to examine the feasibility and outcomes of remote hearing aid adjustments (telefitting) by assessing patient satisfaction via the Portuguese version of the Satisfaction With Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) questionnaire.
METHODS: The Brazilian Portuguese version of the SADL was used in this experimental research design. Participants were randomly selected through the Rehabilitation Clinical (Espaco Reouvir) of the Otorhinolaryngology Department Medical School University of Sao Paulo. Of the 8 participants in the study, 5 were female and 3 were male, with a mean age of 71.5 years. The design consisted of two face-to-face sessions performed within 15 working days of each other. The remote assistance took place 15 days later.
RESULTS: The average scores from this study are above the mean scores from the original SADL normative data. These indicate a high level of satisfaction in participants who were fitted remotely.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of an evaluation questionnaire is a simple yet effective method to objectively assess the success of a remote fitting. Questionnaire outcomes can help hearing stakeholders improve the National Policy on Hearing Health Care in Brazil. The results of this project indicated that patient satisfaction levels of those fitted remotely were comparable to those fitted in the conventional manner, that is, face-to-face.},

This revolutionary shift makes the patient the consumer of health care and empowers patients to be the driving force of management of their own health through mobile devices and wearable technology. This article presents an overview of technology as it pertains to clinical practice considerations. Telemedicine is changing the way clinical care is delivered without regard for proximity to the patient, whereas nonclinical telehealth applications affect distance education for consumers or clinicians, meetings, research, continuing medical education, and health care management. Technology has the potential to reduce administrative burdens and improve both efficiency and quality of care delivery in the clinic. Finally, the potential for telehealth approaches as cost-effective ways to improve adherence to treatment is explored. As telehealth advances, health care providers must understand the fundamental framework for applying telehealth strategies to incorporate into successful clinical practice.},

AIMS: To evaluate the Deep South IVR-supported Active Lifestyle (DIAL) intervention.
METHOD: A pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted among 63 underactive adults in Birmingham, Alabama, from 2015 to 2017.
RESULTS: Retention was 88.9\% at 12 weeks, and ≥75\% adherence (IVR contact on at least 63 out of 84 days) was noted among 62.5\% of intervention participants. Intervention participants reported larger increases in self-reported minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity from baseline to 12 weeks than the wait-list control arm (median change = 47.5 vs. 5.0 minutes, respectively, p = .09). Moreover, the intervention produced significantly greater increases in physical activity self-regulation ( p {\textless} .001) and social support from family ( p = .001) and friends ( p = .009) from baseline to 12 weeks, compared with the wait-list control. Significant decreases in self-reported sleep disturbance also were found in the intervention arm but not among the controls, p {\textless} .05. Overall, intervention participants reported being satisfied with the DIAL program (71.4\%) and would recommend it to friends (92.9\%).
DISCUSSION: Findings support the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the DIAL intervention.
CONCLUSION: Next steps include intervention refinement in preparation for a fully powered efficacy trial and eventual dissemination to rural counties.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two studies were simultaneously conducted: A randomized and a matched-cohort study. In the randomized study, 168 subjects were randomly assigned (after hospitalization) to home care utilizing RPM (live nursing visits and video-based nursing visits) or to home care receiving live nursing visits only. In the matched-cohort study, 160 subjects receiving home care with RPM (live nursing visits and video-based nursing visits) were matched with home care subjects receiving live nursing visits only.
RESULTS: Regardless of whether outcomes were being analyzed for all subjects (intention to treat) or for hospitalized subjects only, hospitalization rates, time to first admission, length of stay, and costs to Medicare did not differ significantly between groups in either study at 30 or 90 days after enrollment. A notable trend, however, emerged across studies: Although time to hospitalization was shorter in the RPM groups than the control groups, RPM groups had lower hospitalization costs.
CONCLUSIONS: RPM, when utilized in conjunction with a robust management protocol, was not found to significantly differ from live nursing visits in the management of HF in home care. Shorter hospitalization times and lower associated costs may be due to earlier identification of exacerbation. These trends indicate the need for further study.},

In order to improve health care system efficiency, we must have a better understanding of this population and identify areas for education and capacity building.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients (aged 0-17 years) who were transferred from community ED to a pediatric ED from November 2013 to November 2014. The primary outcome was the frequency of referred patients who were discharged home from the pediatric ED.
RESULTS: Two hundred four patients were transferred from community EDs in the study period. One hundred thirteen children (55.4\%) were discharged home from the pediatric ED. Presence of inpatient pediatric services (P = 0.04) at the referral hospital and a respiratory diagnosis (P = 0.03) were independently associated with admission to the children's hospital. In addition, 74 patients (36.5\%) had no critically abnormal vital signs at the referral hospital and did not require any special tests, interventions, consultations, or admission to the children's hospital. Younger age (P = 0.03), lack of inpatient pediatric services (P = 0.04), and a diagnosis change (P = 0.03) were independently associated with this outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of patients transferred to the pediatric tertiary care ED did not require admission, and more than one third did not require special tests, interventions, consults, or admission. Many of these patients were likely transferred for a second opinion from a pediatric emergency medicine specialist. Education and real-time videoconferencing consultations using telemedicine may help to reduce the frequency of transfers for a second opinion and contribute to cost savings over the long term.},

PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with HF aged 65 and older (mean age 80) randomly assigned to intervention (n = 50) or control (n = 46). Participants had an average ejection fraction of 46\%.
INTERVENTION: Telemonitoring system (receives and communicates oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure readings) and office-hours telephonic support provided by a geriatrician.
MEASUREMENTS: Combination of all-cause death and hospital admissions.
RESULTS: The two groups were similar with the exception of the prevalence of women and of disability (both more common in the control group). Three patients for each group were lost to follow-up (final analyzed sample size: 90). Incidence of the main outcome was 42\% in the control group and 21\% in the intervention group (relative risk = 0.51, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.26-0.98). The results were unchanged after taking into account the setting of enrollment, sex, and disability (hazard ratio = 0.42, 95\% CI = 0.19-0.94).
CONCLUSION: Telemonitoring of elderly people with HF is feasible and reduces the risk of death and hospitalization. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the cost-efficacy of the service.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Close, multidisciplinary collaboration with burn experts is the essential strategy to achieve the best functional and esthetic outcomes in burn wound treatment. Management of minor burn injuries, where no specialized care is available, might be challenging. One concept to achieve a fast and timely result is the application of telemedicine. The objective of this study was to assess and develop a simple telemedicine protocol, which can be applied globally.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present a pilot study based on a pediatric population of four patients with minor burns. Based on the severity and burn area, two cases of ambulant pediatric patients (mean 1\% total body surface area, superficial and deep 2° burn) with minor burn injuries met study criteria and were enrolled. A pediatrician performed the initial assessment, followed by plastic surgery video consultation, using telephone's digital camera. Treatment protocols were designed to optimize outcomes. After the initial treatment phase, which took place at a nonteaching local hospital in Poland from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2014, clinical follow-up was performed by a plastic surgeon via smartphone in the United States.
RESULTS: We have achieved complete burn wound resolution, in all patients, with no scarring and only minor discoloration. A simple, reproducible treatment protocol was designed to include dressing changes and additional outpatient visits.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a telemedicine protocol allows for easy access to burn consultations, helps multidisciplinary collaboration, eases follow-ups, and shortens specialists' consult wait times. Real-time evaluation provides fast and flexible treatment, without long distance travels, for patients and their families. Telemedicine increases the frequency of follow-up, contributes to the esthetic outcome, and together with improved cost-effectiveness is beneficial for both the patient and healthcare system.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This research analyzes teleconsultation from both a mechanistic and complex adaptive system (CAS) dominant logic in order to further understand the influence of dominant logic on utilization rates of teleconsultation projects. In both dominant logics, the objective of teleconsultation projects is to increase access to and quality of healthcare delivery in a cost efficient manner. A mechanistic dominant logic perceives teleconsultation as closely resembling the traditional service delivery model, while a CAS dominant logic focuses on the system's emergent behavior of learning resulting from the relationships and interactions of participating healthcare providers.
METHODS: Qualitative case studies of 17 teleconsultation projects that were part of four health sciences center (HSC) based telemedicine networks was utilized. Data were collected at two points in time approximately 10 years apart. Semi-structured interviews of 85 key informants (clinicians, administrators, and IT professionals) involved in teleconsultation projects were the primary data collection method.
RESULTS: The findings indicated that the emergent behavior of effective and sustainable teleconsultation projects differed significantly from what was anticipated in a mechanistic dominant logic. Teleconsultation projects whose emergent behavior focused on continuous learning enabled remote site generalists to manage and treat more complex cases and healthcare problems on their own without having to refer to HSC specialists for assistance. In teleconsultation projects that continued to be effectively utilized, participant roles evolved and were expanded. Further, technology requirements for teleconsultation projects whose emergent behavior was learning did not need to be terribly sophisticated.
CONCLUSIONS: When a teleconsultation project is designed with a mechanistic dominant logic, it is less likely to be sustained, whereas a teleconsultation project designed with a CAS dominant logic is more likely to be sustained. Consistent with a CAS dominant logic, teleconsultation projects that continued to be utilized involved participants taking on new roles and continuously learning. This continuous learning enabled remote site generalists to better handle the constantly changing nature of the problems faced. A CAS dominant logic provides a theoretical framework which explains why the teleconsultation literature about the role of technology, which is based on a mechanistic dominate logic, does not have adequate explanatory power.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprised of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, affects 1.6 million people in the United States. Although effective medical treatments exist to treat the disease, outcomes are still suboptimal. The reasons for poor outcomes vary but include nonadherence to therapy, inadequate monitoring of patients, limited access to IBD specialty care, concurrent psychiatric disease, limited patient knowledge of the disease and treatments, and patient provider discordance. Telemedicine is a candidate intervention that can be used to improve patient outcomes through more frequent monitoring, patient self-management, delivery of education (patient and provider), and to increase access to multidisciplinary IBD care. Telemedicine includes remote monitoring, telehealth, teleconsultation, and teleconferencing.Telemedicine systems have been used in patients with IBD with widespread patient acceptance of the technology. However, early clinical trials demonstrated high attrition rates among intervention patients. In general, use of telemedicine systems have been associated with improved quality of life, improved patient knowledge, and decreased utilization of health care resources. Early studies evaluating telehealth visits report high patient satisfaction, decreased indirect costs to patients, and no decrease in quality of care delivered.Due to widespread access to computers and smart phones among patients, telemedicine will continue to expand in the care of patients with IBD. To optimize use and effectiveness of telemedicine, barriers for use including concerns over increased liability, need for informed consent, licensure restrictions to providing interstate telehealth visits, and cybersecurity need to be addressed.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This article proposes a novel, cost-effective, flexible, and easy-to-deploy wireless teleophthalmology network architecture and performance evaluation for its potential use in remote areas. This study has used practical telecommunication standards, which is widely deployed throughout India.
METHODS: In the proposed scenario, patient's eye images are obtained using a specified imaging modality, and then sent to a server at the primary eye care centre (PECC) using ZigBee a short-range wireless network. It is linked to the main server at the base eye hospital (BEH) through a GSM/UMTS (3G)/WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) network. After diagnostic evaluation of the eye image using various automated diagnostic software, data are sent to a physician in an urban center for further validation, which is connected through GSM/UMTS (3G)/WiMAX network. Performance evaluation of these wireless networks is carried out for their use in teleophthalmology application based on network parameters, namely throughput, average end-to-end delay, and average jitter. It is found that end-to-end delay is the most critical network parameter affecting overall quality of service (QoS) of the proposed teleophthalmology network.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that WiMAX is the most suitable network among the considered networks for connecting PECC nodes with BEH main server, and further connecting main server with a doctor on the move. It is also deduced that for a given set of QoS parameters, WiMAX supports a load capacity of 22,000 packets at center nodes and the main server and it performs well even when the mobility speed of doctor exceeds 200 KPH.},

	abstract = {Through their computational power and connectivity, smartphones are poised to rapidly expand telemedicine and transform healthcare by enabling better personal health monitoring and rapid diagnostics. Recently, a variety of platforms have been developed to enable smartphone-based point-of-care testing using imaging-based readout with the smartphone camera as the detector. Fluorescent reporters have been shown to improve the sensitivity of assays over colorimetric labels, but fluorescence readout necessitates incorporating optical hardware into the detection system, adding to the cost and complexity of the device. Here we present a simple, low-cost smartphone-based detection platform for highly sensitive luminescence imaging readout of point-of-care tests run with persistent luminescent phosphors as reporters. The extremely bright and long-lived emission of persistent phosphors allows sensitive analyte detection with a smartphone by a facile time-gated imaging strategy. Phosphors are first briefly excited with the phone's camera flash, followed by switching off the flash, and subsequent imaging of phosphor luminescence with the camera. Using this approach, we demonstrate detection of human chorionic gonadotropin using a lateral flow assay and the smartphone platform with strontium aluminate nanoparticles as reporters, giving a detection limit of ≈45 pg mL-1 (1.2 pM) in buffer. Time-gated imaging on a smartphone can be readily adapted for sensitive and potentially quantitative testing using other point-of-care formats, and is workable with a variety of persistent luminescent materials.},

PURPOSE: To analyze changes in the number of dermatologic mobile applications since 2012.
METHODS: We examined five mobile platforms (Apple, Android, Windows, Nokia, and Blackberry) for dermatology-related diagnoses applications. The apps were categorized by purpose, cost, and target audience.
RESULTS: A total of 365 dermatologic mobile applications were analyzed with 225 new mobile applications found since 2012. Since the last query, there was a decrease in market share of reference materials (26.6\% in 2012 to 15.9\% in 2014) and self-surveillance/diagnosis applications (17.9\% in 2012 to 12.9\% in 2014) while teledermatology apps increased from 3.5\% of total apps in 2012 to 9\% in 2014.

METHODS: Prospective randomized pilot study was used to examine video versus cellular communication between the medical command officer (MCO) and pediatric transport team (TT) for children with moderate to severe illness undergoing interhospital transport. Twenty-five patients were randomized to cellular communication, and 25 patients were randomized to video. The MCO completed a Likert scale to evaluate connection, quality, and ease of operation. Call durations were recorded. A Likert scale to evaluate the communication mode on patient care was completed.
RESULTS: Connection and audio quality were equivalent and there were no dropped calls. Average call duration in the phone group was 186 versus 139 seconds in the video group (P = 0.055). The MCO survey results were the following: 100\% found video intuitive, 92\% felt that disposition based on phone report was difficult, 80\% felt that video provided better understanding of patient condition, 70\% felt that video assisted disposition, and 80\% believe that video should be used for transport. The iPad system offers a significant savings when compared with conventional telemedicine.
CONCLUSIONS: Video conferencing seems as easy to complete as phone with equivalent quality and connectivity. Duration of video was equivalent to phone conferencing. Surveyed MCOs believed that video conferencing improved assessment and disposition. The iPad-based conferencing provided significant savings when compared with conventional cart-based or robotic units. Further evaluation of video conferencing during interhospital transport is warranted.},

	abstract = {Background Telerehabilitation promises to improve quality, increase patient access and reduce costs in health care. Physiotherapy with exercises is generally recommended to restore function after surgery in patients with chronic subacromial syndrome. Relatively few studies have investigated the feasibility of telerehabilitation interventions in musculoskeletal and orthopaedic disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a customizable telerehabilitation intervention and compare with traditional care. Methods This research includes 18 consecutive patients with subacromial impingement who underwent arthroscopic subacromial decompression in a controlled clinical prospective study. Patients were randomized to either a 12-week telerehabilitation programme or the usual face-to-face physical therapy for immediate postoperative rehabilitation. We have developed a telerehabilitation system to provide services to patients who have undergone shoulder arthroscopy. An independent blinded observer performed postoperative follow-up after 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Results The preliminary efficacy of this telerehabilitation programme in terms of both physical and functional objective outcome measures was assessed on eight patients. Using the Constant-Murley score to evaluate functional outcome, patients in the telerehabilitation group were shown to have improved from a mean 43.50 ± 3.21 points to a mean 68.50 ± 0.86 points after 12 weeks. The physical and functional improvements in the telerehabilitation group were similar to those in the control group ( p = 0.213). There was a non-significant trend for greater improvements in the telerehabilitation group for most outcome measurements. Conclusion The results of this study provide evidence for the efficacy of telerehabilitation after shoulder arthroscopy in shoulder impingement syndrome. A telerehabilitation programme with range of motion, strengthening of the rotator cuff and scapula stabilizers exercises seems to be similar and not inferior to traditional face-to-face physiotherapy after subacromial arthroscopic decompression. Through this study, we are developing our preliminary dataset to evaluate the efficacy of telerehabilitation programmes following surgical procedures in musculoskeletal injuries and for comparison with more traditional interventions.},

This has made it difficult to compare telehomecare with traditional home care for the chronic diseases studied. This economic analysis is an attempt to address this gap in the literature.
METHODS: We have analyzed the consumption of healthcare services by 95 patients with various chronic diseases over a 21-month period, that is, 12 months before, 4 months during home telemonitoring use, and over 5 months after withdraw of the technology.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate significant benefits to the home telemonitoring program as evidenced by large reductions in number of hospitalizations, length of average hospital stay, and, to a lesser extent, number of emergency room visits. Contrary to expectations, however, the number of home visits by nurses increased both during and after the telemonitoring intervention. In terms of the financial analysis, the telehomecare program resulted in significant savings: the equivalent of over CAD1,557 per patient as calculated on an annualized basis. This represents a net gain of 41 percent as compared to traditional home care.
CONCLUSIONS: While the present economic analysis led to positive results, additional assessments should be conducted to confirm the cost-effectiveness of this mode of care delivery.},

VISYTER is a secure integrated system that combines high-quality videoconferencing with access to electronic health records and other key tools in telerehabilitation such as stimuli presentation, remote multiple camera control, remote control of the display screen, and an eye contact teleprompter. The software platform is suitable for supporting low-volume services to homes, yet scalable to support high-volume enterprise-wide telehealth services. The VISYTER system has been used to develop a number of telerehabilitation applications, including a remote wheelchair prescription, adult autistic assessments, and international physical therapy teleconsultations. An evaluation of VISYTER for delivering a remote wheelchair prescription was conducted on 48 participants. Results of the evaluation indicate a high level of satisfaction from patients with the use of VISYTER. The versatility and cost-effectiveness of the platform has the potential for a wide range of telerehabilitation applications and potentially may lower the technical and economic barriers of telemedicine adoption.},

However, the details and complexities of establishing such a program in the United States are unknown. We describe the steps involved in setting up the first MSU in the United States.
METHODS: Implementation included establishing leadership, fund-raising, purchase and build-out, knitting a collaborative consortium of community stakeholders, writing protocols to ensure accountability, radiation safety, purchasing supplies, licensing, insurance, establishing a base station, developing a communication plan with city Emergency Medical Services, Emergency Medical Service training, staffing, and designing a research protocol.
RESULTS: The MSU was introduced after ≈1 year of preparation. Major obstacles to establishing the MSU were primarily obtaining funding, licensure, documenting radiation safety protocols, and establishing a smooth communication system with Emergency Medical Services. During an 8 week run-in phase, ≈2 patients were treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator per week, one-third within 60 minutes of symptom onset, with no complications. A randomized study to determine clinical outcomes, telemedicine reliability and accuracy, and cost effectiveness was formulated and has begun.
CONCLUSION: The first MSU in the United States has been introduced in Houston, TX. The steps needed to accomplish this are described.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with chronic conditions are vulnerable to secondary complications that can be prevented with adherence to self-care routines. They benefit most from receiving effective treatments beyond acute care, usually in the form of regular follow-up and self-care support in their living environments. One such population is individuals with spina bifida (SB), the most common permanently disabling birth defect in the United States. A Wellness Program at the University of Pittsburgh in which wellness coordinators supervise the care of individuals with chronic disease has produced remarkably improved outcomes. However, time constraints and travel costs have limited its scale. Mobile telehealth service delivery is a potential solution for improving access to care for a larger population.
OBJECTIVE: The project's goal was to develop and implement a novel mHealth system to support complex self-care tasks, continuous adherence to regimens, monitoring of adherence, and secure two-way communications between patients and clinicians.
METHODS: We developed and implemented a novel architecture of mHealth system called iMHere (iMobile Health and Rehabilitation) consisting of smartphone apps, a clinician portal, and a two-way communication protocol connecting the two. The process of implementing iMHere consisted of: (1) requirement analysis to identify clinically important functions that need to be supported, (2) design and development of the apps and the clinician portal, (3) development of efficient real-time bi-directional data exchange between the apps and the clinician portal, (4) usability studies on patients, and (5) implementation of the mHealth system in a clinical service delivery.
RESULTS: There were 9 app features identified as relevant, and 5 apps were considered priority. There were 5 app features designed and developed to address the following issues: medication, skin care, bladder self-catheterization, bowel management, and mental health. The apps were designed to support a patient's self-care tasks, send adherence data to the clinician portal, and receive personalized regimens from the portal. The Web-based portal was designed for clinicians to monitor patients' conditions and to support self-care regimens. The two-way communication protocol was developed to facilitate secure and efficient data exchange between the apps and the portal. The 3 phases of usability study discovered usability issues in the areas of self-care workflow, navigation and interface, and communications between the apps and the portal. The system was used by 14 patients in the first 6 months of the clinical implementation, with 1 drop out due to having a poor wireless connection. The apps have been highly utilized consistently by patients, even those addressing complex issues such as medication and skincare. The patterns of utilization showed an increase in use in the first month, followed by a plateau.
CONCLUSIONS: The system was capable of supporting self-care and adherence to regimen, monitoring adherence, supporting clinician engagement with patients, and has been highly utilized.},

At first glance, it is the familiar story of individuals solving problems that arise in their clinical practice to enhance efficiency, better manage (e.g., digitize) laboratory information, as well as exploit emerging information technologies. Under the surface, however, lie powerful resource, regulatory, and societal forces that helped shape our discipline into what it is today. In this monograph, for the first time in the history of our discipline, we collectively perform a global review of the field of pathology informatics. In doing so, we illustrate how general far-reaching trends such as the advent of computers, the Internet and digital imaging have affected pathology informatics in the world at large. Major drivers in the field included the need for pathologists to comply with national standards for health information technology and telepathology applications to meet the scarcity of pathology services and trained people in certain countries. Following trials by a multitude of investigators, not all of them successful, it is apparent that innovation alone did not assure the success of many informatics tools and solutions. Common, ongoing barriers to the widespread adoption of informatics devices include poor information technology infrastructure in undeveloped areas, the cost of technology, and regulatory issues. This review offers a deeper understanding of how pathology informatics historically developed and provides insights into what the promising future might hold.},

INTRODUCTION: Telehealth counseling was developed and tested for Korean expatriates. We explored the current status of using telehealth counseling systems and showed its feasibility and acceptability in three countries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was based on the "Development and demonstration of telehealth counseling program for overseas Koreans" project funded by the Korea Health Industry Development Institute. In this project, we established five Digital Healthcare Centers (DHCs): 3 in Vietnam and 1 each in Uzbekistan and Cambodia. We used data from October 2016 to September 2017; descriptive analysis and one-way ANOVA were used to present detailed information.
RESULTS: A total of 442 patients made an appointment for telehealth counseling services. Overall user satisfaction rates were 96.1\%. Over two thirds of patients (302/442, 68.3\%) completed one-time telehealth counseling. About 13\% were referred to primary care, and 17 (3.8\%) were referred to specialists or tertiary hospital. The most common diagnostic category was endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases (14\%), followed by diseases of the circulatory system (12.3\%) for one-time visit patients.
DISCUSSION: Our telehealth counseling program for expatriates was feasible and acceptable in three countries. It also has the potential to minimize language barriers and the cost of healthcare usage.
CONCLUSION: Further research for sustainable effective telehealth systems for expatriates will be needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Self blood pressure monitoring at home may improve blood pressure control and patients' compliance with treatment, but its implementation in daily practice faces difficulties. Teletransmission facilities may offer a more efficient approach to long-term home blood pressure monitoring.
METHODS: Twelve general practitioners screened 391 consecutive uncontrolled mild-moderate hypertensive patients (80\% treated), 329 of whom (58 +/- 11 years, 54\% men) were randomized to either usual care on the basis of office blood pressure (group A, n = 113) or to integrated care on the basis of teletransmitted home blood pressure (group B, n = 216). Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed at baseline and after 6 months, during which treatment was optimized according to either office (group A) or home (group B) blood pressure values. We compared differences between groups in the rate of daytime ambulatory blood pressure normalization ({\textless}130/80 mmHg), need of treatment changes during follow-up, quality of life scores, and healthcare costs.
RESULTS: Baseline office blood pressures were 149 +/- 12/89 +/- 9 and 148 +/- 13/89 +/- 7 mmHg in groups A (n = 111) and B (n = 187) respectively, the corresponding daytime values being 140 +/- 11/84 +/- 8 and 139 +/- 11/84 +/- 8 mmHg. The percentage of daytime blood pressure normalization was higher in group B (62\%) than in group A (50\%) (P {\textless} 0.05). There were less frequent treatment changes in group B than in group A (9 vs. 14\%, P {\textless} 0.05). Quality of life tended to be higher and costs lower in group B.
CONCLUSION: Patients' management based on home blood pressure teletransmission led to a better control of ambulatory blood pressure than with usual care, with a more regular treatment regimen.},

The aim of this pilot study was to examine how the safety and efficacy of the HM system in patients after ambulatory implanted primary CIEDs compare to patients with a standard procedure and hospitalization.
HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that HM and their modifications would be a useful extension of the present concepts for ambulatory implanted CIEDs.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis evaluates telemetric data obtained from 364 patients in an ambulatory single center over 6 years. Patients were assigned to an active group (n = 217), consisting of those who were discharged early on the day of implantation of the primary CIED, or to a control group (n = 147), consisting of those discharged and followed up with the HM system according to usual medical practices.
RESULTS: The mean duration of hospitalization was 73.2\% shorter in the active group than in the control group, corresponding to 20.5 ± 13 fewer hours (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 6.3-29.5; P {\textless} 0.01) spent in the hospital (7.5 ± 1.5 vs 28 ± 4.5 h). This shorter mean hospital stay was attributable to a 78.8\% shorter postoperative period in the active group. The proportion of patients with treatment-related adverse events was 11\% (n = 23) in the active group and 17\% (n = 25) in the control group (95\% CI: 5.5-8.3; P = 0.061). This 6\% absolute risk reduction (95\% CI: 3.3-9.1; P = 0.789) confirmed the noninferiority of the ambulatory implanted CIED when compared with standard management of these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Early discharge with the HM system after ambulatory CIED implantation was safe and not inferior to the classic medical procedure. Thus, together with lower costs, HM and its modifications would be a useful extension of the present concepts for ambulatory implanted CIEDs.},

The tele-ICU service (eICU(®)) at Health First Hospitals (Brevard County, FL) has provided tele-critical care support for patients outside the ICU using a mobile platform (the eMobile platform) since 2012. In this study we sought to evaluate the ability of eMobile to support care administered by RRTs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review evaluating mobile cart activations for RRT calls was performed. Data on mobile cart deployments were recorded over a 33-month period from January 2012 through September 2014.
RESULTS: Five hundred eighty mobile cart activations for critical care support were initiated by RRTs, and 577 were completed ({\textgreater}99\%). For recorded gender, 223 patients (47\%) were male, and 248 (53\%) patients were female. Mean recorded age was 70 ± 16 years (median, 72 years). The most common patient conditions were respiratory distress (n = 190, 33\%), altered mental status (n = 137, 24\%) and hypotension (n = 59, 10\%). The most common interventions were medication orders (n = 231, 40\%) and laboratory studies (n = 92, 29\%). For 566 eMobile calls with documented dispositions, 189 patients (33\%) were managed without ICU upgrade. No adverse patient outcomes were recorded involving eMobile. Compared with the RRT program in 2009, the last year before testing of eMobile began (2010-2011), addition of tele-critical care support for calendar years 2012 and 2013 increased projected cost avoidance from unnecessary ICU transfers by a mean of 66\% above the 2009 baseline. For Fiscal Year 2014, a projected cost avoidance analysis for unnecessary ICU transfers including costs of information technology (IT) support demonstrated a return on investment up to \$1.66 for every \$1 invested in IT support.
CONCLUSIONS: Mobile critical care coupled with RRT is clinically effective and can generate meaningful cost avoidance.},

However, organized integrated care of these different sectors of the German health care system is missing. This organizational deficit as well as non-adherence of kidney recipients and longterm cardiovascular complications are major reasons for an impaired patient and graft survival.
METHODS: The KTx360° study is supported by a grant from the Federal Joint Committee of the Federal Republic of Germany. The study will include 448 (39 children) incident patients of all ages with KTx after study start in May 2017 and 963 (83 children) prevalent patients with KTx between 2010 and 2016. The collaboration between transplant centers and nephrologists in private local practices will be supported by internet-based case-files and scheduled virtual visits (patient consultation via video conferencing). At specified points of the care process patients will receive cardiovascular and adherence assessments and respective interventions. Care will be coordinated by an additional case management. The goals of the study will be evaluated by an independent institute using claims data from the statutory health insurances and data collected from patients and their caregivers during study participation. To model longitudinal changes after transplantation and differences in changes and levels of immunosuppresive therapy after transplantation between study participants and historical data as well as data from control patients who do not participate in KTx360°, adjusted regression analyses, such as mixed models with repeated measures, will be used. Relevant confounders will be controlled in all analyses.
DISCUSSION: The study aims to prolong patient and graft survival, to reduce avoidable hospitalizations, co-morbidities and health care costs, and to enhance quality of life of patients after kidney transplantation.

This model basedon the results of Engel's studies in ulcerative colitis, depression and psychogenic pain, constituted a challenge for biomedicineand the biomedical model. The basic principles of the model included the biological, psychological and social dimensions of the person's life and theperception that the person suffers as a whole and not as isolated organs. The doctor should use a holistic approach regardingillness and should consider his/her relation with the patient socially equal. The personality and the emotional reserves of thepatient, as well as the particular environmental conditions in which the person lives in should be taken into account. There is no doubt that the biopsychosocial model has established a more empathetic and compassionate approach in medical practice. Already since 1936, the general adaptation syndrome had been proposed by the Austrian-Canadian endocrinologist HansSeley (1907-1982), who emphasized that psychological stressful factors may have injurious consequences on health, while theresponse systems to stress may be dysregulated not only by genetic factors, but also from experiences and stressful life events,as well as by harmful behaviors such as smoking, alcohol consumption and lack of physical exercise. Psychosocial factors may co-determine the patient's vulnerability and the illness's severity and course. The biopsychosocialmodel consider the interactions with genetic susceptibility, personality, stressful events and, generally, with the patient's socialcontext. Environmental factors increase the probability of the clinical expression of a mental disorder, play a role in the time ofonset of an illness's manifestation, and they can also protect a vulnerable person from the disease. Stressful experiences modify immunological response and influence treatment compliance. Non adherence to pharmacotherapy,as well as to the psychosocial interventions, may cause defective recovery of psychosocial functioning, recurrence ofthe disorder, as well as insufficient use of health resources and a higher health care cost. The psychoeducation of patients andtheir relatives by the application of the biopsychosocial model plays an important role in psychiatric therapeutics, and it mayalso be used via Internet in the frame of telepsychiatry. Results from neuroimaging studies have shown that the different kinds of human experiences, traumatic or therapeutic, havemeasurable influences on the brain function. Psychotherapy may modify the neuronal connections of the brain in the frame ofits plasticity, as was found by the discovery of synaptogenesis in response to learning and can, thus, be considered not only as astrictly psychological but also as a biopsychosocial form of treatment. Among the disadvantages of the biopsychosocial model have been reported the lack of a concise theoretical frameworkregarding its function and content, that it is complicated, difficulties in its coordination and assignment of responsibilities, aswell as problems with the education on it being multifaceted. The biopsychosocial model has been criticized that it does notconstitute a scientific or philosophical model, it does not provide an answer to the crucial question of how the biological, psychologicaland social variables interact in the disease's expression, that it does not provide guidance on the exact time of itsapplication and, finally, that it allows for a wide range of interventions without providing specific guidelines of a concrete therapeutic scheme. The person-centered diagnosis is based on the biopsychosocial model, connects science with humanism and uses all thepossible ways so that the clinicians, the patients and their families collaborate for a more effective management of the disease.This approach has been established by the World Psychiatric Association (WPA, 2007) as the program "Psychiatry for the Person". Psychiatry in everyday practice presents particularities versus other medical disciplines due to the complexity and polymorphismPsychiatry in everyday practice presents particularities versus other medical disciplines due to the complexity and polymorphismof the expression of mental disorders, their close relation to psychosocial factors, the lack of explicit pathognomonicelements and the stigmatization of mental illness. For these reasons, the biopsychosocial model is particularly applicable inpsychiatric disorders, but it should not be over looked also in somatic illnesses. The biopsychosocial model, despite the criticism it was subjected to, continues to offer valuable clinical, educational andresearch services, as well as to provide an important contribution to the formation of health policies, not only for psychiatry, butfor the whole of medicine as well.},

	abstract = {Whole slide imaging (WSI), or "virtual" microscopy, involves the scanning (digitization) of glass slides to produce "digital slides". WSI has been advocated for diagnostic, educational and research purposes. When used for remote frozen section diagnosis, WSI requires a thorough implementation period coupled with trained support personnel. Adoption of WSI for rendering pathologic diagnoses on a routine basis has been shown to be successful in only a few "niche" applications. Wider adoption will most likely require full integration with the laboratory information system, continuous automated scanning, high-bandwidth connectivity, massive storage capacity, and more intuitive user interfaces. Nevertheless, WSI has been reported to enhance specific pathology practices, such as scanning slides received in consultation or of legal cases, of slides to be used for patient care conferences, for quality assurance purposes, to retain records of slides to be sent out or destroyed by ancillary testing, and for performing digital image analysis. In addition to technical issues, regulatory and validation requirements related to WSI have yet to be adequately addressed. Although limited validation studies have been published using WSI there are currently no standard guidelines for validating WSI for diagnostic use in the clinical laboratory. This review addresses the current status of WSI in pathology related to regulation and validation, the provision of remote and routine pathologic diagnoses, educational uses, implementation issues, and the cost-benefit analysis of adopting WSI in routine clinical practice.},

The objective is to deliver a low-cost telemedicine platform which will allow for reliable remote diagnosis m-health applications such as emergency incidents, mass population screening, and medical education purposes. The performance of the proposed system is demonstrated using five atherosclerotic plaque ultrasound videos. The videos are encoded at the clinically acquired resolution, in addition to lower, QCIF, and CIF resolutions, at different bitrates, and four different encoding structures. Commercially available wireless local area network (WLAN) and 3.5G high-speed packet access (HSPA) wireless channels are used to validate the developed platform. Objective video quality assessment is based on PSNR ratings, following calibration using the variable frame delay (VFD) algorithm that removes temporal mismatch between original and received videos. Clinical evaluation is based on atherosclerotic plaque ultrasound video assessment protocol. Experimental results show that adequate diagnostic quality wireless medical video communications are realized using the designed telemedicine platform. HSPA cellular networks provide for ultrasound video transmission at the acquired resolution, while VFD algorithm utilization bridges objective and subjective ratings.},

Outcomes were compared with a standard outpatient rehabilitation program (ORP). Then 18 TRP patients underwent 28 sessions of strength exercises (60 min) and cycle training (40 min) using a satellite platform provided telemonitoring, tele-prescription, video-assistance and phone-calls, patients were equipped with an oximeter, steps-counter, bicycle, remote control and interactive TV software. 18 matched ORP, retrospectively identified from our hospital ORP database, were used as controls. At baseline and end of program, the 6-min walking test (6MWT), Medical Research Council (MRC) scale and Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were administered. In TRP only, we assessed platform use, incremental exercise, steps walked/day and patient satisfaction. TRP patients completed all sessions without side effects, used the remote control 1,394 ± 2,329 times being in the 84\% of the cases satisfied with the service. In 22\% of the cases patients found the technology unfriendly. Each health-professional performed 46 ± 65 actions, 14.6 ± 2.12 phone calls and 1 ± 1.67 videoconference sessions per patient. TRP patients increased physical activity (3,412 vs. 1,863 steps/day, p = 0.0002). Both programs produced significant (all, p {\textless} 0.01) gains in 6MWT [meters, TRP +34.22 ± 50.79; ORP +33.61 ± 39.25], dyspnea [TRP - 0.72 ± 0.89; ORP - 0.94 ± 0.53] and SGRQ [TRP - 6.9 ± 9.96, ORP - 9.9 ± 12.92] without between-group differences. In conclusion, TRP is feasible and well accepted by patients, although sometimes technology was perceived as difficult. It seems to improve walking capacity, dyspnea, quality of life and daily physical activity. Future RCTs will demonstrate cost-effectiveness.},

An electronic blood pressure manometer, a videophone, an antihypertensive drug (amlodipine), and a customer satisfaction questionnaire were given to every group A patient. With a video-communication program linked to the Web, we monitored every 4 hours (from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.) for 2 days the surgical wound, blood pressure, and heart frequency of the patients. Other patients were included in group B. No differences regarding demographic characteristics, risk factors, carotid lesions, operative time, postoperative complications, or blood loss were noted between group A and group B. Twenty-one patients in group A were actually discharged 1 day after surgery. No cervical hematoma developed. Three hypertensive crises were treated successfully in group A. From the questionnaire a feeling of insecurity at discharge emerged, but it rapidly resolved. The overall cost of video connections was 25.39 +/- 0.25 Euros per patient.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although many medical schools incorporate distance learning into their curricula, assessing students at a distance can be challenging. While some assessments are relatively simple to administer to remote students, other assessments, such as objective structured clinical exams (OSCEs) are not. This article describes a means to more effectively and efficiently assess distance learners and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the assessment.
METHODS: We developed a teleOSCE, administered online in real time, to two cohorts of students on a rural clerkship rotation and assessed the feasibility and acceptability of using such an approach to assess medical students' clinical skills at rural locations. Project feasibility was defined as having development and implementation costs of less than \$5000. Project acceptability was determined by analyzing student interview transcripts. A qualitative case study design framework was chosen due to the novel nature of the activity.
RESULTS: The implementation cost of the teleOSCE was approximately US\$1577.20, making it a feasible educational endeavor. Interview data indicated the teleOSCE was also acceptable to students.
CONCLUSIONS: The teleOSCE format may be useful to other institutions as a method to centrally administer clinical skills exams for assessment of distance medical students.},

	abstract = {Objective To determine whether a diabetes case management telemedicine intervention reduced healthcare expenditures, as measured by Medicare claims, and to assess the costs of developing and implementing the telemedicine intervention. Design We studied 1665 participants in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel), a randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine case management of diabetes to usual care. Participants were aged 55 years or older, and resided in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. Measurements We analyzed Medicare claims payments for each participant for up to 60 study months from date of randomization, until their death, or until December 31, 2006 (whichever happened first). We also analyzed study expenditures for the telemedicine intervention over six budget years (February 28, 2000- February 27, 2006). Results Mean annual Medicare payments (SE) were similar in the usual care and telemedicine groups, \$9040 (\$386) and \$9669 (\$443) per participant, respectively (p{\textgreater}0.05). Sensitivity analyses, including stratification by censored status, adjustment by enrollment site, and semi-parametric weighting by probability of dropping-out, rendered similar results. Over six budget years 28 821 participant/months of telemedicine intervention were delivered, at an estimated cost of \$622 per participant/month. Conclusion Telemedicine case management was not associated with a reduction in Medicare claims in this medically underserved population. The cost of implementing the telemedicine intervention was high, largely representing special purpose hardware and software costs required at the time. Lower implementation costs will need to be achieved using lower cost technology in order for telemedicine case management to be more widely used.},

In a Department of Defense (DoD) setting, subjects were randomized to either a teledermatology consult or usual care. Accrued healthcare utilization recorded over a 4-month period included clinic visits, teledermatology visits, laboratories, preparations, procedures, radiological tests, and medications. Direct medical care costs were estimated by combining utilization data with Medicare reimbursement rates and wholesale drug prices. The indirect cost of productivity loss for seeking treatment was also included in the analysis using an average labor rate. Total and average costs were compared between groups. Teledermatology patients incurred \$103,043 in total direct costs (\$294 average), while usual-care patients incurred \$98,365 (\$283 average). However, teledermatology patients only incurred \$16,359 (\$47 average) in lost productivity cost while usual-care patients incurred \$30,768 (\$89 average). In total, teledermatology patients incurred \$119,402 (\$340 average) and usual-care patients incurred \$129,133 (\$372 average) in costs.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study examined the cost-effectiveness of a telemedicine-based collaborative care model designed to increase rural veterans' engagement in evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
METHODS: The Telemedicine Outreach for PTSD (TOP) study used a pragmatic randomized effectiveness trial to examine effects of PTSD care teams located at Veterans Affairs medical centers and supporting primary care providers in satellite clinics. Teams included a nurse care manager, pharmacist, psychologist, and psychiatrist. Effectiveness was estimated with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the Short Form Health Survey for Veterans and Quality of Well-Being (QWB) scale. Intervention and health care costs were collected to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.
RESULTS: The sample (N=265) included mostly rural, unemployed, middle-aged men with a military service-connected disability for PTSD randomly assigned to TOP or usual care. Only minor improvements in QWB QALYs were found. The TOP intervention was relatively expensive, with costs totaling \$2,029 per patient per year. Intervention costs were not offset by reductions in health care utilization costs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \$185,565 per QALY (interquartile range \$57,675 to \$395,743).
CONCLUSIONS: Because of the upfront training costs and the resource-intensive nature of this intervention, associated expenses were high. Although PTSD-specific effectiveness measures were significantly improved, these changes did not translate to QALYs in the main analysis. However, analyses focusing on patient subgroups with comorbid mental disorders indicated greater QALY improvement for TOP at lower cost.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of an integrated, clinician-focused telehealth monitoring system on the probability of hospitalization for home health care patients with diabetes. The study included 2009 data from 699 Medicare beneficiaries receiving home health services in Texas and Louisiana. Propensity score matching, logistic regression, and post-estimation parameter simulation were used to assess how telehealth affects the probability of hospitalization during the first 30 days of home health care. The 30-day hospitalization probability for telehealth and non-telehealth patients was 7\% and 19\%, respectively. Patients in the telehealth group had a 12 (95\% confidence interval = 4.2-20.3) percentage point-lower probability of hospitalization within the first 30 days of home health care than non-telehealth matched patients. The results suggest that telehealth monitoring systems that integrate skilled clinicians with critical care experience can lead to substantially lower hospitalization rates during the first 30 days of home health care, large cost savings, and more effective home health management of patients with diabetes.},

We examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of this intervention vs usual care in Canadians with cerebrovascular disease. A Markov decision model cost-utility analysis examining community-residing, high-risk patients with a recent nondisabling cerebrovascular event was created. A lifetime time horizon and health care payer perspective were used. Achieved BP, future cardiovascular risks, and attendant consequences on quality-adjusted life years and Canadian dollar costs were modeled. BP telemonitoring was assumed to occur for 3 months, then quarterly. Life tables were used to determine overall mortality, adjusted by cardiovascular disease mortality. Relative efficacies of intervention-associated BP lowering, resource use, and costs were obtained from Canadian published literature. Reduction in systolic BP of 9.7 mmHg was used in the base case; subsequently, robust sensitivity analyses were conducted. The results showed that, over the lifetime horizon, telemonitoring with case management led to net health care savings of \$1929 Canadian and increased per-patient QALYs by 0.83. These findings were robust to sensitivity analysis, with the intervention remaining dominant or highly cost-effective. Increasing telemonitoring costs by 50\% still resulted in the intervention being dominant; if the costs of telemonitoring plus case management were 2-3 times base case cost, incremental cost-effectiveness was \$1200-\$4700 per quality-adjusted life year gained. In conclusion, home BP telemonitoring and pharmacist case management poststroke lowered costs and improved QALYs. Strategies and funding for broad implementation of this dominant strategy should be implemented.},

Out of 163 (52.2\%) patients with symptoms during the monitoring period, 100 (61.3\%) had an arrhythmia. ILR was useful in ruling out an arrhythmic cause for symptoms in 63 (38.7\%) patients. ILR results led to pacemaker implantation in 23 patients (7.4\% overall and 11.2\% of those with syncope) after median follow-up of 3 months. A new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation was made in 38 (12.2\%) patients, 11 of whom were initiated on oral anticoagulants. ILR results led to pacemaker implantation in 31 patients (9.9\% overall and 19.0\% of those with syncope) after median follow-up of 3 months. A new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation was made in 38 (12.2\%) patients, nine of whom were initiated on oral anticoagulants. Overall, ILR led to a change in management in 47\% patients with a number needed to implant of 2.1 to change management.
CONCLUSION: ILR monitoring is effective in achieving symptom-rhythm correlation and results in changes in management in nearly half of implanted patients. Additional studies are needed to evaluate cost efficacy of ILR and the optimal monitoring duration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Primary open angle glaucoma is a chronic, progressive eye disease that is the leading cause of blindness among African Americans. Glaucoma progresses more rapidly and appears about 10 years earlier in African Americans as compared to whites. African Americans are also less likely to receive comprehensive eye care when glaucoma could be detected before irreversible blindness. Screening and follow-up protocols for managing glaucoma recommended by eye-care professional organizations are often not followed by primary eye-care providers, both ophthalmologists and optometrists. There is a pressing need to improve both the accessibility and quality of glaucoma care for African Americans. Telemedicine may be an effective solution for improving management and diagnosis of glaucoma because it depends on ocular imaging and tests that can be electronically transmitted to remote reading centers where tertiary care specialists can examine the results. We describe the Eye Care Quality and Accessibility Improvement in the Community project (EQUALITY), set to evaluate a teleglaucoma program deployed in retail-based primary eye care practices serving communities with a large percentage of African Americans.
METHODS/DESIGN: We conducted an observational, 1-year prospective study based in two Walmart Vision Centers in Alabama staffed by primary care optometrists. EQUALITY focuses on new or existing adult patients who are at-risk for glaucoma or already diagnosed with glaucoma. Patients receive dilated comprehensive examinations and diagnostic testing for glaucoma, followed by the optometrist's diagnosis and a preliminary management plan. Results are transmitted to a glaucoma reading center where ophthalmologists who completed fellowship training in glaucoma review results and provide feedback to the optometrist, who manages the care of the patient. Patients also receive eye health education about glaucoma and comprehensive eye care. Research questions include diagnostic and management agreement between providers, the impact of eye health education on patients' knowledge and adherence to follow-up and medication, patient satisfaction, program cost-effectiveness, and EQUALITY's impact on Walmart pharmacy prescription rates.
DISCUSSION: As eye-care delivery systems in the US strive to improve quality while reducing costs, telemedicine programs including teleglaucoma initiatives such as EQUALITY could contribute toward reaching this goal, particularly among underserved populations at-risk for chronic blinding diseases.},

Most telegenetics reports describe applications in large geographical areas, showing positive patients' and professionals' satisfaction. One economic analysis published thus far reported lower costs than in-person care. We hypothesized that telegenetics can also be beneficial from the professional's view in relatively small geographical areas. We performed a pilot study in the Northern Netherlands of 51 home-based online counseling sessions for cardiogenetic and oncogenetic cascade screening, and urgent prenatal counseling. Previously, we showed patient satisfaction, anxiety, and perceived control of online counseling to be comparable to in-person counseling. This study focuses on expectations, satisfaction, and practical evaluations of the involved counselors, and the impact in terms of time and costs. Most counselors expected disadvantages of online counseling for themselves and their patients, mainly concerning insufficient non-verbal communication; few expected advantages for themselves. Afterwards, counselors additionally raised the disadvantage of insufficient verbal communication, and reported frequent technical problems. Their overall mean telemedicine satisfaction itemscore was 3.38 before, and 2.95 afterwards, being afterwards slightly below the minimum level we set for a satisfactory result. We estimated reduced time and costs by online counseling with about 8\% and 10-12\%, respectively. We showed online genetic counseling to be effective, feasible and cost-efficient, but technical improvements are needed to increase counselors' satisfaction.},

Evaluations can be time consuming, patients must often travel to metropolitan areas or different cities to see experts, and misdiagnosis can result in improper treatment. To date, only a handful of assistive or remote methods exist to help physicians evaluate patients with suspected neurological disease in a convenient and consistent way. In this paper, we present a low-cost VR interface designed to support evaluation and diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease and test its use in a clinical setting. Using a commercially available VR display with an infrared camera integrated into the lens, we have constructed a 3D virtual environment designed to emulate common tasks used to evaluate patients, such as fixating on a point, conducting smooth pursuit of an object, or executing saccades. These virtual tasks are designed to elicit eye movements commonly associated with neurodegenerative disease, such as abnormal saccades, square wave jerks, and ocular tremor. Next, we conducted experiments with 9 patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and 7 healthy controls to test the system's potential to emulate tasks for clinical diagnosis. We then applied eye tracking algorithms and image enhancement to the eye recordings taken during the experiment and conducted a short follow-up study with two physicians for evaluation. Results showed that our VR interface was able to elicit five common types of movements usable for evaluation, physicians were able to confirm three out of four abnormalities, and visualizations were rated as potentially useful for diagnosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemonitoring of symptoms and physiological signs has been suggested as a means of early detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, with a view to instituting timely treatment. However, algorithms to identify exacerbations result in frequent false-positive results and increased workload. Machine learning, when applied to predictive modelling, can determine patterns of risk factors useful for improving prediction quality.
OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to (1) establish whether machine learning techniques applied to telemonitoring datasets improve prediction of hospital admissions and decisions to start corticosteroids, and (2) determine whether the addition of weather data further improves such predictions.
METHODS: We used daily symptoms, physiological measures, and medication data, with baseline demography, COPD severity, quality of life, and hospital admissions from a pilot and large randomized controlled trial of telemonitoring in COPD. We linked weather data from the United Kingdom meteorological service. We used feature selection and extraction techniques for time series to construct up to 153 predictive patterns (features) from symptom, medication, and physiological measurements. We used the resulting variables to construct predictive models fitted to training sets of patients and compared them with common symptom-counting algorithms.
RESULTS: We had a mean 363 days of telemonitoring data from 135 patients. The two most practical traditional score-counting algorithms, restricted to cases with complete data, resulted in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) estimates of 0.60 (95\% CI 0.51-0.69) and 0.58 (95\% CI 0.50-0.67) for predicting admissions based on a single day's readings. However, in a real-world scenario allowing for missing data, with greater numbers of patient daily data and hospitalizations (N=57,150, N+=55, respectively), the performance of all the traditional algorithms fell, including those based on 2 days' data. One of the most frequently used algorithms performed no better than chance. All considered machine learning models demonstrated significant improvements; the best machine learning algorithm based on 57,150 episodes resulted in an aggregated AUC of 0.74 (95\% CI 0.67-0.80). Adding weather data measurements did not improve the predictive performance of the best model (AUC 0.74, 95\% CI 0.69-0.79). To achieve an 80\% true-positive rate (sensitivity), the traditional algorithms were associated with an 80\% false-positive rate: our algorithm halved this rate to approximately 40\% (specificity approximately 60\%). The machine learning algorithm was moderately superior to the best symptom-counting algorithm (AUC 0.77, 95\% CI 0.74-0.79 vs AUC 0.66, 95\% CI 0.63-0.68) at predicting the need for corticosteroids.
CONCLUSIONS: Early detection and management of COPD remains an important goal given its huge personal and economic costs. Machine learning approaches, which can be tailored to an individual's baseline profile and can learn from experience of the individual patient, are superior to existing predictive algorithms and show promise in achieving this goal.

	issn = {0926-9630},
	abstract = {Although wound care has been practiced for centuries, telewound care is a relatively new concept. Currently, only a few pilot programs are in existence. Telewound care has yet to achieve the popularity and recognition of its other telemedicine predecessors amongst members of the health care industry and public alike. The tremendous potential of incorporating the technology of telemedicine into wound care needs to be realized. Wound care is a representation of the care of chronic and debilitating conditions that require long-term specialized care. We have seen the positive effects of improved living conditions and advances in health care globally. The result: people are now living longer. Every day a small piece is added to the pie: the percentage of world's elderly and those with chronic medical conditions that would require medical attention is rising. With the escalating costs of health care, and the push of the industry towards outpatient care, this is a part of the health care crisis that is demanding our immediate attention. We have seen positive outcomes in the care of other chronic medial conditions using telemedicine such as home telecare programs. In addition, the effectiveness of several programs using available advances in technology such as the field of radiology has been established. Wound care can build on success created in these fields to create an effective and useful method of care. The aim of this chapter is to recognize the impact of this problem, to introduce several pilot programs in several different aspects of wound care and to build on current resources in order to achieve a novel method of wound care. The goal would be to create a technologically advanced, cost-effective and user-friendly program, and be able to bridge the gap between the sick and available specialized care. Both store-and-forward technology and televideo have a role to play in telewound care, the latter greater in the role of home telecare and teleconsultation, and the former in post-operative patients and the follow-up of chronic wounds. Either way, both have been underutilized and underdeveloped. With the advances in the field of telecommunications in connecting people across distances at a fraction of the time and costs, improved outcomes reported in other fields of telemedicine and positive legislative changes, there is an enormous potential in this field. We now have the ability, knowledge and resources to develop telewound care programs, which can provide high quality patient care in a more concise and cost-effective way. It is certainly a welcoming relief to a field that has traditionally been known to pose an emotional, physical and financial drain to all those involved.},

	abstract = {With the increase in the number of people having a chronic disease, there is an increase in households having more than a single person suffering from the same chronic illness. One problem of monitoring such patients in their own home is that current devices have a limitation in the number of people who can use a single device. This study investigates the use of Near Field Communication (NFC) for identification in a multi-user environment.
METHODS: A mixed-method qualitative and quantitative approach was adopted, including focus groups, observations and a field trial. Data were collected in three phases. In Phase 1, five focus groups were conducted with patients to determine their beliefs, concerns and issues with using identification in remote patient monitoring devices. In Phase 2, participants were given a blood pressure monitor modified to include an NFC reader to enable identification. The modified device was given to patients living as a couple in the same household and both suffering from hypertension. Both patients used the device for a period of two weeks to observe their acceptance of the technology and determine their experience of usage. A total of 40 (20 couples) patients participated in the trial. Non-adherence to the full monitoring regimen was low and was mainly due to usability issues or commitments taking them away from the home and thus unable to take readings. After the trial period participants were invited to discuss their experiences with the technology in a focus group discussion (Phase 3), a total of five focus groups were conducted. Focus group discussions with the patients revealed that most participants liked using the system and were not apprehensive towards Healthcare Information Technology (HIT). The participants also had suggestions for improvements that could be made to the modified blood pressure monitor (such as, rechargeable in place batteries, integrate the components, easier to use cuff, and increased sensitivity of the NFC reader) that might improve the overall experience of the proposed technology and its acceptance.
CONCLUSION: The study proposes a new framework, the Senior Patient Technology Acceptance Model (SPTAM) that offers an understanding of the needs of the elderly towards technology use and the factors that influence its acceptance. SPTAM emphasises that involving the patient in the early stages of development can lead to a more user-centred technology and help in identifying any underlying issues at an early stage, thus avoiding adding features which patients do not need. The findings from this empirical research can be used as recommendations to improve current RPM devices, save the NHS costs, inform standardization groups.},

METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for publications in English. The benefit and relative risk (RR) were estimated applying a random-effect model.
RESULTS: Twenty-three randomized controlled trials with a high level of heterogeneity were selected (7037 patients). Compared to usual care, HBPT improved office SBP by 4.71 mmHg [95\% confidence interval (CI): 6.18, 3.24; P {\textless} 0.001] and DBP by 2.45 mmHg (3.33, 1.57; P {\textless} 0.001). A larger proportion of patients achieved office BP normalization ({\textless}140/90 mmHg nondiabetic patients and {\textless}130/80 mmHg diabetic patients) in the intervention group [RR: 1.16 (1.04, 1.29); P {\textless} 0.001]. HBPT led to a significantly larger prescription of antihypertensive medications [+0.40 (+0.17,+0.62), P {\textless} 0.001], but to therapeutic adherence and rate of office consultations similar to usual care. Healthcare costs were significantly (P {\textless} 0.001) larger in the HBPT group [+662.92 (+540.81, +785.04) euros per patient], but were similar to those of the usual care when only medical costs were considered [-12.4 (-930.52, +906.23) euros; P = 0.767]. Use of HBPT helped improving the physical component of quality of life [SF-12 or SF-36 questionnaire: +2.78 (+1.15, +4.41) P {\textless} 0.001]. No difference was observed in the risk of adverse events [RR: 1.22 (0.86, 1.71); P = 0.111].

	abstract = {Alentejo covers a third of Portugal, yet it is home to only 5\% of the population. Residents of the region are poorer, older, and less educated than the rest of the country. There is a shortage of physicians in several specialties. The low population density, a concentration of specialized services, and a poor public transportation network all create barriers to access. Telemedicine was introduced in 1998 to help address these challenges. In this article, we provide an overview of the program and its current status, focusing on infrastructure, services, and activity volume. We also discuss the impact the program has had from the perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals. From 1998 to 2011, there were 132,546 episodes of service using telemedicine, including real-time teleconsultations, teleradiology, teleultrasound, and telepathology. At present, the network includes 20 primary care units and five hospitals, covering almost 30,000 km(2) and 500,000 people. Units have high-resolution videoconferencing equipment, access to patients' clinical records, an image archive, and peripherals, such as electronic dermatoscopes and phonendoscopes. Teleconsultations are available in 15 medical specialties and areas, ranging from neurology to pediatric surgery. In 2008, regional health authorities started a tele-education program, and by the end of 2011, 876 healthcare professionals, across 52 locations, had participated in remote learning sessions. More than a decade since telemedicine was introduced in Alentejo, it is now an integral part of everyday service provision. A comprehensive assessment of the costs and consequences of the program is currently underway.},

In this study, we explored the connection between eConsults and the Quadruple Aim using a unique national dataset of PCC-reported eConsult outcomes. Methods We conducted a retrospective study analysing registry data from the RubiconMD electronic consultation platform used by PCCs in 34 US states. We analysed PCC-reported outcomes from eConsults that took place between March 2017 and January 2018. PCCs were asked to select one or more of the following options after each eConsult: improved care plan, educational, avoided unnecessary diagnostics/procedures, avoided referral altogether or to wrong specialty, or no effect. Results PCCs reported an outcome for 3872 eConsults. eConsults for dermatology, endocrinology, and haematology-oncology were most common. Over one in four PCCs reported that the eConsult avoided a referral altogether or to the wrong specialty (26.3\%) and avoided unnecessary diagnostics/procedures (26.1\%). In 75\% of eConsults, PCCs reported an improved care plan. Fifty percent reported that the eConsult was educational. Discussion PCCs in diverse practice settings reported substantial benefits from eConsults. In over half of eConsults, PCCs reported that the eConsult avoided unnecessary diagnostics/procedures, avoided a referral altogether or avoided a referral to the wrong specialty. Findings suggest that eConsults demonstrate important educational benefits, but may also influence PCC decision-making in a way that yields tremendous cost-saving potential and improved patient experience.},

INTRODUCTION: Although teledermatology has been suggested as an effective way of reducing costs and providing otherwise inaccessible expert evaluation, most studies have relied on high cost and high technological means.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a study with inpatients that required dermatological evaluation in a high-complexity university hospital, accessing the correlation between traditional face-to-face evaluation and SF teledermatology, with data and pictures collected by medical students using smartphone cameras and then sent to consultants by e-mail.
RESULTS: For 2 months, we evaluated 100 patients and, as a result, the total agreement between both consultation modalities was 54\%, the partial agreement was 27\%, and the disagreement was 19\%.
DISCUSSION: This study points out that SF teledermatology with the use of mobile phone is comparable to traditional face-to-face evaluation. Furthermore, most of the disagreements were probably related to the inexperience of the medical residents.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that a smartphone-based teledermatology inpatient consultation model could be a reasonable option for hospitals lacking dermatological services. Also, it may be as or more effective than face-to-face consultations, if performed by a more experienced dermatologist. When feasible, photographing training should be performed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the efforts of the healthcare community to improve the quality of diabetes care, about 50\% of people with type 2 diabetes do not reach their treatment targets, increasing the risk of future micro-and macro-vascular complications. Diabetes self-management education has been shown to contribute to better disease control. However, it is not known which strategies involving educational programs are cost-effective. Telehealth applications might support chronic disease management. Transferability of successful distant patient self-management support programs to the Belgian setting needs to be confirmed by studies of a high methodological quality. "The COACH Program" was developed in Australia as target driven educational telephone delivered intervention to support people with different chronic conditions. It proved to be effective in patients with coronary heart disease after hospitalization. Clinical and cost-effectiveness of The COACH Program in people with type 2 diabetes in Belgium needs to be assessed.
METHODS/DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients were selected based on their medication consumption data and were recruited by their sickness fund. They were randomized to receive either usual care plus "The COACH Program" or usual care alone. The study will assess the difference in outcomes between groups. The primary outcome measure is the level of HbA1c. The secondary outcomes are: Total Cholesterol, LDL-Cholesterol, HDL-Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Blood Pressure, body mass index, smoking status; proportion of people at target for HbA1c, LDL-Cholesterol and Blood Pressure; self-perceived health status, diabetes-specific emotional distress and satisfaction with diabetes care. The follow-up period is 18 months. Within-trial and modeled cost-utility analyses, to project effects over life-time horizon beyond the trial duration, will be undertaken from the perspective of the health care system if the intervention is effective.
DISCUSSION: The study will enhance our understanding of the potential of telehealth in diabetes management in Belgium. Research on the clinical effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness is essential to support policy makers in future reimbursement and implementation decisions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing cost and inequitable access to quality healthcare, coupled with the merger of the information technology and health service sectors, has given rise to the modern field of telemedicine. Telemedicine, meaning medicine at a distance, allows us to transcend geographic and socioeconomic boundaries to deliver high quality care to remote and/or in-need patients. As technology becomes more affordable and a physician shortage looms, telemedicine is gaining attention as a possible solution to healthcare delivery. Simultaneously, telemedicine holds great promise with regard to medical education. Several studies integrating telemedicine in medical education have shown positive outcomes, demonstrating similar or greater efficacy compared with traditional educational methods with high student-reported enthusiasm. Other domestic and international telemedicine projects, largely spearheaded by universities, have also achieved great success.
DISCUSSION: In a novel approach, by pairing medical schools with in-need partner communities, utilizing similar faculty resources as traditional learning methods with standardized patients, students can gain valuable experience and skills while serving actual patients. This progressive approach to medical education fosters collaboration, communication, longitudinal care and teaches students needed skills for their future practices as 21 st Century healthcare providers.},

This article reports a retrospective cohort study conducted at the NHS Birmingham East and North.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Adults with at least 1 of 10 defined long-term conditions were eligible for inclusion. Patients in the OwnHealth program were compared with those in a matched comparison group from a population who were eligible but did not enroll in the program. The main outcome measures were the difference in the number of secondary care spells (defined as the experience between hospital admission and discharge) between the OwnHealth group and the comparison group and the difference in the cost of care (calculated from the cost of activities during secondary care spells).
RESULTS: The mean number of secondary care spells per person per year in the OwnHealth group was 0.61 (standard deviation [SD] 1.35) compared with 0.84 (SD 1.49) in the comparison group (p{\textless}0.0005). This constituted a 27\% reduction in secondary care spells per person per year. The mean cost of secondary care spells per person per year in the OwnHealth group was \$1,305 (SD \$3,138) compared with \$1,678 (SD \$3,485) in the comparison group (p{\textless}0.0005).
DISCUSSION: This difference in costs constituted a 27\% reduction in utilization and 22\% reduction in cost of secondary care with the OwnHealth program.
CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth intervention can reduce the cost of secondary care of some patients with long-term conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home telemonitoring (HTM) is a promising approach to improve quality of life (QoL) and decrease hospital utilization.
METHODS: This randomized-controlled study followed 89 community-dwelling Medicare outpatients with heart failure (HF) after discharge from home care for 6 months. Patients were randomized to HTM or comprehensive outpatient management (COM). HTM received weekly (video) televisits with daily vital sign monitoring. COM was contacted weekly by telephone. Outcomes included emergency department (ED) and inpatient utilization and QoL.
RESULTS: Average age at enrollment was 81.4 for HTM and 84.9 for COM. Thirty-eight percent of HTM had ≥1 ED visit versus 60\% of COM (p = 0.04), while 48\% of HTM had ≥1 hospitalization versus 55\% of COM (p = 0.47). Length of stay (LOS) (days) was 4.0 for HTM versus 7.4 for COM (p = 0.39). Costs were \$38,990 for HTM versus \$50,943 for COM (p = 0.91). QoL improved by -9.66 for HTM and -3.56 for COM (p = 0.02). Although HF-related utilization did not differ between groups, HTM patients who were highly adherent obtained better all-cause outcomes than those with low adherence.
CONCLUSIONS: Significantly improved all-cause ED utilization, LOS, and QoL were found for HTM; other differences were not significant. More research is needed to determine how to best utilize this technology to improve patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an emerging threat to the health of populations in Africa. With the inadequate health infrastructures, understaffed and underfunded health systems, African countries are ill-prepared to cope with the increasing demand for care for CVD, particularly for populations in remote and underserved rural areas, where 60\% of the population currently reside. Task shifting and telehealth have been suggested as strategies to overcome the current health workforce shortage in African countries, and to increase access to prevention and curative services for emerging CVD. However, strategies for promoting their incorporation into the existing health systems, have yet to be developed. The Cardio Pad(®) initiative (originating from Cameroon) seeks to provide appropriate solutions to improve the application of telemedicine for CVD prevention and control in remote African settings. The Cardio Pad(®) is a tele-cardiology device which provides a number of advantages in terms of cost, ease of use, autonomy and reduced technology requirements. It is a fully touch screen medical device which enables cardiac tests such as electrocardiograms (ECG) to be performed in remote underserved areas (rural areas for instance), while the test results are transferred wirelessly via mobile phone connection, to specialist physicians who can interpret them and provide assistance with case management. While most of the current telemedicine clinical services on the African continent receive most expertise from developed countries, the Cardio Pad(®), a local invention by a 26-year-old Cameroon-trained engineer demonstrates how much innovative solutions to combat CVD and other health issues could and should be developed locally in Africa.},

METHODS: Six practices varying in size, care team composition and location agreed to participate. At each site we conducted unstructured interviews with key informants and directly observed practices and procedures in the field and back office.
RESULTS: The aggregated case studies revealed important issues focused on team composition, patient characteristics, use of technology and urgent care delivery. Common challenges across the practices included provider retention and unmet community demand for home-based care services. Most practices, regardless of size, faced challenges around using electronic medical records (EMRs) and scheduling systems not designed for use in a mobile practice. Although many practices offered urgent care, practices varied in the methods used to provide care including the use of community paramedics and telehealth technology.
CONCLUSIONS: Learnings compiled from these observations can inform other HBPC practices as to potential best practices that can be implemented in an effort to improve efficiency and scalability of HBPC so that seniors with multiple chronic conditions can receive comprehensive primary care services in their homes.},

New remote monitoring technologies are expected to lower these costs by reducing the number of close encounters with health care professionals, for example the number of visits to health care centres. In this paper, I discuss issues of priority setting raised by this expectation. As a starting-point, I analyse the recent debate on principles for priority setting in Sweden. The Swedish debate illustrates that developing an approach to priority setting is an ongoing process. On the basis of this analysis, I conclude that several different ethical principles, and specifications of these principles, can be appealed to for giving priority--over close encounters--to a large-scale introduction of remote monitoring technologies in health care services to elderly people, but also that many specifications can be appealed to against giving such priority. I propose that given the different views on principles, it is necessary to develop fair procedures of deliberation on these principles and their application, in particular in order to reach agreement on exactly how much resources should be allocated to remote monitoring and how much to close encounters. I also present a few points to consider in a large-scale introduction of remote monitoring.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Claims data raises the possibility that on demand telemedicine programs might increase new utilization, offsetting the cost benefits described in some retrospective analyses. We prospectively evaluated the cost of a synchronous audio-video on-demand telemedicine taking into account both what patients would have done instead of the telemedicine visit as well as the care patients received after the visit.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of patients who received care from an on-demand telemedicine program. At the time of the visit, we surveyed patients about the alternative care that would have been requested, if they had not done the telemedicine visit. We also obtained information following the visit about what further care was received. Using cost data derived from the literature we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the cost impact of the on-demand telemedicine visit.
RESULTS: There were 650 patients enrolled with a mean age of 37 who were 68\% female; 74\% had their care concerns resolved on the telemedicine visit; only 16\% would have "done nothing" if they had not done the telemedicine visit, representing possible new utilization. Net cost savings per telemedicine visit was calculated to range from \$19-\$121 per visit.
CONCLUSIONS: In our on-demand telemedicine program, we found the majority of health concerns could be resolved in a single consultation and new utilization was infrequent. Synchronous audio-video telemedicine consults resulted in short-term cost savings by diverting patients from more expensive care settings.},

OBJECTIVE: The intent was to conduct a study of a preventive medical service in a developing country, combining eHealth checkups and teleconsultation as well as assess stratification rules and the short-term effects of intervention.
METHODS: We developed an eHealth system that comprises a set of sensor devices in an attaché case, a data transmission system linked to a mobile network, and a data management application. We provided eHealth checkups for the populations of five villages and the employees of five factories/offices in Bangladesh. Individual health condition was automatically categorized into four grades based on international diagnostic standards: green (healthy), yellow (caution), orange (affected), and red (emergent). We provided teleconsultation for orange- and red-grade subjects and we provided teleprescription for these subjects as required.
RESULTS: The first checkup was provided to 16,741 subjects. After one year, 2361 subjects participated in the second checkup and the systolic blood pressure of these subjects was significantly decreased from an average of 121 mmHg to an average of 116 mmHg (P{\textless}.001). Based on these results, we propose a cost-effective method using a machine learning technique (random forest method) using the medical interview, subject profiles, and checkup results as predictor to avoid costly measurements of blood sugar, to ensure sustainability of the program in developing countries.

This pilot study was performed to investigate the safety, feasibility, and financial implications of providing postoperative care using an electronic clinic (eClinic) at a university hospital.
METHODS: An easy-to-use and secure eClinic platform was constructed in Epic (Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, WA). Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hernia repairs on an adult acute care surgery service were enrolled in this program over an 11-month period (March 2017 to January 2018). Patients with prolonged hospitalizations (greater than 4 nights), perioperative complications, drains, and open wounds were excluded. Demographics, clinical outcomes, encounter time, patient satisfaction survey results, and cost analysis were compared with the traditional clinic (tClinic) patient population.
RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-three eligible patients (61\% female; mean age 41 ± 16 years) were enrolled in this program. Their demographics were no different than the tClinic. Frequencies of readmission, reoperation, and emergency department visits (2.7\%, 0\%, and 4.2\%, respectively) in the eClinic group were also similar to the tClinic group. However, total visit time was significantly shorter in the eClinic group (14 vs 145 minutes, P {\textless} 0.01). Anonymous surveys demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction, with 85\% of patients expressing desire to utilize the eClinic again. This program enhanced the capacity for new visits to tClinic, with a resultant projected increase in additional operative cases and revenue for the health care system.
CONCLUSIONS: A safe and efficient postoperative telemedicine program can be constructed utilizing a widely available electronic medical record system, which can improve patient satisfaction, optimize throughput, and increase gross charges for the healthcare system.},

BACKGROUND: Almost 24 years ago a major earthquake devastated the northwestern region of Soviet Armenia. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration deployed a telemedicine spacebridge, which operated uninterrupted for 3 months, extending its services to the remote region of Ufa to help the burn victims, mostly children, from a railroad explosion accident. Expert consultations were provided by four major medical center from the United States and several military and civilian medical services of the Soviet Union.
LESSONS LEARNED: Disasters continue to contribute to increased morbidity and mortality with significant economic impacts worldwide. Psychological, physical, and social sequelae persist years after the events. Many pre-existing socioeconomic conditions are aggravated following disasters. Telemedicine is a useful medical and public health technology that continues to be underutilized due to the lack of inclusion in the preparedness planning, training, availability of networks, and connectivity costs.
POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Natural and human-made disasters require both near-term and long-term interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality among the surviving victims. Telemedicine, information technology, and modern portable communication devices should be incorporated in disaster preparedness and recovery training and operations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The delivery of mobile health (mHealth) services is acceptable to mental health consumers. However, despite the benefits of accessibility, cost-effectiveness, anonymity, and ability to tailor content to individual needs, consumer engagement remains a hurdle for uptake and continued use. This may be unsurprising as few studies have examined app content from the consumer perspective or assessed consumer preferences for the content of apps for mental health management. An opportunity to examine consumer perspectives exists in using naturally generated data that is publically available in the Google Play and Apple app stores. Whereas commercial developers routinely use this data, to date there has been no in-depth evaluation within scientific research.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to explore what consumers consider useful content for mental health management apps, identify unmet needs, and understand user expectations of mental health apps within the context of apps for bipolar disorder.
METHODS: Publically available English language consumer reviews of 48 apps for bipolar disorder were used as data, providing a total of 2173 reviews. Review text was coded and analyzed using a team approach to qualitative content analysis. Results were presented in 2 forms: (1) a quantitative summary of the 9 major and minor themes and (2) a qualitative synthesis of key thematic findings.
RESULTS: The majority of reviews were for symptom monitoring apps (87.94\%, 1911/2173). The qualitative content analysis revealed 5 main themes: (1) laudatory talk, comments regarding the app's benefits including helpfulness and successful design features (74.00\% of reviews, 1608/2173); (2) unfavorable feedback, negative reviews largely concerning unmet needs, privacy and technical issues, and potential dangers of app use (25.54\%, 555/2173); (3) conceptions of community, referring to both communities of users with mental ill-health accessed via the app and a community created among app users and developers (24.25\%, 527/2173); (4) wishlist features, app features requested by users (17.53\%, 381/2173); and (5) apps and therapy, app use within clinical care (10.58\%, 230/2173). Four minor themes were also identified: (1) app cost, (2) privacy and data security, (3) comparisons with traditional monitoring, and (4) evidence-based mHealth.
CONCLUSIONS: Although mostly positive, the proportion of reviews containing wishlist requests indicates consumer needs are not adequately addressed by currently available disorder management apps. Consumers value content that is helpful, supportive, and easy to use, and they are integrating apps into their health management and clinical care without necessarily considering the evidence-base or clinical effectiveness of the tool. User expectations regarding developer responsiveness to their needs has implications for community-based participatory research and integrated knowledge translation. However, this expectation is incompatible with current mHealth funding structures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide even though successful treatments exist. Improving screening and treatment could avoid many cases of vision loss. However, due to an increasing prevalence of diabetes, traditional in-person screening for DR for every diabetic patient is not feasible. Telemedicine is one viable solution to provide high-quality and efficient screening to large number of diabetic patients.
PURPOSE: To provide a narrative review of large DR telemedicine screening programs.
METHODS: Articles were identified through a comprehensive search of the English-language literature published between 2000 and 2014. Telemedicine screening programs were included for review if they had published data on at least 150 patients and had available validation studies supporting their model. Screening programs were then categorized according to their American Telemedicine Association Validation Level.
RESULTS: Seven programs from the US and abroad were identified and included in the review. Three programs were Category 1 programs (Ophdiat, EyePacs, and Digiscope), two were Category 2 programs (Eye Check, NHS Diabetic Eye Screening Program), and two were Category 3 programs (Joslin Vision Network, Alberta Screening Program). No program was identified that claimed category 4 status. Programs ranged from community or city level programs to large nationwide programs including millions of individuals. The programs demonstrated a high level of clinical accuracy in screening for DR. There was no consensus amongst the programs regarding the need for dilation, need for stereoscopic images, or the level of training for approved image graders.
CONCLUSION: Telemedicine programs have been clinically validated and successfully implemented across the globe. They can provide a high-level of clinical accuracy for screening for DR while improving patient access in a cost-effective and scalable manner.},

	volume = {17},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.3844},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation provided through home visits is part of the continuum of care after discharge from hospital following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). As demands for rehabilitation at home are growing and becoming more difficult to meet, in-home telerehabilitation has been proposed as an alternate service delivery method. However, there is a need for robust data concerning both the effectiveness and the cost of dispensing in-home telerehabilitation.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to document, analyze, and compare real costs of two service delivery methods: in-home telerehabilitation and conventional home visits.
METHODS: The economic analysis was conducted as part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) on telerehabilitation for TKA, and involved data from 197 patients, post-TKA. Twice a week for 8 weeks, participants received supervised physiotherapy via two delivery methods, depending on their study group allocation: in-home telerehabilitation (TELE) and home-visit rehabilitation (VISIT). Patients were recruited from eight hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada. The TELE group intervention was delivered by videoconferencing over high-speed Internet. The VISIT group received the same intervention at home. Costs related to the delivery of the two services (TELE and VISIT) were calculated. Student's t tests were used to compare costs per treatment between the two groups. To take distance into account, the two treatment groups were compared within distance strata using two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs).
RESULTS: The mean cost of a single session was Can \$93.08 for the VISIT group (SD \$35.70) and \$80.99 for the TELE group (SD \$26.60). When comparing both groups, real total cost analysis showed a cost differential in favor of the TELE group (TELE minus VISIT: -\$263, 95\% CI -\$382 to -\$143). However, when the patient's home was located less than 30 km round-trip from the health care center, the difference in costs between TELE and VISIT treatments was not significant (P=.25, .26, and .11 for the {\textless}10, 10-19, and 20-29 km strata, respectively). The cost of TELE treatments was lower than VISIT treatments when the distance was 30 km or more (30-49 km: \$81{\textless}\$103, P=.002; ≥50 km: \$90{\textless}\$152, P{\textless}.001).
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study of the actual costs of in-home telerehabilitation covering all subcosts of telerehabilitation and distance between the health care center and the patient's home. The cost for a single session of in-home telerehabilitation compared to conventional home-visit rehabilitation was lower or about the same, depending on the distance between the patient's home and health care center. Under the controlled conditions of an RCT, a favorable cost differential was observed when the patient was more than 30 km from the provider. Stakeholders and program planners can use these data to guide decisions regarding introducing telerehabilitation as a new service in their clinic.

On the basis of commercially available components, a custom-made wearable device is presented, which allows optical wireless transmission of accelerometer data in the context of physical activity supervision of post-stroke patients in hospital. Considering patient mobility, the experimental performance is established in terms of packet loss as a function of the number of receivers fixed to the ceiling. The results permit to conclude that optical wireless links can be used to perform such mobile remote monitoring applications. Moreover, based on the measurements obtained with one receiver, it is possible to theoretically determine the performance according to the number of receivers to be deployed.},

METHODS: Using an online survey in spring 2017, we measured students' depression, anxiety, stress, and suicidal thoughts, preferences for care options during distress, and use and interest in anonymous chats with trained nonprofessionals, online therapy, and self-help resources.
RESULTS: Overall, 10.1-13.8\% had experience with these TMH resources; however, 24.6-40.1\% expressed willingness to try them. At-risk students, especially those higher in depression/anxiety scores, showed greater use of and willingness to use some applications.
CONCLUSIONS: Counseling centers might consider endorsing TMH resources as potential pathways to care. TMH resources might help broaden reach with minimal cost, reduce mental health help-seeking barriers, and provide support to at-risk populations.},

We sought to better understand if immediate response technology (IRT) could be used to gather mental health care data and educate youth on telemental health (TMH) resources.
Methods: Using an IRT imbedded within an interactive, media-rich school-based presentation, we gathered mental health history and preferences for TMH resources from 2,789 adolescents with a wide range of demographic and psychological characteristics.
Results: More than 80 percent of adolescents satisfied inclusion criteria for survey completion, and responses were statistically comparable across four diverse high school settings. Using Chi-squared analyses, we found that less than 10 percent of adolescents, especially girls and those with high depression/anxiety scores, had previously used TMH resources. After interacting with the IRT, many more (29 percent to 43 percent) expressed willingness to use these resources.
Discussion: The IRT system was effective in gathering mental electronic health data, delivering targeted mental health education, and promoting positive attitudes towards TMH among adolescents.
Conclusions: IRTs and other non-formalized technologies should be explored as cost-effective, easy-to-implement resources for electronic health data gathering and health care education.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate operational policies that may improve the proportion of eligible stroke patients within a population who would receive intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and minimize time to treatment in eligible patients.
METHODS: In the context of a regional stroke team, the authors examined the effects of staff location and telemedicine deployment policies on the timeliness of thrombolytic treatment, and estimated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of six different policies. A process map comprising the steps from recognition of stroke symptoms to intravenous administration of rt-PA was constructed using data from published literature combined with expert opinion. Six scenarios were investigated: telemedicine deployment (none, all, or outer-ring hospitals only) and staff location (center of region or anywhere in region). Physician locations were randomly generated based on their zip codes of residence and work. The outcomes of interest were onset-to-treatment (OTT) time, door-to-needle (DTN) time, and the proportion of patients treated within 3 hours. A Monte Carlo simulation of the stroke team care-delivery system was constructed based on a primary data set of 121 ischemic stroke patients who were potentially eligible for treatment with rt-PA.
RESULTS: With the physician located randomly in the region, deploying telemedicine at all hospitals in the region (compared with partial or no telemedicine) would result in the highest rates of treatment within 3 hours (80\% vs. 75\% vs. 70\%) and the shortest OTT (148 vs. 164 vs. 176 minutes) and DTN (45 vs. 61 vs. 73 minutes) times. However, locating the on-call physician centrally coupled with partial telemedicine deployment (five of the 17 hospitals) would be most cost-effective with comparable eligibility and treatment times.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the potential societal benefits, continued efforts to deploy telemedicine appear warranted. Aligning the incentives between those who would have to fund the up-front technology investments and those who will benefit over time from reduced ongoing health care expenses will be necessary to fully realize the benefits of telemedicine for stroke care.},

Patients were recruited and randomly assigned for six months to either telemonitoring or standard care. Telemonitoring transmitted vital signs and clinical alerts daily to a central nursing station. Utilization of covered services was analyzed for the six-month telemonitoring period to test for hypothesized reductions in hospital days and changes in utilization of the emergency department (ED), urgent care, and primary care. Negative binomial regressions adjusted for gender, age, co-occurring diabetes, co-occurring chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and residence neighborhood were used to analyze units of service, and two-part (hurdle) multivariable models were used for expenditures. The main finding was a tendency for lower total number of hospital days for patients assigned to telemonitoring. Results for other covered services were generally consistent with hypothesized direction and magnitude; however, statistical power was reduced because of lower-than-expected recruitment rates into the study. Within a managed-care environment, telemonitoring appears to facilitate better ambulatory management of heart failure patients, including fewer ED visits, which were offset by more frequent primary care and urgent care visits.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulse oximetry, a ubiquitous, noninvasive method to monitor oxygen saturation (SpO2), requires larger, nonportable equipment. Smartphone pulse oximeter applications (apps) provide a portable, cost-effective option, but are untested in children. We hypothesize that smartphone pulse oximetry will not be inferior to standard pulse oximetry measured in healthy children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two main types of pulse oximetry apps, a camera-based app (CBA) that uses a phone camera flash and lens and a probe-based app (PBA) that uses an external plug-in probe, were compared with standard pulse oximetry measured in children ages 2-13 years without a respiratory complaint and a triage SpO2 ≥97\% seen in a pediatric Emergency Department. Two investigators obtained heart rate and SpO2 using each app. Inter-rater reliability was tested using interclass correlations (ICCs), and Bland-Altman method was used to compare app values to triage measurements.
RESULTS: Eighty-one patients were enrolled. ICC for SpO2 for PBA and CBA were 0.73 and -0.24, respectively. The 95\% limits of agreement between the PBA SpO2 and triage SpO2 were -2.8 to +2.5 compared with -4.1 to +3.5 for the CBA SpO2 and triage SpO2. Mean differences between triage SpO2 and the PBA SpO2 (-0.17\%) and triage SpO2 and CBA SpO2 (-0.33\%) were not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-based pulse oximetry is not inferior to standard pulse oximetry in pediatric patients without hypoxia.

	abstract = {Background: Routine ambulatory echocardiographic estimates of left ventricular (LV) filling pressures are not cost-effective and are occasionally fraught with anatomic, physiologic as well as logistical limitations. The use of implantable hemodynamic devices such as CardioMEMS Heart Failure (HF) System has been shown to reduce HF-related readmission rates by remote monitoring of LV filling pressures. Little is known about the correlation between CardioMEMS and echocardiography-derived estimates of central hemodynamics.
Methods: We performed a prospective, single-center study enrolling seventeen participants with New York Heart Association functional class II-III HF and preimplanted CardioMEMS sensor. Simultaneous CardioMEMS readings and a limited echocardiogram were performed at individual clinic visits. Estimated left atrial pressure (LAP) by echocardiogram was calculated by the Nagueh formula. Linear regression was used as a measure of agreement. Variability between methods was evaluated by Bland-Altman analysis.
Results: Mean age was 74 ± 9 years; 59\% (10/17) were males. LV systolic dysfunction was present in 76\% (13/17) of subjects. Mean PAdP was 18 ± 4 mmHg and 19 ± 5 mmHg for CardioMEMS and echocardiographic-derived estimates, respectively, with a significant correlation between both methods (r2=0.798, p ≤ 0.001).
Conclusions: Our study illustrates a direct linear correlation between PAdP measured by CardioMEMS and simultaneous measurement of LV filling pressures derived by echocardiography.},

The use of RAS in gynecologic patients includes hysterectomy, myomectomy, tubal reanastomoses, radical hysterectomy, lymph node dissection, and sacrocolpopexies. Although individual studies vary, gynecological RAS is often associated with longer operating room time but similar clinical outcomes, decreased blood loss, and shorter hospital stay. RAS procedures on women have, however, their own limitations: the patented equipment is very large, bulky, and expensive, the staff must be trained specifically on draping and docking the instruments, the lack of surgical haptic feedback, a limited vaginal access, a limited specific instrumentation, and the need for larger port incisions requiring fascial closure. The RAS significantly facilitates gynecologic surgery, even if well-designed, prospective studies are needed to fully assess the value of this equipments in particular studies with well-defined clinical and long-term outcomes, including complications, cost, pain, return to normal activity, and quality of life. The future of robotic surgery in gynecology may be bright, but currently, caution is advisable and clinically meaningful long-term outcomes are needed. These recent patents, however, has exciting potential for future applications, especially in long-distance telesurgery and might change the paradigm of gynecologic surgery in the future.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated a videoconference-based psychiatric emergency consultation program (telepsychiatry) at geographically dispersed emergency department (ED) sites that are part of the network of care of an academic children's hospital system. The study compared program outcomes with those of usual care involving ambulance transport to the hospital for in-person psychiatric emergency consultation prior to disposition to inpatient care or discharge home.
METHODS: This study compared process outcomes in a cross-sectional, pre-post design at five network-of-care sites before and after systemwide implementation of telepsychiatry consultation in 2015. Clinical records on 494 pediatric psychiatric emergencies included ED length of stay, disposition/discharge, and hospital system charges. Satisfaction surveys regarding telepsychiatry consultations were completed by providers and parents or guardians.
RESULTS: Compared with children who received usual care, children who received telepsychiatry consultations had significantly shorter median ED lengths of stay (5.5 hours and 8.3 hours, respectively, p{\textless}.001) and lower total patient charges (\$3,493 and \$8,611, p{\textless}.001). Providers and patient caregivers reported high satisfaction with overall acceptability, effectiveness, and efficiency of telepsychiatry. No safety concerns were indicated based on readmissions within 72 hours in either treatment condition.
CONCLUSIONS: Measured by charges and time, telepsychiatry consultations for pediatric psychiatric emergencies were cost-efficient from a hospital system perspective compared with usual care consisting of ambulance transport for in-person consultation at a children's hospital main campus. Telepsychiatry also improved clinical and operational efficiency and patient and family experience, and it showed promise for increasing access to other specialized health care needs.},

DESIGN: Decision analysis modelling of cost-effectiveness using secondary data sources.
SETTING: Acute hospitals in the UK.
PATIENTS: Patients recently discharged (within 28 days) after a HF exacerbation.
INTERVENTIONS: Structured telephone support (STS) via human to machine (STS HM) interface, (2) STS via human to human (STS HH) contact and (3) home telemonitoring (TM), compared with (4) usual care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by each strategy compared to the next most effective alternative and the probability of each strategy being cost-effective at varying willingness to pay per QALY gained.
RESULTS: TM was the most cost-effective strategy in the scenario using these base case costs. Compared with usual care, TM had an estimated incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £11 873/QALY, whereas STS HH had an ICER of £228 035/QALY against TM. STS HM was dominated by usual care. Threshold analysis suggested that the monthly cost of TM has to be higher than £390 to have an ICER greater than £20 000/QALY against STS HH. Scenario analyses performed using higher costs of usual care, higher costs of STS HH and lower costs of TM do not substantially change the conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that TM was an optimal strategy in most scenarios, but there is considerable uncertainty in relation to clear descriptions of the interventions and robust estimation of costs.},

AIM: To assess the feasibility of TD in remote supervision and education of a general practitioner with special interest (GPwSI), to reduce FTF consultations with the consultant dermatologist, and to provide appropriate diagnosis and care. Our secondary aim was to evaluate patient satisfaction with this mode of consultation.
METHODS: A TD service in Aberdeen was set up to augment supervision of a remote rural GP training in dermatology. This service was audited over a 2-year period to assess its usefulness in the education of the remote GP.
RESULTS: Prospective data on 230 selected referrals was analysed. Store-and-forward TD provided a high level of patient satisfaction, and was effective in remote supervision and education of a GPwSI in dermatology. FTF consultations with the consultant were avoided in 69\% of consultations, and diagnostic agreement was considered high (61\%). Educational feedback was given to the GP in 66\% of consultations.
CONCLUSIONS: TD can supplement infrequent specialist dermatology service in remote areas, as in this case. We conclude that for selected patients, TD was a useful training tool for supervising the GPwSI, and ensuring clinical governance and quality assurance in clinics in a remote rural area. However, this model of care was limited by cost and the inherent limitations of TD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home telemonitoring has developed considerably over recent years in chronic diseases in order to improve communication between healthcare professionals and patients and to promote early detection of deteriorating health status. In the nephrology setting, home telemonitoring has been evaluated in home dialysis patients but data are scarce concerning chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients before and after renal replacement therapy. The eNephro study is designed to assess the cost effectiveness, clinical/biological impact, and patient perception of a home telemonitoring for CKD patients. Our purpose is to present the rationale, design and organisational aspects of this study.
METHODS: eNephro is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, comparing home telemonitoring versus usual care in three populations of CKD patients: stage 3B/4 (n = 320); stage 5D CKD on dialysis (n = 260); stage 5 T CKD treated with transplantation (n= 260). Five hospitals and three not-for-profit providers managing self-care dialysis situated in three administrative regions in France are participating. The trial began in December 2015, with a scheduled 12-month inclusion period and 12 months follow-up. Outcomes include clinical and biological data (e.g. blood pressure, haemoglobin) collected from patient records, perceived health status (e.g. health related quality of life) collected from self-administered questionnaires, and health expenditure data retrieved from the French health insurance database (SNIIRAM) using a probabilistic matching procedure.
DISCUSSION: The hypothesis is that home telemonitoring enables better control of clinical and biological parameters as well as improved perceived health status. This better control should limit emergency consultations and hospitalisations leading to decreased healthcare expenditure, compensating for the financial investment due to the telemedicine system.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Internet-based applications are providing new ways of promoting health and reducing the cost of care. Although data can be kept encrypted in servers, the user does not have the ability to decide whom the data are shared with. Technically this is linked to the problem of who owns the data encryption keys required to decrypt the data. Currently, cloud service providers, rather than users, have full rights to the key. In practical terms this makes the users lose full control over their data. Trust and uptake of these applications can be increased by allowing patients to feel in control of their data, generally stored in cloud-based services.
OBJECTIVE: This paper addresses this security challenge by providing the user a way of controlling encryption keys independently of the cloud service provider. We provide a secure and usable system that enables a patient to share health information with doctors and specialists.
METHODS: We contribute a secure protocol for patients to share their data with doctors and others on the cloud while keeping complete ownership. We developed a simple, stereotypical health application and carried out security tests, performance tests, and usability tests with both students and doctors (N=15).
RESULTS: We developed the health application as an app for Android mobile phones. We carried out the usability tests on potential participants and medical professionals. Of 20 participants, 14 (70\%) either agreed or strongly agreed that they felt safer using our system. Using mixed methods, we show that participants agreed that privacy and security of health data are important and that our system addresses these issues.
CONCLUSIONS: We presented a security protocol that enables patients to securely share their eHealth data with doctors and nurses and developed a secure and usable system that enables patients to share mental health information with doctors.},

	abstract = {From the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and the newly passed healthcare reform legislation to emerging reimbursement models and shifting consumer health trends, a confluence of events are driving radical change in the nation's healthcare system and bringing about the convergence of telehealth, electronic health records (EHRs) and health information exchange (HIE). That is the focus of "The Crossroads of Telehealth, Electronic Health Records \& Health Information Exchange: Planning for Rural Communities," a new white paper from the Northwest Regional Telehealth Resource Center (NRTRC). "Accelerating adoption and utilization of telehealth technologies, telemedicine in particular, will be critical to a successful stakeholder response to the disruptive changes that are underway in healthcare," said NRTRC Executive Director Christina B. Thielst, FACHE. "By leveraging telehealth networks and their existing infrastructures, Regional Extension Centers, HIEs and other data-sharing initiatives will be better-positioned to fulfill their commitments to the healthcare delivery system of the future--a system in which even the most rural and remote populations have timely access to care and their health records." The white paper explores emerging trends and recent disruptors impacting the healthcare delivery system and examines the opportunities they present for the advancement of telecommunications-based health solutions and the broadband infrastructure available through telehealth networks. It also takes an in-depth look at the various uses of telehealth and the most common delivery models of telemedicine, as well as the role of the telehealth network and Telehealth Resource Centers (TRCs) in expanding the reach of these vital initiatives. Finally, the white paper highlights the evolution of the REACH Montana Telehealth Network from facilitating teleradiology at three remote sites into a consortium of healthcare providers at 18 sites linked by high-bandwidth telecommunications in the north central region of Montana. REACH, which considers HIE to be a primary function, is currently working to leverage its existing T1 infrastructure to create the "railroad tracks" that will carry medical data and information within the region and beyond. "This white paper is an excellent analysis of the intersection of telehealth and health information technology, and the opportunities and challenges this electronic technology will bring to rural America," said Terry J. Hill, Executive Director of the Rural Health Resource Center, the Duluth, Minn.-based national knowledge center for rural hospitals providing technical assistance, information, education and other resources to rural health care providers and their communities. Adds Thielst: "Crossroads is a valuable planning tool for any healthcare stakeholder, but it is especially important for rural communities wanting to address health information exchange. It is just one of many resources available through the NRTRC to help advance the involvement of teleheatlh networks in HIE initiatives and to help transform the telehealth infrastructure into the 'superhighway' across which remote and rural areas will finally be able to participate in the widespread exchange of electronic health information." One of five TRCs in the nation, the NRTRC leverages the collective expertise of 33 telehealth networks across Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, and United States-affiliated Pacific Islands to share information and resources which assist in the development of new telehealth programs. The NRTRC is focused on further growth and new provider adoption of telehealth technologies to enhance delivery systems and reduce organizational and patient costs.},

Interviewees included payers, doctors and their professional associations; and patients and their organizations. These individuals were asked what their expectations were in the application of telemedicine. According to the interviewees, several changes in the healthcare system as a whole will occur, which influence telemedicine. These include increase in cost pressure; the changing role of the payers and companies--as opposed to public organizations--playing a more active role in managing care. Physicians foresee more changes than payers do. Patients expect telemedicine to strengthen their role as patients. Most important telemedicine applications will be the "Gesundheitskarte" (a smart card enabling access to patient records), telemedicine as an enabling technology for other provider integration models, information systems for patients, and telemonitoring.

Primarily developed to provide equitable access to individuals who are geographically remote and to those who are physically and economically disadvantaged, telerehabilitation also has the capacity to improve the quality of rehabilitation health care. Online delivery of rehabilitation enables the rehabilitation therapist to optimize the timing, intensity and duration of therapy that is often not possible within the constraints of face-to-face treatment protocols in current health systems. This chapter outlines the advances made to date in telerehabilitation applications in the fields of physiotherapy, speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, and biomedical engineering and provides evidence for the success of these applications. Applications to date encompass systems ranging from low-bandwidth low-cost videophones, to highly expensive, fully immersive virtual reality systems with haptic interfaces. A number of barriers to the establishment and advancement of telerehabilitation within health care systems have been outlined and include professional issues relating to the inherent hands-on approach of some treatments, licensure laws, professional skill development, patient disability, reimbursement, and the paucity of online assessment and treatment tools and outcomes data. In response, possible solutions to these barriers such as the development and validation of alternative assessment and treatment procedures, involvement in the international policy debate, as well as the resolution of national professional policies which hinder the wider uptake of telerehabilitation technologies, have been outlined. The future of telerehabilitation is promising as a new, yet complex form of telehealth with the capacity to provide a wide range of services specifically designed to suit the needs of the individual.},

Transaction cost economic analysis can provide comparative evaluation of the consequences of these changes in the delivery of care. The aim of this study was to establish proof-of-concept using transaction cost analysis to examine chronic pain management in-clinic and through telehealth.
METHODS: Participating health care providers were asked to identify and describe two comparable completed transactions for patients with chronic pain: one consultation between patient and specialist in-clinic and the other a telehealth presentation of a patient's case by the primary care provider to a team of pain medicine specialists. Each provider completed two on-site interviews. Focus was on the time, value of time, and labor costs per transaction. Number of steps, time, and costs for providers and patients were identified.
RESULTS: Forty-six discrete steps were taken for the in-clinic transaction, and 27 steps were taken for the telehealth transaction. Although similar in costs per patient (\$332.89 in-clinic vs. \$376.48 telehealth), the costs accrued over 153 business days in-clinic and 4 business days for telehealth. Time elapsed between referral and completion of initial consultation was 72 days in-clinic, 4 days for telehealth.
CONCLUSIONS: U.S. health care is moving toward the use of more technologies and practices, and the information provided by transaction cost analyses of care delivery for pain management will be important to determine actual cost savings and benefits.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Financial limitations and the scarcity of technological knowledge are a major hurdle to good communication platforms, data storage, and dissemination of medical knowledge in developing countries. Out of necessity we used free-to-use apps in our practice. We studied the applicability and cost effective aspect of a systematic use of these apps in neurosurgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed the Free-to-use apps in neurosurgery (FAN) module in 4 phases at Kathmandu Medical College Teaching Hospital over the last 3 years. We used free apps like Viber, Dropbox, Skype, and VLC media player on 3G and Wi-Fi network. Users were trained in ethics and measures to ensure confidentiality and privacy of patient-related data. Endpoints studied were feasibility, reliability, cost effectiveness, and overall satisfaction of the users.
RESULTS: In the FAN module, the Viber app was used to send pictures of digital images via smartphones within 30 minutes, enabling quick decisions by the consultants. Dropbox not only helped store images but also helped quick verification of discharge summaries as early as 15 minutes increasing overall efficiency. With Skype, consultants could be contacted even when they were abroad, and with the use of FAN they remain updated of their patients. By the use of Skype and VLC media player, 2 operative live workshops from abroad were transmitted live with good visual and audio reception, allowing question-and-answer sessions with the faculties. User satisfaction was more than 90\%.
CONCLUSIONS: The FAN module helped in quick reliable decision making, allowing for instantaneous communication and storing data and exchange of knowledge across countries.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In low-income countries with limited infrastructure, remote diagnoses are a sustainable solution to healthcare issues. Current electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring devices are very expensive and may not be feasible in rural areas. Because a seizure is nonstationary, composed of multiple frequencies, and difficult to acquire, visual and conventional frequency-based methods have limited application.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred healthy individuals at their best possible conscious state and 25 patients with an epileptic seizure a few hours prior to the time of recording were chosen. The recordings were carried at Shri Preethi Hospital and Nanda Engineering College, Tamilnadu, India, during the period of June 2014-December 2014. The primary objective was to differentiate the diseased from normal individuals, as well as quantifying the EEG signal and diagnosing remotely.
RESULTS: Using wavelet coefficients, the separation between seizure and nonseizure states was measured and compared with that of healthy individuals of different age groups. The systems performance was measured by parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, region of convergence, and precision rate.
CONCLUSIONS: The novelty of this article lies in the design, development, and clinical analysis of a low-cost EEG device for remote diagnosis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost analysis of a telemedicine model for cancer care (teleoncology) in northern Queensland, Australia, compared with the usual model of care from the perspective of the Townsville and other participating hospital and health services.
DESIGN: Retrospective cost-savings analysis; and a one-way sensitivity analysis performed to test the robustness of findings in net savings.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Records of all patients managed by means of teleoncology at the Townsville Cancer Centre (TCC) and its six rural satellite centres in northern Queensland, Australia between 1 March 2007 and 30 November 2011.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs for set-up and staffing to manage the service, and savings from avoidance of travel expenses for specialist oncologists, patients and their escorts, and for aeromedical retrievals.
RESULTS: There were 605 teleoncology consultations with 147 patients over 56 months, at a total cost of \$442 276. The cost for project establishment was \$36 000, equipment/maintenance was \$143 271, and staff was \$261 520. The estimated travel expense avoided was \$762 394; this figure included the costs of travel for patients and escorts of \$658 760, aeromedical retrievals of \$52 400 and travel for specialists of \$47 634, as well as an estimate of accommodation costs for a proportion of patients of \$3600. This resulted in a net saving of \$320 118. Costs would have to increase by 72\% to negate the savings.
CONCLUSION: The teleoncology model of care at the TCC resulted in net savings, mainly due to avoidance of travel costs. Such savings could be redirected to enhancing rural resources and service capabilities. This teleoncology model is applicable to geographically distant areas requiring lengthy travel.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE The utility of telemedicine (TM) in neurosurgery is underexplored, with most of the studies relating to teletrauma or telestroke programs. In this study, the authors evaluate the cost-effectiveness of TM consultations for follow-up care of a large population of patients who underwent neurosurgical procedures. METHODS A decision-analytical model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of TM for elective post-neurosurgical care patients from a predominantly nonurban cohort in West Bengal, India. The model compared TM care via a nodal center in West Bengal to routine, in-person, per-episode care at the provider site in Bangalore, India. Cost and effectiveness data relating to 1200 patients were collected for a 52-month period. The effectiveness of TM care was calculated using efficiency in terms of the percentage of successful TM consultations, as well as patient-perceived utility values for overall experience of the type of health care access that they received. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) analysis was done using the 4-quadrant charting of the cost-effectiveness plane. One-way sensitivity and tornado analyses were performed to identify thresholds where the care strategy would change. RESULTS The overall utility for the 3 TM scenarios was found to be higher (89\%) than for the utility of routine care (80\%). TM was found to be more cost-effective (Indian rupee [INR] 2630 per patient) compared to routine care (INR 6848 per patient). The TM strategy "dominates" that of routine care by being more effective and less expensive (ICER value of -39,400 INR/unit of effectiveness). Sensitivity analysis revealed that cost-effectiveness of TM was most sensitive to changes in the number of TM patients, utility and success rate of TM, and travel distance to the TM center. CONCLUSIONS TM care dominates the in-person care strategy by providing more effective and less expensive follow-up care for a remote post-neurosurgical care population in India. In the authors' setting, this benefit of TM is sustainable even if half the TM consultations turn out to be unsuccessful. The viability of TM as a cost-effective care protocol is attributed to a combination of factors, like an adequate patient volume utilizing TM, patient utility, success rate of TM, and the patient travel distance.},

DESIGN: Randomized controlled study.
PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: One hundred three subjects with 160 pressure ulcers (PrUs) or nonhealing surgical wounds referred to a metropolitan Visiting Nurse Agency.
INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Group A (n = 40): weekly visits with TM and wound care specialist (WCS) consults; group B (n = 28): weekly visits with weekly consults with WCSs; and group C (n = 35): usual and customary care.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were time to heal, costs, length of stay (LOS), nursing visits, wound status, and change in size.
RESULTS: There was a similar distribution of subject characteristics in all 3 groups, but group A had disproportionally larger and more numerous PrUs and larger nonhealing surgical wounds. Group A had increased time to heal, LOS, costs, and visits compared with groups B and C; wound status was similar in all groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Uneven distribution of severity and type of wounds among groups, with greatest percentage of large wounds in TM group. Larger wounds consume more resources. TM is a useful communication tool in wound management but with limited power when randomization does not include wound size or type. Two important benchmarks were established for home care. First, it took 51 days, on average, to heal or improve PrUs and 34 days to heal or improve surgical wounds regardless of group. Second, nearly 90\% of wounds improved or healed.},

METHODS: A model-based analysis was conducted to determine the potential costs of implementing TD at the RCH. The outcome measure was timely consultations (whether the patient presented within an appropriate time according to the recommended schedule). Dental records at the RCH of those who presented for orthodontic or pediatric dental consultations were assessed. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), comparing TD with the traditional method of consultation, was conducted. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of the results. Results and Materials: A total of 367 TD appropriate consultations were identified, of which 241 were timely (65.7\%). The mean cost of a RCH consultation was A\$431.29, with the mean TD consult costing A\$294.35. This represents a cost saving of A\$136.95 per appointment. The CEA found TD to be a dominant option, with cost savings of A\$3,160.81 for every additional timely consult. The model indicated that 36.7 days of clinic time may be freed up at the RCH to treat other patients and expand capacity. These results were robust when performing one-way sensitivity analysis.
CONCLUSION: When taking a societal perspective, the implementation of TD is likely to be a cost-effective alternative compared with the standard practice of face-to-face consultation at the RCH.},

Therefore, this study determined the depth accuracy of the RealSense, in a cohort of patients with a unilateral facial palsy (n = 34), by using the clinically validated 3dMD system as a gold standard. The patients were simultaneously recorded with both systems, capturing six Sunnybrook poses. This study has shown that the RealSense depth accuracy was not affected by a facial palsy (1.48 ± 0.28 mm), compared to a healthy face (1.46 ± 0.26 mm). Furthermore, the Sunnybrook poses did not influence the RealSense depth accuracy (p = 0.76). However, the distance of the patients to the RealSense was shown to affect the accuracy of the system, where the highest depth accuracy of 1.07 mm was measured at a distance of 35 cm. Overall, this study has shown that the RealSense can provide reliable and accurate depth data when recording a range of facial movements. Therefore, when the portability, low-costs, and availability of the RealSense are taken into consideration, the camera is a viable option for 4D close range imaging in telehealth.},

The primary objectives were to: (1) determine cost savings differences in medical expenditures between engaged and non-engaged members referred to a HF management program; (2) examine differences in length of stay and time to first post-engagement acute inpatient admission; and (3) examine the impact of using a remote weight monitoring scale on medical expenditures and inpatient admissions. Generalized linear modeling was used to compare key outcomes among individuals who engaged in the program and a propensity-matched cohort of those who were eligible but did not engage. Key outcomes included post-engagement acute inpatient medical service utilization, all-cause per-member-per-month medical expenses, and acute inpatient length of stay. When paired with regular use of a remote weight monitoring scale, engagement in this HF management program appears to be associated with decreased risk for acute inpatient admission and lower all-cause medical expenditures. Participation in a clinically based HF management program may improve health-related and financial outcomes among older individuals. However, further development and evaluation of disease management programs could help to improve their effectiveness and thus patient outcomes.},

METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting a change in HbA1c after usual care and telemedicine intervention were retrieved from electronic databases.
RESULTS: Data on 6,170 participants (mean age 13.3 to 71.0 years), with 3,128 randomized to usual care and 3,042 to telemedicine intervention, were retrieved from 42 RCTs. Eight studies used teleconsultation, while 34 used telemonitoring (device based). Nine studies enrolled both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients, 21 focused on type 2 diabetes patients, and 12 on type 1 diabetes patients. The mean reduction in HbA1c was significantly higher in the telemedicine groups (Hedges' g = -0.37, p {\textless} 0.001). Type 2 diabetes patients experienced a higher reduction in HbA1c compared to type 1 diabetes patients (Hedges' g = -0.48, p {\textless} 0.001 vs. -0.26, p {\textless} 0.05; Q = 1935.75, p {\textless} 0.0001).

	abstract = {Objective The provision of healthcare services to inmates in correctional facilities is costly and resource-intensive. This study aimed to estimate the costs of transporting prisoners from 11 Queensland correctional facilities to the Princess Alexandra Hospital Secure Unit (PAHSU) in Brisbane for non-urgent specialist outpatient consultations and identify the cost consequences that would result from the substitution of face-to-face visits with telehealth consultations. Methods A 12-month retrospective review of patient activity at the PAHSU was conducted to obtain the number of transfers per correctional facility. The total cost of transfers was calculated with estimates for transport vehicle costs and correctional staff escort wages, per diem and accommodation costs. A cost model was developed to estimate the potential cost savings from substituting face-to-face consultations with telehealth consultations. A sensitivity analysis on the cost variables was conducted. Costs are reported from a government funding perspective and presented in 2016 Australian dollars (A\$). Results There were 3539 inmate appointments from July 2015 to June 2016 at the PAHSU, primarily for imaging, general practice, and orthopaedics. Telehealth may result in cost savings from negligible to A\$969731, depending on the proportion, and travel distance, of face-to-face consultations substituted by telehealth. Wages of correctional staff were found to be the most sensitive variable. Conclusions Under the modelled conditions, telehealth may reduce the cost of providing specialist outpatient consultations to prisoners in Queensland correctional facilities. Telehealth may improve the timeliness of services to a traditionally underserved population. What is known about the topic? Specialist medical services are located in only a few metropolitan centres across Australia, which requires some populations to travel long distances to attend appointments. Some face-to-face specialist outpatient consultations can be substituted by telehealth. What does this paper add? Prisoners from correctional facilities represent one specific population that requires complex travel arrangements for specialist medical appointments. Transportation of prisoners for specialist health appointments represents a substantial cost to the government. This paper quantifies the annual cost in Queensland for transporting prisoners, taking into account fuel and vehicle costs, staff wages, per diem rates, and accommodation. In addition, it quantifies the costs of substituting face-to-face consultations with telehealth consultations. What are the implications for practitioners? This research encourages practitioners to consider using telehealth services for prisoners, as well providing an argument for tertiary centres to include telehealth as a model of care for this population. Telehealth can result in major cost savings and state and federal governments should consider implementation especially in Australia where correctional facilities and specialist services are separated by great geographic distances.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an outpatient, interprofessional telehealth chronic care management (CCM) pilot program.
METHODS: This 6-month program integrated family medicine providers, a university-based medication management telepharmacist, and an interprofessional care coordinator using telehealth solutions for CCM and pharmacy education services. A physician referred patients at risk for medicine-related problems to the telepharmacist. Eligible patients had 3 or more chronic conditions or took at least 5 medications, were aged 18 years and older, and had at least 1 appointment with their primary care provider during the program. The care coordinator met patients in person to facilitate these virtual clinic processes. The telepharmacist conducted a comprehensive medication review (CMR) via video-conferencing technology, providing CCM based on primary diagnosis, current medications and allergies, laboratory results, and previous chart notes. The consultation was documented in the electronic health record (EHR) for provider review and modification in real time.
RESULTS: 69 patients received telepharmacy consultations and on-site registered nurse support during the program. Most patients were female (56.5\%), aged 51-70 years (60.1\%), Caucasian (72.4\%), and non-Hispanic/Latino (71.0\%). Patients had 1-9 chronic conditions, such as hypertension (82.6\%), diabetes (56.5\%), hyperlipidemia (31.9\%), depression (30.4\%), and osteoporosis (29.0\%). Most patients (94.2\%) took at least 5 chronic disease medications, such as statins (11.2\%), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (8.4\%), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (6.5\%), beta blockers (6.5\%), and calcium channel blockers (5.6\%). The telepharmacist completed 200 interventions for safety (49.0\%), vaccines (24.5\%), care gaps per national consensus guidelines (13.5\%), adherence (10.0\%), and cost savings (3.0\%). Patients' providers accepted one third (n = 75, 37.5\%) of the telepharmacist recommendations (e.g., monitoring and medication changes).
CONCLUSIONS: This telehealth program constituted an added service for patients while simultaneously filling a gap in on-site pharmacist counseling services. Integrating the telepharmacist and registered nurse was crucial to clinical service provision. The results are encouraging; however, more research must examine the effectiveness of telehealth services in reaching underserved populations, improving patient care, and decreasing health care costs.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite being a rare disorder, hemophilia represents a significant driver of health care resource utilization and requires expert hematologic and multidisciplinary services to achieve optimal outcomes. Since their inception nearly 40 years ago, hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) have served as centers of excellence in providing the intensive care and ancillary services necessary for this unique patient base; however, the full capabilities of these centers may be underused in the current framework of managed care, largely because of a lack of communication and information shared between payers and HTC stakeholders.
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: In an effort to enact tangible change toward improving the quality of care for bleeding disorders, the National Hemophilia Foundation developed an ongoing initiative among 18 leading clinicians and managed care decision makers called the Comprehensive Care Sustainability Collaborative (CCSC). The primary aim of the CCSC is to develop a framework for quality improvement pilot programs that can be replicated across the United States between payers and HTCs to facilitate cost-effective hemophilia management by integrating the HTC comprehensive care model.
OBSERVATIONS: After CCSC committee members shared perspectives on care delivery, quality, and value, actionable data points were reviewed at length in order to develop meaningful metrics to facilitate information sharing between HTC and payer stakeholders. The following pragmatic measures will be reported by HTCs and payers via a series of pilot programs (reporting group is indicated in brackets): (a) patient classification by diagnosis (type, severity, and inhibitor status) [HTC]; (b) total cost of clotting factor [payer]; (c) prescribed factor dose/dispensed dose/patient weight (± range) [payer and HTC]; (d) emergency department visits/hospitalizations [payer and HTC]; (e) home infusion of clotting factor (\%) [HTC]; (f) total cost per patient [payer]; and (g) patient contacts (e.g., clinic visits, follow-ups, telemedicine, and e-mail) [HTC].
IMPLICATIONS: Routine information sharing between HTCs and payer stakeholders is paramount to improving the quality and reducing the cost of hemophilia care, and the CCSC initiative provides a unique forum for such dialogue. Over the course of several consensus meetings, the CCSC has rigorously developed a set of quality improvement and cost management metrics. These metrics will be used in a first-of-its-kind series of pilot projects that are anticipated to forge innovative collaboration between payers and HTCs so as to improve outcomes in the management of bleeding disorders.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To derive a computerized measurement of optic disc volume from digital stereoscopic fundus photographs for the purpose of diagnosing and managing papilledema.
METHODS: Twenty-nine pairs of stereoscopic fundus photographs and optic nerve head (ONH) centered spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans were obtained at the same visit in 15 patients with papilledema. Some patients were imaged at multiple visits in order to assess their changes. Three-dimensional shape of the ONH was estimated from stereo fundus photographs using an automated multi-scale stereo correspondence algorithm. We assessed the correlation of the stereo volume measurements with the SD-OCT volume measurements quantitatively, in terms of volume of retinal surface elevation above a reference plane and also to expert grading of papilledema from digital fundus photographs using the Frisén grading scale.
RESULTS: The volumetric measurements of retinal surface elevation estimated from stereo fundus photographs and OCT scans were positively correlated (correlation coefficient r(2) = 0.60; P {\textless} 0.001) and were positively correlated with Frisén grade (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.59; P {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Retinal surface elevation among papilledema patients obtained from stereo fundus photographs compares favorably with that from OCT scans and with expert grading of papilledema severity. Stereoscopic color imaging of the ONH combined with a method of automated shape reconstruction is a low-cost alternative to SD-OCT scans that has potential for a more cost-effective diagnosis and management of papilledema in a telemedical setting. An automated three-dimensional image analysis method was validated that quantifies the retinal surface topography with an imaging modality that has lacked prior objective assessment.},

	abstract = {This work presents a portable Linux-based electrocardiogram (ECG) signals measurement and monitoring system. The proposed system consists of an ECG front end and an embedded Linux platform (ELP). The ECG front end digitizes 12-lead ECG signals acquired from electrodes and then delivers them to the ELP via a universal serial bus (USB) interface for storage, signal processing, and graphic display. The proposed system can be installed anywhere (e.g., offices, homes, healthcare centers and ambulances) to allow people to self-monitor their health conditions at any time. The proposed system also enables remote diagnosis via Internet. Additionally, the system has a 7-in. interactive TFT-LCD touch screen that enables users to execute various functions, such as scaling a single-lead or multiple-lead ECG waveforms. The effectiveness of the proposed system was verified by using a commercial 12-lead ECG signal simulator and in vivo experiments. In addition to its portability, the proposed system is license-free as Linux, an open-source code, is utilized during software development. The cost-effectiveness of the system significantly enhances its practical application for personal healthcare.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Most outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) services use a hospital-based model of care in which patients remain in proximity to large hospitals facilitating clinical review. We aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes and complication rates for patients living in geographically isolated locations managed by telemedicine-supported OPAT. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study.
Results: Between 2011 and 2015, we delivered 88 episodes of care involving 83 adult patients resulting in 2261 days of OPAT. The median age was 56 years, 8 of 83 (10\%) were indigenous Australian and the median Charlson comorbidity index score was 2 (IQR 1-4). The median distance of patients' residence from our hospital was 288 km (IQR 201-715) and the median duration on the programme was 26 days (IQR 14-34). Bone and joint infections accounted for 75\% of infections treated. Favourable clinical outcomes (improvement or cure) were achieved in 87\% of patients and the unplanned, OPAT-related readmission rate was 8\%. Nineteen percent and 10\% of patients had drug-related and line-related adverse effects, respectively.
Conclusions: Despite a complex case mix, our adverse event and readmission rates are similar to the published literature describing a non-telemedicine model to deliver OPAT. High rates of favourable clinical outcomes and likely cost benefits suggest that telemedicine-supported OPAT is an efficacious and safe substitute for inpatient care in our setting.},

TR is proven to be helpful, with benefits in terms of reduced travel time, cost, and availability of specialists' support in local communities. However, TR systems that are usable under low-bandwidth network environments are rare. This article introduces the development of a TR system with customized consultation categories for users to choose from, depending on requirements. Each category, with its preset parameter values, is discussed in detail by demonstrating relevant rehabilitation exercises. A novel bandwidth adaptation algorithm is also presented for optimal utilization of the dynamic network conditions, which ensures the system functionality even under narrow-bandwidth environments. Experiment results show that the system is able to perform effectively in each consultation category while the rehabilitation exercises are being performed. The proposed algorithm is also verified for its ability to adapt the content quality and effectively utilize the network under constrained conditions. A survey conducted on the video quality of the system under low-bandwidth conditions shows encouraging results for a large scale deployment of the application.},

At the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Hyderabad, India, the Rural Health Care Project has been initiated in an attempt to provide cost-effective gastrointestinal care to the rural population. The Project was implemented by traveling to remote rural areas in a bus that had been converted into a mobile hospital and equipped with basic diagnostic facilities including a custom-made endoscopy unit. The mobile hospital and endoscopy unit is accompanied by a telemedicine vehicle that transmits all procedures and data to the main telemedicine center at the parent institute in Hyderabad. Our efforts have resulted in cost-effective management and robust data collection of several common gastrointestinal illnesses in remote rural areas of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. To date, 32756 endoscopic procedures have been carried out in a population of over 10 million people spanning 4837 villages. Overall, 72\% of the population has had a positive finding on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (primarily related to acid peptic diseases). Interestingly, {\textless}1\% of the population have had colonic polyps on screening colonoscopy, whereas the prevalence of infective colitis has been high. This whole exercise has produced a high level of satisfaction among both beneficiaries and care-givers; it has also offered doctors in training the opportunity to encounter and manage common public health-related problems.

This causes an increasing workload in care, which results in a growing need for structural changes of the health care system. In recent years this led to a strong focus on promoting "self-management" in chronically ill patients. Research showed that patients who understand more about their disease, health, and lifestyle have better experiences and health outcomes, and often use less health care resources; the effect is even more when these patients are empowered to and responsible for managing their health and disease. In addition to the skills of patients, health care professionals need to shift to a role of teacher, partner, and professional supervisor of their patients. One way of supervising patients is by the use of electronic health (eHealth), which helps patients manage and control their disease. The application of eHealth solutions can provide chronically ill patients high-quality care, to the satisfaction of both patients and health care professionals, alongside a reduction in health care consumption and costs.},

Improving accessibility of the African population to diabetes care seems to be a big challenge in most countries where the number of care centers and medical staff is reduced. Information and communication technologies (ICT) have great potential to address some of these challenges faced by several countries in providing accessible, cost-effective, and high-quality health care services. This paper presents the Mobil Diab system which is a telemedical approach proposed for the management of long-term diseases. The system applies modern mobile and web technologies which overcome geographical barriers, and increase access to health care services. The idea of the system is to involve patients in the therapy process and motivate them for an active participation. For validation of the system in African context, a trial was conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 40 Subjects with diabetes divided randomly into control and intervention groups were included in the test. Results show that Mobil Diab is suitable for African countries and presents a number of benefits for the population and public health care system. It improves clinical management and delivery of diabetes care services by enhancing access, quality, motivation, reassurance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.},

To avoid the need for hospital treatment, optimized monitoring and follow-up is crucial. Remote monitoring (RM) has been widely put into practice in the management of CIEDs but it may be difficult due to the presence of differences in systems provided by device manufacturers and loss of gathered data in case of device reimplantation. Additionally, conclusions derived from studies about usefulness of RM in clinical practice apply to devices coming only from a single company. An integrated monitoring platform allows for more comprehensive data analysis and interpretation. Therefore, the primary objective of Remote Supervision to Decrease Hospitalization Rate (RESULT) study is to evaluate the impact of RM on the clinical status of patients with ICDs or CRT-Ds using an integrated platform. Six hundred consecutive patients with ICDs or CRT-Ds implanted will be prospectively randomized to either a traditional or RM-based follow-up model. The primary clinical endpoint will be a composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons within 12 months after randomization. The primary technical endpoint will be to construct and evaluate a unified and integrated platform for the data collected from RM devices manufactured by different companies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Innovative technologies and informatics offer a wide range of services to health districts, doctors, nurses, and patients, and is changing the traditional concept of health care. In the last few years, the availability of portable devices, their easiness to transport and use, and the capability to collect and transmit various clinical data have resulted in the fast development of telemedicine. However, despite its potential impact in improving patient conditions, and its cost effectiveness reported in literature, telemedicine is not in daily practice.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide evidence of the positive impact of telemonitoring proving the sustainability of an application by sending spirometry outcomes from patients' homes to the hospital doctors via the Internet, and from doctors to patients by an additional phone call solution.
METHODS: We examined collected data related to clinical improvement of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The patients were followed-up at home using telemonitoring for a period of 10 years, with the aims to prove the sustainability of the methodology (transmissions of spirometry from the patients' home to the doctors and feedback from the doctors to the patients by phone call from the hospital). We stored and analyzed all spirometry transmissions received, and tested the possible presence to decrease the costs between the standard clinical trial (only ambulatory visits) and standard clinical trial with telemonitoring for the follow-up of patients with CF (telemedicine). This was done through an economic analysis of the costs for patients followed at home by telemonitoring. We assessed four years of observation and a simulation of total long-term costs between 2010 and 2020.
RESULTS: We discovered a potential saving of €40,397.00 per patient for 10 years, actualized at €36,802.97 for the follow-up of all patients enrolled.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from the study suggest that telemedicine can improve the health of patients with CF. It is a relatively cheap and potentially sustainable solution, compared to standard clinical trials. However, to establish and prove the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, more controlled psychological and behavioral studies are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the last 30 years, a great increase in the application of technologies in public health, with an undisputed impact on both the effectiveness of performance and the investment and management costs, has occurred. This evidence has induced the development of assessment tools to clarify the relationships among resources, outputs, and outcomes of technological innovations. This analysis was developed in order to examine the use of a telematic system for reporting remotely transmitted cardiotocographic traces, specifically (1) its impact on the health organization and on the appropriateness of the care setting used and (2) the efficiency of its adoption in a regional network.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adopted a case-control study on patients' medical records during the first 4 months of 2009, 2010, and 2011 and a cost analysis of resources used for the creation of a computerized telecardiotocography network connecting eight peripheral areas to the operations center.
RESULTS: The case-control study showed a reduction in the average hospital stay days for high-risk patients (1.32) and for low-risk patient (1.7) with a total of cost savings of €89,628 for high-risk patients and €170,170 for low-risk patients. The cost savings of the regional network was €20,769.04.
CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of a remote transmission system of cardiotocography provided a managerial and economic advantage in the reduction of inappropriate admissions for prepartum symptoms and an improvement in the admission indicators (hospital stay days).},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the central data store, including all cCTG records collected in Campania region (Italy) during 17 years of activity. The Operations Center acquires the traces recorded in the Remote Units and simultaneously performs a complex fetal heart rate analysis. An Internet or phone conference calling is available to discuss the information transmitted. Finally, the report is send back to the Remote Units.
RESULTS: The number of cCTG traces performed was constantly increasing, despite the progressive reduction in the number of peripheral units involved. Pregnant women in Remote Unit group were younger and overweight and showed a higher incidence of diabetes and fetal defects than Operations Center ones. Moreover, a high rate of African migrant women and low socioeconomic and cultural standards were found in Remote Unit group. The cost analysis showed an economic advantage both in the reduction of inappropriate admissions and in the improvement of admission indicators (hospital stay days) for pregnant women.
DISCUSSION: The global economic recession has had a significant impact on the Italian regional healthcare system and socioeconomic deprivation.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine could avoid unnecessary referral to Level III centers (Hospital) in Campania region, where the average population density is very high, allowing equal access to ultra-specialist assessment irrespective of the geographical location of the pregnant woman with medium to high risk, as well as rationalizing the costs for maternal and fetal care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A hub-and-spoke telestroke network is an effective way to extend quality acute stroke care to remote hospitals and to improve patient outcomes. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of a telestroke network in the management of acute ischemic stroke from the perspectives of a network, a hub hospital, and a spoke hospital.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A model was developed to compare costs and effectiveness with and without a telestroke network over a 5-year time horizon. The model considered differences in rates of teleconsultations, intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular stroke therapies, and spoke-to-hub transfers. These inputs were estimated through the use of data from Georgia Health Sciences University and Mayo Clinic telestroke networks. A network model with 1 hub and 7 spokes predicted that 45 more patients would be treated with intravenous thrombolysis and 20 more with endovascular stroke therapies per year compared with no network, leading to an estimate of 6.11 more home discharges. Each year, a telestroke network was associated with \$358 435 in cost savings; each spoke had \$109 080 in cost savings, whereas the hub had positive costs of \$405 121. However, cost sharing can be arranged so that each hospital could achieve an equal amount of cost savings (\$44 804/y). Results were sensitive to the number of spokes, marginal treatment costs in spokes and rates of transfer, and endovascular stroke therapies.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that a telestroke network may increase the number of patients discharged home and reduce the costs borne by the network hospitals. Hospitals should consider their available resources and the network features when deciding whether to join or set up a network.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Information and communication and technology (ICT) has changed the entire paradigm of society. ICT facilitates people to use medical services over the Internet, thereby reducing the travel cost, hospitalization cost and time to a greater extent. Recent advancements in Telecare Medicine Information System (TMIS) facilitate users/patients to access medical services over the Internet by gaining health monitoring facilities at home.
METHODS: Amin and Biswas recently proposed a RSA-based user authentication and session key agreement protocol usable for TMIS, which is an improvement over Giri et al.'s RSA-based user authentication scheme for TMIS. In this paper, we show that though Amin-Biswas's scheme considerably improves the security drawbacks of Giri et al.'s scheme, their scheme has security weaknesses as it suffers from attacks such as privileged insider attack, user impersonation attack, replay attack and also offline password guessing attack. A new RSA-based user authentication scheme for TMIS is proposed, which overcomes the security pitfalls of Amin-Biswas's scheme and also preserves user anonymity property.
RESULTS: The careful formal security analysis using the two widely accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and the random oracle models is done. Moreover, the informal security analysis of the scheme is also done. These security analyses show the robustness of our new scheme against the various known attacks as well as attacks found in Amin-Biswas's scheme. The simulation of the proposed scheme using the widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool is also done.
CONCLUSIONS: We present a new user authentication and session key agreement scheme for TMIS, which fixes the mentioned security pitfalls found in Amin-Biswas's scheme, and we also show that the proposed scheme provides better security than other existing schemes through the rigorous security analysis and verification tool. Furthermore, we present the formal security verification of our scheme using the widely accepted AVISPA tool. High security and extra functionality features allow our proposed scheme to be applicable for telecare medicine information systems which is used for e-health care medical applications.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Studies suggest that African American women are less likely to pursue BRCA1/2 genetic testing than white women. However, such studies are often confounded by unequal access to care.
METHODS: Data from 132 African American and 636 white women, obtained from a clinical database at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC) between 1998 and 2005, were analyzed to assess BRCA1/2 genetic testing uptake. Importantly, the clinical setting minimized barriers of both cost and access. Race and time of new breast cancer diagnosis (recent v {\textgreater} 1 year before genetic evaluation) were assessed for association with BRCA1/2 testing uptake using multivariable logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Both race (P = .0082) and a recent diagnosis of breast cancer (P = .014) were independently associated with testing uptake. African American women had a lower estimated odds of pursuing testing than white women (odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95\%CI, 0.34 to 0.85), and women with a recent diagnosis had a higher OR than those with a remote diagnosis (OR, 1.58; 95\% CI, 1.10 to 2.29). In a race-stratified analysis, there was no statistical evidence for association between recent status and testing uptake in the larger white stratum (OR, 1.38, P = .13) while there was for the smaller African American sample (OR, 2.77, P = .018). The test of interaction between race and remote status was not significant (P = .15).
CONCLUSION: African American race was associated with an overall decreased uptake of BRCA1/2 genetic testing, even when barriers of ascertainment and cost were minimized. However, among African American women, a recent diagnosis of breast cancer was associated with substantially increased uptake of testing.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was designed as a 2-armed partially blinded parallel randomized controlled trial. Seven sites in the United Kingdom (UK) recruited a total of 202 adults with heart failure at high risk of adverse outcomes and with potential to benefit from remote management (mean age 73 years, 28\% female, median left ventricular ejection fraction 37\%). Both arms are given a home monitoring and communication kit (Internet-enabled tablet computer, Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure and heart rate monitor, and weighing scale). For each participant, an individualized plan for treatment of heart failure and major comorbidities is developed before randomization. Participants randomized to intervention receive regular feedback to support self-management, and their physicians receive advice on blood investigations and pharmacological treatment from a central specialist heart failure team. Participants in the control arm use the same monitoring system but with no central medical management support. The primary outcome is the use of recommended medical therapy, defined as treatment consistent with the guidelines for management of patients with chronic heart failure, and will be measured as a composite opportunity score. The trial data collection ended in October 2017, and results will be reported in 2019.

Recent imaging PPG studies have concentrated on two broad research directions involving either high-performance cameras and or webcam-based systems. However, little has been reported about the difference between these two techniques, particularly in terms of their performance under illumination with ambient light. We explore these two imaging PPG approaches through the simultaneous measurement of the cardiac pulse acquired from the face of 10 male subjects and the spectral characteristics of ambient light. Measurements are made before and after a period of cycling exercise. The physiological pulse waves extracted from both imaging PPG systems using the smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution yield functional characteristics comparable to those acquired using gold standard contact PPG sensors. The influence of ambient light intensity on the physiological information is considered, where results reveal an independent relationship between the ambient light intensity and the normalized plethysmographic signals. This provides further support for imaging PPG as a means for practical noncontact physiological assessment with clear applications in several domains, including telemedicine and homecare.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The optical appearance of human skin is highly dependent on the interaction between the illumination (type and position), observer position and the skin surface structure. Different currently available photographic techniques record different aspects of this appearance, each providing its own incomplete description. This limits their usefulness, especially for pigmented skin lesion diagnosis. In this paper a new, easy to use, low-cost photographic method is described,which aims to generate an efficiently encoded yet reasonably complete representation of skin appearance.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prototype hand-held camera was developed that rapidly acquires six colour images, each with the skin illuminated from a different direction. A novel photometric stereo processing was used to combine these into a colour image of the skin's diffuse reflectance, independent of the skin surface topography, as well as a separate representation of that topography in the form of a surface gradient image. Images of four clinical pigmented skin lesions were evaluated in comparison with conventional digital photographs by both visual judgement and automated lesion boundary detection.
RESULTS: The new colour reflectance images were free from the effects of topographical shading, shadowing and specular reflections. Lesion boundaries obtained automatically from the reflectance images were always closer to the outline drawn by a dermatologist than those obtained from conventional photographs. Finally, recombining the colour reflectance and surface gradient data to form a virtual image of the skin surface that is highly realistic in appearance.
CONCLUSIONS: The new colour photometric stereo camera produces images of skin and skin tumours in which the reflectance information that is related to subsurface pigment distribution is separated from the surface topographic information. The total information generated by the system, for use in visual or automated analysis, is potentially greater than that for either conventional photography or dermatoscopy alone. Its further development and broader clinical evaluation are warranted to determine its usefulness and role in a wide range of dermatological tasks, including tele-dermatology applications.},

	doi = {10.1186/1475-2875-8-164},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Deficits in clinical microbiology infrastructure exacerbate global infectious disease burdens. This paper examines how commodity computation, communication, and measurement products combined with open-source analysis and communication applications can be incorporated into laboratory medicine microbiology protocols. Those commodity components are all now sourceable globally. An informatics model is presented for guiding the use of low-cost commodity components and free software in the assembly of clinically useful and usable telemicrobiology workstations.
METHODS: The model incorporates two general principles: 1) collaborative diagnostics, where free and open communication and networking applications are used to link distributed collaborators for reciprocal assistance in organizing and interpreting digital diagnostic data; and 2) commodity engineering, which leverages globally available consumer electronics and open-source informatics applications, to build generic open systems that measure needed information in ways substantially equivalent to more complex proprietary systems. Routine microscopic examination of Giemsa and fluorescently stained blood smears for diagnosing malaria is used as an example to validate the model.
RESULTS: The model is used as a constraint-based guide for the design, assembly, and testing of a functioning, open, and commoditized telemicroscopy system that supports distributed acquisition, exploration, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of digital microscopy images of stained malarial blood smears while also supporting remote diagnostic tracking, quality assessment and diagnostic process development.
CONCLUSION: The open telemicroscopy workstation design and use-process described here can address clinical microbiology infrastructure deficits in an economically sound and sustainable manner. It can boost capacity to deal with comprehensive measurement of disease and care outcomes in individuals and groups in a distributed and collaborative fashion. The workstation enables local control over the creation and use of diagnostic data, while allowing for remote collaborative support of diagnostic data interpretation and tracking. It can enable global pooling of malaria disease information and the development of open, participatory, and adaptable laboratory medicine practices. The informatic model highlights how the larger issue of access to generic commoditized measurement, information processing, and communication technology in both high- and low-income countries can enable diagnostic services that are much less expensive, but substantially equivalent to those currently in use in high-income countries.},

Considering that some patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) live in rural, remote and limited accessibility areas, the use of Telemedicine (TM) can optimize diag nosis, follow-up and prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: Reporting 10 years of experience of a mixed care model: face-to-face and distance, using basic TM; the institutional impact, advantages, disadvantages and acceptance informed by parents and patients.
PATIENTS AND METHOD: Exploratory, descriptive, and re trospective study with qualitative component. After the authorization of a scientific-ethics committee of the Reloncaví Health Service and the application of informed consent, a review of medical records was carried out and a qualitative survey was applied to parents and children over 14 years of age with JIA, seen between 2005-2015 in the pediatric ambulatory rheumatology polyclinic of Puerto Montt Hospital.
RESULTS: The were 27/35 participating patients with JIA attended by a trained pediatrician and assisted by distance (1,000 km) by an immunologist. The 8/35 patients did not answer by choice or change of address. The 70\% of parents and patients accepted the model of care and 4\% would pre fer sporadic care only by specialists for diagnosis and follow-up. The number of patients transferred annually decreased from 10 to 1. The advantages of the care model outweighed the disadvantages perceived by parents and JIA patients.
CONCLUSION: The use of TM tools in JIA decreased transfers, improved follow-up and were considered advantageous by patients and their parents.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the costs and cost-effectiveness of managing patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) using telemonitoring versus usual care from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS).
DESIGN: Within trial post hoc economic evaluation of data from a pragmatic randomised controlled trial using an intention-to-treat approach.
SETTING: 20 socioeconomically diverse general practices in Lothian, Scotland.
PARTICIPANTS: 401 primary care patients aged 29-95 with uncontrolled daytime ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) (≥135/85, but {\textless}210/135 mm Hg).
INTERVENTION: Participants were centrally randomised to 6 months of a telemonitoring service comprising of self-monitoring of BP transmitted to a secure website for review by the attending nurse/doctor and patient, with optional automated patient decision-support by text/email (n=200) or usual care (n-201). Randomisation was undertaken with minimisation for age, sex, family practice, use of three or more hypertension drugs and self-monitoring history.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean difference in total NHS costs between trial arms and blinded assessment of mean cost per 1 mm Hg systolic BP point reduced.
RESULTS: Home telemonitoring of BP costs significantly more than usual care (mean difference per patient £115.32 (95\% CI £83.49 to £146.63; p{\textless}0.001)). Increased costs were due to telemonitoring service costs, patient training and additional general practitioner and nurse consultations. The mean cost of systolic BP reduction was £25.56/mm Hg (95\% CI £16.06 to £46.89) per patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Over the 6-month trial period, supported telemonitoring was more effective at reducing BP than usual care but also more expensive. If clinical gains are maintained, these additional costs would be very likely to be compensated for by reductions in the cost of future cardiovascular events. Longer-term modelling of costs and outcomes is required to fully examine the cost-effectiveness implications.

Total healthcare costs were estimated over a 12-month period from a National Health Service perspective and quality adjusted life year (QALYs) were estimated by the EQ-5D tool. Telemonitoring was not significantly more costly than usual care (mean difference per patient £2065.90 (P {\textless} 0.18). The increased costs were predominantly due to telemonitoring service costs and non-significantly higher secondary care costs. Telemonitoring for COPD was not cost-effective at a base case of £137,277 per QALY with only 15\% probability of being cost-effective at the usual threshold of £30,000 per QALY. Although there was some statistical and methodological uncertainty in the measures used, telemonitoring was not cost-effective in the sensitivity analyses performed. It seems unlikely that a telemonitoring service of the kind that was trialled would be cost-effective in providing care for people with COPD.},

DESIGN: Pragmatic, multisite, cluster randomised trial comparing telehealth with usual care, using data from routine administrative datasets. General practice was the unit of randomisation. We allocated practices using a minimisation algorithm, and did analyses by intention to treat.
SETTING: 179 general practices in three areas in England.
PARTICIPANTS: 3230 people with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or heart failure recruited from practices between May 2008 and November 2009.
INTERVENTIONS: Telehealth involved remote exchange of data between patients and healthcare professionals as part of patients' diagnosis and management. Usual care reflected the range of services available in the trial sites, excluding telehealth.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of patients admitted to hospital during 12 month trial period.
RESULTS: Patient characteristics were similar at baseline. Compared with controls, the intervention group had a lower admission proportion within 12 month follow-up (odds ratio 0.82, 95\% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.97, P = 0.017). Mortality at 12 months was also lower for intervention patients than for controls (4.6\% v 8.3\%; odds ratio 0.54, 0.39 to 0.75, P {\textless} 0.001). These differences in admissions and mortality remained significant after adjustment. The mean number of emergency admissions per head also differed between groups (crude rates, intervention 0.54 v control 0.68); these changes were significant in unadjusted comparisons (incidence rate ratio 0.81, 0.65 to 1.00, P = 0.046) and after adjusting for a predictive risk score, but not after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Length of hospital stay was shorter for intervention patients than for controls (mean bed days per head 4.87 v 5.68; geometric mean difference -0.64 days, -1.14 to -0.10, P = 0.023, which remained significant after adjustment). Observed differences in other forms of hospital use, including notional costs, were not significant in general. Differences in emergency admissions were greatest at the beginning of the trial, during which we observed a particularly large increase for the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth is associated with lower mortality and emergency admission rates. The reasons for the short term increases in admissions for the control group are not clear, but the trial recruitment processes could have had an effect.

OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the economic burden of four main heart conditions in Brazil: hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine and structured telephone support for the management of heart failure was assessed.
METHODS: A standard cost of illness framework was used to assess the costs associated with the four conditions in 2015. The analysis assessed the prevalence of the four conditions and, in the case of myocardial infarction, also its incidence. It further assessed the conditions' associated expenditures on healthcare treatment, productivity losses from reduced employment, costs of providing formal and informal care, and lost wellbeing. The analysis was informed by a targeted literature review, data scan and modelling. All inputs and methods were validated by consulting 15 clinicians and other stakeholders in Brazil. The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on a meta-analysis and economic evaluation of post-discharge programs in patients with heart failure, assessed from the perspective of the Brazilian Unified Healthcare System (Sistema Unico de Saude).
RESULTS: Myocardial infarction imposes the greatest financial cost (22.4 billion reais/6.9 billion USD), followed by heart failure (22.1 billion reais/6.8 billion USD), hypertension (8 billion reais/2.5 billion USD) and, finally, atrial fibrillation (3.9 billion reais/1.2 billion USD). Telemedicine and structured telephone support are cost-effective interventions for achieving improvements in the management of heart failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Heart conditions impose substantial loss of wellbeing and financial costs in Brazil and should be a public health priority.},

METHODS: We conducted a multi-method study: a pragmatic cluster randomized stepped-wedge trial, ethnographic observation and in-depth interviews, and an economic evaluation. Long term care facilities (clusters) were randomly allocated to start dates of the intervention. An advance practice nurse (APN) with expertise in skin and wound care visited intervention facilities to educate staff on pressure ulcer prevention and treatment, supported by an off-site hospital based expert multi-disciplinary wound care team via email, telephone, or video link as needed. The primary outcome was rate of reduction in pressure ulcer surface area (cm2/day) measured on before and after standard photographs by an assessor blinded to facility allocation. Secondary outcomes were time to healing, probability of healing, pressure ulcer incidence, pressure ulcer prevalence, wound pain, hospitalization, emergency department visits, utility, and cost.
RESULTS: 12 of 15 eligible LTC facilities were randomly selected to participate and randomized to start date of the intervention following the stepped wedge design. 137 residents with a total of 259 pressure ulcers (stage 2 or greater) were recruited over the 17 month study period. No statistically significant differences were found between control and intervention periods on any of the primary or secondary outcomes. The economic evaluation demonstrated a mean reduction in direct care costs of \$650 per resident compared to 'usual care'. The qualitative study suggested that onsite support by APN wound specialists was welcomed, and is responsible for reduced costs through discontinuation of expensive non evidence based treatments. Insufficient allocation of nursing home staff time to wound care may explain the lack of impact on healing.
CONCLUSION: Enhanced multi-disciplinary wound care teams were cost effective, with most benefit through cost reduction initiated by APNs, but did not improve the treatment of pressure ulcers in nursing homes. Policy makers should consider the potential yield of strengthening evidence based primary care within LTC facilities, through outreach by APNs.

	abstract = {The development of hearing diagnosis methods and hearing screening methods are not isolated phenomena: they are intimately related to changes in the cultural background and to advances in fields of medicine and engineering. In the recent years, there has been a rapid evolution in the development of fast, easy and reliable techniques for low-cost hearing screening initiatives. Since adults and elderly people typically experience a reduced hearing ability in challenging listening situations [e.g., in background noise, in reverberation, or with competing speech (Pichora-Fuller \& Souza, 2003)], these newly developed screening tests mainly rely on the recognition of speech stimuli in noise, so that the real experienced listening difficulties can be effectively targeted (Killion \& Niquette, 2000). New tests based on the recognition of speech in noise are being developed on portable, battery-operated devices (see, for example, Paglialonga et al., 2011), or distributed diffusely using information and communication technologies. The evolutions of e-Health and telemedicine have shifted focus from patients coming to the hearing clinic for hearing health evaluation towards the possibility of evaluating the hearing status remotely at home. So far, two ways of distributing the hearing test have primarily been used: ordinary telephone networks (excluding mobile networks) and the internet. When using the telephone network for hearing screening, the predominantly test is a speech-in-noise test often referred to as the digit triplet test where the subjects hearing status is evaluated as the speech-to-noise threshold for spoken digits. This test is today available in some ten countries in Europe, North America and Australia. The use of internet as testing platform allows several different types of hearing assessment tests such as questionnaires, different types of speech in noise tests, temporal gap detection, sound localization (minimum audible angle), and spectral (un)masking tests. Also, the use of the internet allows audiovisual presentations as well as visual interaction and cues in the tests for a more ecological approach. Even if several new and novel approaches for hearing assessment using the internet are surfacing, the validated tests are based on questionnaires or speech-in-noise. Although the internet allows for a broader flora of pure auditory and audiovisual tests for hearing health assessment, calibration problems such as timing uncertainty, output levels and modes of presentation (speakers or earphones) limits the usability at present.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is the most expensive chronic disease in the United States. Two-thirds of US adults have prediabetes or are overweight and at risk for type 2 diabetes. Intensive in-person behavioral counseling can help patients lose weight and make healthy behavior changes to improve their health outcomes. However, with the shortage of health care providers and associated costs, such programs do not adequately service all patients who could benefit. The health care system needs effective and cost-effective interventions that can lead to positive health outcomes as scale. This study investigated the ability of conversational artificial intelligence (AI), in the form of a standalone, fully automated text-based mobile coaching service, to promote weight loss and other health behaviors related to diabetes prevention. This study also measured user acceptability of AI coaches as alternatives to live health care professionals.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate weight loss, changes in meal quality, and app acceptability among users of the Lark Weight Loss Health Coach AI (HCAI), with the overarching goal of increasing access to compassionate health care via mobile health. Lessons learned in this study can be applied when planning future clinical trials to evaluate HCAI and when designing AI to promote weight loss, healthy behavior change, and prevention and self-management of chronic diseases.
METHODS: This was a longitudinal observational study among overweight and obese (body mass index ≥25) participants who used HCAI, which encourages weight loss and healthy diet choices through elements of cognitive behavioral therapy. Weight loss, meal quality, physical activity, and sleep data were collected through user input and, for sleep and physical activity, partly through automatic detection by the user's mobile phone. User engagement was assessed by duration and amount of app use. A 4-question in-app user trust survey assessed app usability and acceptability.
RESULTS: Data were analyzed for participants (N=70) who met engagement standards set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for Diabetes Prevention Program, a clinically proven weight loss program focused on preventing diabetes. Weight loss (standard error of the mean) was 2.38\% (0.69\%) of baseline weight. The average duration of app use was 15 (SD 1.0) weeks, and users averaged 103 sessions each. Predictors of weight loss included duration of AI use, number of counseling sessions, and number of meals logged. Percentage of healthy meals increased by 31\%. The in-app user trust survey had a 100\% response rate and positive results, with a satisfaction score of 87 out of 100 and net promoter score of 47.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that use of an AI health coach is associated with weight loss comparable to in-person lifestyle interventions. It can also encourage behavior changes and have high user acceptability. Research into AI and its application in telemedicine should be pursued, with clinical trials investigating effects on weight, health behaviors, and user engagement and acceptability.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We tested the efficacy of a remote tailored intervention Tele-Cancer Risk Assessment and Evaluation (TeleCARE) compared with a mailed educational brochure for improving colonoscopy uptake among at-risk relatives of colorectal cancer patients and examined subgroup differences based on participant reported cost barriers.
METHODS: Family members of colorectal cancer patients who were not up-to-date with colonoscopy were randomly assigned as family units to TeleCARE (N = 232) or an educational brochure (N = 249). At the 9-month follow-up, a cost resource letter listing resources for free or reduced-cost colonoscopy was mailed to participants who had reported cost barriers and remained nonadherent. Rates of medically verified colonoscopy at the 15-month follow-up were compared on the basis of group assignment and within group stratification by cost barriers.
RESULTS: In intent-to-treat analysis, 42.7\% of participants in TeleCARE and 24.1\% of participants in the educational brochure group had a medically verified colonoscopy [OR, 2.37; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.59-3.52]. Cost was identified as a barrier in both groups (TeleCARE = 62.5\%; educational brochure = 57.0\%). When cost was not a barrier, the TeleCARE group was almost four times as likely as the comparison to have a colonoscopy (OR, 3.66; 95\% CI, 1.85-7.24). The intervention was efficacious among those who reported cost barriers; the TeleCARE group was nearly twice as likely to have a colonoscopy (OR, 1.99; 95\% CI, 1.12-3.52).
CONCLUSIONS: TeleCARE increased colonoscopy regardless of cost barriers.
IMPACT: Remote interventions may bolster screening colonoscopy regardless of cost barriers and be more efficacious when cost barriers are absent.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study examined the differential impact of two telehealth programs for women caring for an older adult with a neurocognitive disorder. Outcomes examined were depressive symptoms, upset following disruptive behaviors, anxious and angry mood states, and caregiving self-efficacy.
METHODS: Women cohabitating with a family member diagnosed with a neurocognitive disorder were assigned via random allocation to either of the following: (1) a 14-week behavioral intervention using video instructional materials, workbook and telephone coaching in behavioral management, pleasant events scheduling, and relaxation or (2) a basic education guide and telephone support comparison condition. Telephone assessments were conducted by interviewers blind to treatment condition at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 6 months following intervention.
RESULTS: For those providing in-home care at post-treatment, depressive symptoms, upset following disruptive behaviors, and negative mood states were statistically lower in the behavioral coaching condition than in the basic education and support condition. Reliable change index analyses for Beck Depression Inventory II scores favored the behavioral coaching condition. Caregiving self-efficacy scores for obtaining respite and for managing patient behavioral disturbances were significantly higher in the coaching condition. Effect sizes were moderate but not maintained at the 6-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some initial evidence for the efficacy of a telehealth behavioral coaching intervention compared with basic education and telephone support. Carers' abilities to maintain strategy use during progressive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease likely require longer intervention contact than provided in the current study. Dementia carers, including those living in rural areas, can benefit from accessible and empirically supported interventions that can be easily disseminated across distances at modest cost.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health policy makers have recently shifted attention towards examining high users of health care, in particular patients with complex chronic disease and disability (CCDD) characterized as having multimorbidities and care needs that require ongoing use of services. The adoption of eHealth technologies may be a key strategy in supporting and providing care for these patients; however, these technologies need to address the specific needs of patients with CCDD. This paper describes the first phase of a multiphased patient-centered research project aimed at developing eHealth technology for patients with CCDD.
OBJECTIVE: As part of the development of new eHealth technologies to support patients with CCDD in primary care settings, we sought to determine the perceived needs of these patients with respect to (1) the kinds of health and health service issues that are important to them, (2) the information that should be collected and how it could be collected in order to help meet their needs, and (3) their views on the challenges/barriers to using eHealth mobile apps to collect the information.
METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with community-dwelling patients with CCDD and caregivers. An interpretive description research design was used to identify the perceived needs of participants and the information sharing and eHealth technologies that could support those needs. Analysis was conducted concurrently with data collection. Coding of transcripts from four focus groups was conducted by 3 authors. QSR NVivo 10 software was used to manage coding.
RESULTS: There were 14 total participants in the focus groups. The average age of participants was 64.4 years; 9 participants were female, and 11 were born in Canada. Participants identified a need for open two-way communication and dialogue between themselves and their providers, and better information sharing between providers in order to support continuity and coordination of care. Access issues were mainly around wait times for appointments, challenges with transportation, and costs. A visual depiction of these perceived needs and their relation to each other is included as part of the discussion, which will be used to guide development of our eHealth technologies. Participants recognized the potential for eHealth technologies to support and improve their care but also expressed common concerns regarding their adoption. Specifically, they mentioned privacy and data security, accessibility, the loss of necessary visits, increased social isolation, provider burden, downloading responsibility onto patients for care management, entry errors, training requirements, and potentially confusing interfaces.
CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of our participants, there is a significant potential for eHealth tools to support patients with CCDD in community and primary care settings, but we need to be wary of the potential downfalls of adopting eHealth technologies and pay special attention to patient-identified needs and concerns. eHealth tools that support ongoing patient-provider interaction, patient self-management (such as telemonitoring), and provider-provider interactions (through electronic health record integration) could be of most benefit to patients similar to those in our study.},

	abstract = {Introduction The number of patients needing care who suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is expected to increase in the future. The consequences thereof will increase the socio-economic burden for both patients and society. Telehealthcare technologies have shown potential in reducing hospitalisation-related costs and in improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for some COPD patients, but not all. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of predictive algorithms for helping the general practitioner to stratify telehealthcare for COPD patients in a way that maximises HRQOL and minimises COPD-related costs. Methods Data from 553 COPD patients based in the North Denmark Region were analysed and used as predictors for four multiple linear regression models. The models were trained and evaluated for their abilities to predict individual patient's future health- and cost-related developments, with and without telehealthcare. Results The average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the health and cost models was 5.265 HRQOL scores and US dollars (US\$)5430.49, respectively. The accuracy regarding the polarity of the predicted changes ranged from 61-65\% for the health models and 74-75\% for the cost models. While differences in the magnitude of predictions with and without telehealthcare were statistically significant ( p {\textless} 0.01), the polarity of predictions was similar across models in 82.05\% of all cases. Discussion Our results indicate that it may be possible to predict the magnitude and polarity of a COPD patient's future health- and cost-related developments with and without telehealthcare. Predictive algorithms may provide a useful decision support tool in stratifying telehealthcare for COPD patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Telerehabilitation is one of the newest branches of telemedicine which has been developed because patients need regular trainings outside the medical institution but still under specialist supervision. It helps maintain regularity of exercises and reduces costs. The professional and advanced systems for telerehabilitation are presented in papers, however, there is still lack of development of minor systems which provide therapeutic values and are more accessible to people. Therefore we focus on a solution for hand telerehabilitation of poststroke patients, based solely on a personal computer and camera.
METHODS: We focused on the manipulative hand (fingers, metacarpus, wrist) movements trainings for patients with cerebral palsy. The contact between patient and physiotherapist is provided by using web cameras and web service. Additionally, the camera can be used to monitor the effectiveness of performed exercises. Computer vision system keeps track of the patient's hand movement. The digital image processing is used to detect if the patient performs exercises correctly.
RESULTS: We created web service and software application TeleReh that provides therapeutic values for the hand impaired people. The system created was evaluated by three physiotherapists, one doctor and a cerebral palsy patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Our solution applies to all patients who have undergone basic rehabilitation in hospital and need to continue hand rehabilitation at home. The main advantages are: easy adaptation to the individual needs and abilities, monitoring the progress by using automatically generated reports after each training session. It is worth noticing that discussion between IT specialists, rehabilitants and patients was necessary to achieve good results.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To develop, implement and evaluate a telemedicine model to reduce glaucoma blindness through the early detection of undiagnosed glaucoma in high-risk individuals.
DESIGN: Prospective study, private ophthalmology practice and public outpatient clinics in Tasmania.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and thirty-three individuals with primary open-angle glaucoma were invited to enrol their first-degree relatives (FDRs) to undergo an eye examination. Within the study period, 211 FDRs were available for examination.
METHODS: A registered nurse was trained to perform the required assessments. Clinical data were entered into a purpose-built database, converted to a portable document format and graded offsite by an ophthalmologist to determine the presence, absence or risk of developing glaucoma. Participants were notified of the grading result and recommendations for review.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of undiagnosed glaucoma in a high-risk population.
RESULTS: Previously undiagnosed glaucoma was identified in 5\% of those examined. For every 19 participants screened, one new case of previously undiagnosed case of glaucoma was identified. Additionally 15\% of participants showed suspicious signs of glaucoma, and 6\% had ocular hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: A telemedicine model is an efficient method for screening, grading and notifying participants of examination results. Nurses can be adequately trained to undertake the initial screening examinations, with grading of the results performed offsite by a suitably qualified ophthalmologist. Targeted screening for glaucoma increases the yield of identifying individuals with undiagnosed glaucoma or those at greatest risk. Cost efficiencies for this model of glaucoma screening should be further explored and implemented to prevent blindness from familial glaucoma.},

Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the impact of telehealth on 197 heart failure patients who had successfully completed one year of home telehealth monitoring following a heart failure admission as part of a clinically mandated programme at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Outcomes were compared both within the group (one year before and one year after home telehealth monitoring), and to a contemporary control cohort of 870 heart failure patients who were admitted but not enrolled in home telehealth. The following outcomes were analysed: admissions for any cause, heart failure admissions, total hospital days per patient, average length of stay per admission, urgent care and emergency room visits, and primary care visits. Results Both the home telehealth and control cohorts consisted of older male patients. Total hospital days per patient was significantly reduced by home telehealth monitoring in the home telehealth group (2.4 ± 3.5) in comparison to the previous year without monitoring (4.1 ± 4.6, p {\textless} 0.0001) and to the control group (3.8 ± 5.3, p {\textless} 0.001). A significantly lower admission rate (1.1 ± 1.6) and length of stay (5.7 ± 11.3 days) were observed during home telehealth monitoring within the home telehealth group compared to the prior year (1.6 ± 1.7, p {\textless} 0.05 and 9.5 ± 14 days, p {\textless} 0.01 respectively) but not in comparison with the control group (1.4 ± 2.0, p {\textless} 0.07). The home telehealth group also had a significantly lower length of stay when compared to the control group (5.7 ± 11.3 vs 9.0 ± 14.9, p {\textless} 0.01). The number of urgent care and emergency room visits, or primary care visits, was not significantly different during home telehealth monitoring as compared to the prior year.

IBD Standards (Revised 2013) recommend telephone advice for patients with regard to symptoms and medication management. This report attempts to quantify the net financial impact of this service at our hospital since it was introduced in August 2013.
METHOD: The Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley (National Health Service, Greater Glasgow and Clyde) is a district general hospital with a catchment population of 200 000 with approximately 2500 patients with IBD. Data relating to the use of the IBD telemedicine service were prospectively recorded on a daily basis for a period of 5 months. We documented reasons for calling and the likely action taken by the patient had the telephone advice line not been available. Cost savings based on alternative outcomes were made in accordance with the Department of Health figures (Department of Health reference costs 2011-2012).
RESULTS: The mean number of calls per month was 88 (IQR 24)-(the mean number of calls which were deemed non-IBD issues was 30 calls per month (IQR 8.0)) The mean cost of staffing the IBD advice line with an IBD clinical nurse specialist was £482.00 per month (IQR 195.5). The mean time spent on calls per month was 28.5 h (IQR 11.5). Cost savings over 5 months for avoidance of general practitioner (GP) consultation was £3408.00. Savings for avoidance of a consultant appointment made over the 5-month period was £27 454.00. Savings made from patients avoiding either an accident and emergency (A\&E) or a hospital admission were £540.00 and £11 488.00, respectively, over the 5-month period. The net saving was £42 890.00.
CONCLUSIONS: A nurse-led telephone advice line appears to be a cost-effective intervention. It may prevent patients from unnecessary hospital attendance. Savings can be made to both primary care and secondary care. Overall, it appears that the advice line is providing a highly valuable service not just in terms of accessible treatment decisions and guidance for patients, but cost savings when IBD clinic nurse specialist time is compared with that of GPs, consultants or hospital facilities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: mHealth interventions can help to improve the physical well-being of participants. Unfortunately, mHealth interventions often have low adherence and high attrition. One possible way to increase adherence is instructing participants to complete self-affirmation exercises. Self-affirmation exercises have been effective in increasing many types of positive behaviors. However, self-affirmation exercises often involve extensive essay writing, a task that is not easy to complete on mobile platforms.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to adapt a self-affirmation exercise to a form better suited for delivery through a mobile app targeting healthy eating behaviors, and to test the effect of differing self-affirmation doses on adherence to behavior change goals over time.
METHODS: We examined how varied self-affirmation doses affected behavior change in an mHealth app targeting healthy eating that participants used for 28 days. We divided participants into the 4 total conditions using a 2×2 factorial design. The first independent variable was whether the participant received an initial self-affirmation exercise. The second independent variable was whether the participant received ongoing booster self-affirmations throughout the 28-day study. To examine possible mechanisms through which self-affirmation may cause positive behavior change, we analyzed three aspects of self-affirmation effects in our research. First, we analyzed how adherence was affected by self-affirmation exercises. Second, we analyzed whether self-affirmation exercises reduced attrition rates from the app. Third, we examined a model for self-affirmation behavior change.
RESULTS: Analysis of 3556 observations from 127 participants indicated that higher doses of self-affirmation resulted in improved adherence to mHealth intervention goals (coefficient 1.42, SE 0.71, P=.04). This increased adherence did not seem to translate to a decrease in participant attrition (P value range .61-.96), although our definition of attrition was conservative. Finally, we examined the mechanisms by which self-affirmation may have affected intentions of behavior change; we built a model of intention (R2=.39, P{\textless}.001), but self-affirmation did not directly affect final intentions (P value range .09-.93).
CONCLUSIONS: Self-affirmations can successfully increase adherence to recommended diet and health goals in the context of an mHealth app. However, this increase in adherence does not seem to reduce overall attrition. The self-affirmation exercises we developed were simple to implement and had a low cost for both users and developers. While this study focused on an mHealth app for healthy eating, we recommend that other mHealth apps integrate similar self-affirmation exercises to examine effectiveness in other behaviors and contexts.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: 'Store and forward' teledermoscopy is a technology with potential advantages for melanoma screening. Any large-scale implementation of this technology is dependent on consumer acceptance.
AIM: To investigate preferences for melanoma screening options compared with skin self-examination in adults considered to be at increased risk of developing skin cancer.
METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was completed by 35 consumers, all of whom had prior experience with the use of teledermoscopy, in Queensland, Australia. Participants made 12 choices between screening alternatives described by seven attributes including monetary cost. A mixed logit model was used to estimate the relative weights that consumers place on different aspects of screening, along with the marginal willingness to pay for teledermoscopy as opposed to screening at a clinic.
RESULTS: Overall, participants preferred screening/diagnosis by a health professional rather than skin self-examination. Key drivers of screening choice were for results to be reviewed by a dermatologist; a higher detection rate; fewer non-cancerous moles being removed in relation to every skin cancer detected; and less time spent away from usual activities. On average, participants were willing to pay AUD110 to have teledermoscopy with dermatologist review available to them as a screening option.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Consumers preferentially value aspects of care that are more feasible with a teledermoscopy screening model, as compared with other skin cancer screening and diagnosis options. This study adds to previous literature in the area which has relied on the use of consumer satisfaction scales to assess the acceptability of teledermoscopy.},

Telephone assessment during labor, the current norm in many settings, has been found to be a source of dissatisfaction for women and can present challenges for midwives. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore midwives' views on the potential of video-calling as a method for assessing women in early labor.
METHODS: A series of 8 midwife focus groups (n = 45) and interviews (n = 4) in the Midlands region of England and the mid-South and Northeast regions of the United States were completed. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and coded using content analysis. Coding diagrams were used to help develop major themes in the data.
RESULTS: Midwives were generally positive about the potential of video-calling in early labor and using visual cues to make more accurate assessments and to enhance trust. Some midwives expressed concerns about privacy, both for themselves and for women, and issues of accessibility. They suggested strategies for implementation and further research, such as the need for a private space in birth facilities and training for both staff and service users.
CONCLUSIONS: Video-calling was seen as a viable option for assessment of women in early labor with some particular challenges related to implementation. This research focused on midwives' views; the views of women and their families should also be considered. There is a lack of evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of video-calling in maternity care and further research is warranted.},

We hypothesized that the combination of our existing dynamic nonrobotic system with a tablet PC could provide a novel and cost-efficient method to remotely diagnose dermatopathology cases. 93 cases diagnosed by conventional light microscopy at least 5 months earlier by the participating dermatopathologist were retrieved by an electronic pathology database search. A high-resolution video camera (Nikon DS-L2, version 4.4) mounted on a microscope was used to transmit digital video of a slide to an Apple iPAD2 (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA) at the pathologist's remote location via live streaming at an interval time of 500 ms and a resolution of 1280/960 pixels. Concordance to the original diagnosis and the seconds elapsed to reaching the diagnosis were recorded. 24.7\% (23/93) of cases were melanocytic, 70.9\% (66/93) were nonmelanocytic, and 4.4\% (4/93) were inflammatory. About 92.5\% (86/93) of cases were diagnosed on immediate viewing ({\textless}5 seconds), with the average time to diagnosis at 40.2 seconds (range: 10-218 seconds). Of the cases diagnosed immediately, 98.8\% (85/86) of the telediagnoses were concordant with the original. Telepathology performed via a tablet PC may serve as a reliable and rapid technique for the diagnosis of routine cases with some diagnostic caveats in mind. Our study established a novel and cost-efficient solution for those institutions that may not have the capital to purchase either a dynamic robotic system or a virtual slide system.},

	abstract = {Telehealth possesses a significant potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery processes by challenging some of the long-held assumptions about healthcare delivery and by creating innovative alternative models. Those assumptions relate to the location-linked nature of healthcare and its episodic nature. Telehealth can challenge the assumption that healthcare is inextricably linked to the provider's location. Numerous models involving such approaches as interactive videoconferencing and store-and-forward technologies already exist. Telehealth also challenges the episodic nature of care. One example is provided by the models evolving from the convergence of three technologies: remote monitoring, electronic health records, and clinical decision support systems. Telehealth-based models of care can also lead to a reduced demand for services and greater efficiencies in the care process. These telehealth-enabled care delivery models have the potential to reduce the costs of care, improve quality, and mitigate provider shortages. However, the achievement of these goals is not straightforward. The current healthcare financing system is not designed to support such new models, and the existing healthcare culture is deeply ingrained within workflow processes and provider attitudes. A great deal of work remains to be done before the benefits of telehealth-based care delivery models are fully realized. Change is inherently risky but we must have the courage to assume the risk in order to create telehealth-driven innovations that lead to better and more cost-effective medical care for all.},

For 15 years, the University of Kansas Center for Telemedicine and Telehealth has been providing telemental health outreach from the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). One service site is located in Crawford County, Kansas, which provides telepsychiatry services to children and adolescents. The purpose of this study was to examine the costs of operating the Crawford County site relative to accessing services at KUMC, the likely alternative service location. The cost of travel time to parents who accompanied a dependent to either location also was estimated. Patients and parents were examined over a 6-month period in 2006. One hundred thirty-two patients received 257 telemedicine psychiatric consultations during this period. Cost estimates for using the pediatric telemedicine service were assessed for all patients; however, travel and related costs were collected from a sample of 26 patient-parent dyads. The estimated costs of services were obtained using standard cost-accounting procedures. An average cost per consultation in Crawford County was \$168.61. The cost savings in travel time and other expenses to parents and patients were substantial between use of the county site and KUMC. Subtracting average savings in travel costs to patients and parents produced an average cost of a telepsychiatry consult in Crawford County of only \$30.99. This study was conducted over 6 months with a small number of observations; it should be replicated over a longer study period, with more patients, and with more data that might capture marginal costs of services.},

These programs have typically been provided in clinical facilities, health clubs, and senior centers, which may be inconvenient and/or cost prohibitive for some older adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an automated telemedicine intervention that provides real-time guidance and monitoring of resistance training in the home.
METHODS: A randomized clinical trial in 103 middle-aged or older participants. Participants were assigned to use of a theory-driven interactive voice response system designed to promote resistance training (Telephone-Linked Computer-based Long-term Interactive Fitness Trainer; n = 52) or to an attention control (n = 51) for a period of 12 months. Measurements of muscle strength, balance, walk distance, and mood were obtained at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months.
RESULTS: We observed increased strength, improved balance, and fewer depressive symptoms in the intervention group than in the control group. Using generalized estimating equations modeling, group differences were statistically significant for knee flexion strength (p = .035), single-leg stance time (p = .029), and Beck Depression Inventory (p = .030).
CONCLUSIONS: This computer-based telecommunications exercise intervention led to improvements in participants' strength, balance, and depressive symptoms. Because of their low cost and easy accessibility, computer-based interventions may be a cost-effective way of promoting exercise in the home.},

Patients may be discharged from the hospital before receiving an evaluation or boarded in a hospital bed for observation, reducing quality and increasing costs. This study examined the effectiveness of an emergency telemental health evaluation service implemented in a rural hospital emergency room.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective data collection was implemented to consider patients presenting to the emergency room for 212 days prior to telemedicine interventions and for 184 days after. The study compared measures of time to treatment, length of stay (regardless of inpatient or outpatient status), and door-to-consult time.
RESULTS: There were 24 patients seen before telemedicine was implemented and 38 seen using telemedicine. All patients had a mental health evaluation ordered by a physician and completed by a mental health specialist. Significant reductions in all three time measures were observed. Mean and median times to consult were reduced from 16.2 h (standard deviation=13.2 h) and 14.2 h, respectively, to 5.4 h (standard deviation =6.4 h) and 2.6 h. Similar reductions in length of stay and door-to-consult times were observed. By t tests, use of telemedicine was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all three outcome measures.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Brazil, the majority of healthcare resources are concentrated in the largest cities, whereas most communities lack proper healthcare assistance in primary care and have difficulties accessing specialists and diagnostic examinations. Considering this, the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG) was created. It is a public telehealth initiative that provides support to primary healthcare (PHC), performing teleconsultation and telediagnosis (electrocardiogram [ECG], Holter, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, spirometry, and retinography analysis) mainly for small and remote cities in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil.
PURPOSE: To describe the successful experience of the TNMG in 10 years of activities.
METHODS: The TNMG was created in 2005 and supported PHC in 82 cities as a research project and was progressively expanded. A methodology for implementation and maintenance was developed, including quality control. Nowadays it provides support to 750 cities, 88.0\% of Minas Gerais state. The examinations performed by the PHC team, with additional basic clinical data, are transmitted through the Internet to the TNMG specialists for remote interpretation. The TNMG teleconsultations system has been used by the PHC team to address written clinical questions to university staff.
RESULTS: Until December 2015, 2,464,999 ECGs and 73,698 teleconsultations have already been performed: on average, 2,000 ECGs and 40 teleconsultations per day in 2015. More than 95\% of users have declared to be satisfied or very satisfied with the service. A recent cost-benefit analysis of the project showed that for each dollar invested, 6.1 dollars are saved as a consequence of patient referral reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: The TNMG is a successful example of a sustainable telehealth service, integrated to primary care centers of remote and small cities. It overcomes geographical barriers to provide specialized healthcare, reducing the number of unnecessary referrals, and contributing to improve the case-resolving capacity and the quality of the PHC.},

METHODS: PROMETE II was a multicentre, randomized, 12-month trial. Severe COPD patients in stable condition were randomized to a specific monitoring protocol with TH or routine clinical practice (RCP). The primary objective was to reduce the number of COPD exacerbations leading to ER visits/hospital admissions between groups.
RESULTS: Overall, 237 COPD patients were screened, and 229 (96.6\%) were randomized to TH (n = 115) or RCP (n = 114), with age of 71 ± 8 years and 80\% were men. Overall, 169 completed the full follow-up period. There were no statistical differences at one year between groups in the proportion of participants who had a COPD exacerbation (60\% in TH vs. 53.5\% in RCP; p = 0.321). There was, however, a marked but non-significant trend towards a shorter duration of hospitalization and days in ICU in the TH group (18.9 ± 16.0 and 6.0 ± 4.6 days) compared to the RCP group (22.4 ± 19.5 and 13.3 ± 11.1 days). The number of all-cause deaths was comparable between groups (12 in TH vs. 13 in RCP) as was total resource utilization cost (7912€ in TH vs. 8918€ in RCP). Telehealth was evaluated highly positively by patients and doctors.

	abstract = {In Europe, telecare is the use of remote monitoring technology to enable vulnerable people to live independently in their own homes. The technology includes electronic tags and sensors that transmit information about the user's location and patterns of behavior in the user's home to an external hub, where it can trigger an intervention in an emergency. Telecare users in the United Kingdom sometimes report their unease about being monitored by a "Big Brother," and the same kind of electronic tags that alert telecare hubs to the movements of someone with dementia who is "wandering" are worn by terrorist suspects who have been placed under house arrest. For these and other reasons, such as ordinary privacy concerns, telecare is sometimes regarded as an objectionable extension of a "surveillance state." In this article, we defend the use of telecare against the charge that it is Orwellian. In the United States, the conception of telecare primarily as telemedicine, and the fact that it is not typically a government responsibility, make a supposed connection with a surveillance state even more doubtful than in Europe. The main objection, we argue, to telecare is not its intrusiveness, but the danger of its deepening the isolation of those who use it. There are ways of organizing telecare so that the independence and privacy of users are enhanced, but personal isolation may be harder to address. As telecare is a means of reducing the cost of publicly provided social and health care, and the need to reduce public spending is growing, the correlative problem of isolation must be addressed alongside the goal of promoting independence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient noncompliance with therapy, treatments, and appointments represents a significant barrier to improving health care delivery and reducing the cost of care. One method to improve therapeutic adherence is to improve feedback loops in getting clinically acute events and issues to the relevant clinical providers as necessary (ranging from detecting hypoglycemic events for patients with diabetes to notifying the provider when patients are out of medications). Patients often don't know which information should prompt a call to their physician and proactive checks by the clinics themselves can be very resource intensive. We hypothesized that a two-way SMS system combined with a platform web service for providers would enable both high patient engagement but also the ability to detect relevant clinical alerts.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to develop a feasible two-way automated SMS/phone call + web service platform for patient-provider communication, and then study the feasibility and acceptability of the Epharmix platform. First, we report utilization rates over the course of the first 18 months of operation including total identified clinically significant events, and second, review results of patient user-satisfaction surveys for interventions for patients with diabetes, COPD, congestive heart failure, hypertension, surgical site infections, and breastfeeding difficulties.
METHODS: To test this question, we developed a web service + SMS/phone infrastructure ("Epharmix"). Utilization results were measured based on the total number of text messages or calls sent and received, with percentage engagement defined as a patient responding to a text message at least once in a given week, including the number of clinically significant alerts generated. User satisfaction surveys were sent once per month over the 18 months to measure satisfaction with the system, frequency and degree of communication. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the above information.
RESULTS: In total, 28,386 text messages and 24,017 calls were sent to 929 patients over 9 months. Patients responded to 80\% to 90\% of messages allowing the system to detect 1164 clinically significant events. Patients reported increased satisfaction and communication with their provider. Epharmix increased the number of patient-provider interactions to over 10 on average in any given month for patients with diabetes, COPD, congestive heart failure, hypertension, surgical site infections, and breastfeeding difficulties.
CONCLUSIONS: Engaging high-risk patients remains a difficult process that may be improved through novel, digital health interventions. The Epharmix platform enables increased patient engagement with very low risk to improve clinical outcomes. We demonstrated that engagement among high-risk populations is possible when health care comes conveniently to where they are.},

The aims of TM are to provide services that cannot easily be provided face-to-face and improve the efficiency of existing ones. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease characterized by a heterogeneous array of symptoms that can lead to severe impairment and may impact on accessibility to medical services, patient's ability to function, and overall health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The use of TM to clinically monitor MS patients has demonstrated benefits by improving HRQoL and reducing associated medical costs. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures have been used in TM interventions, registries, and cost-efficiency studies because they offer valuable information about patient's perspective of MS disease burden. Moreover, TM has shown acceptable reliability in the assessment of the neurological impairment by Kurtzke expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and has the potential to develop more sensitive measures, such as average daily walking activity, to closely monitor MS disease progression in real environment. It is likely that the use of TM will continue to increase in the following years but larger and controlled studies are necessary to confirm the beneficial effects of TM to deliver an optimal care for patients with MS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Technology is likely to transform the way care is delivered at home and in the community. Telemedicine, the child of IT and Medicine sciences is the use of telecommunication equipment and information technology to provide clinical care to individuals at distant sites and the transmission of medical and surgical information and images needed to provide that care. Undoubtedly, the advantages outweight its disadvantages, but just like any other innovations, it has some drawbacks. The present study outlines telemedicine strong and weak points. In this regard a survey has been done in Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran.
METHODS: Between 14(th) May and 14(th) August 2012, 90 medical specialist men and 42 women from different hospitals of Tehran Medical Sciences University, Iran were enrolled by a simple ran- dom sampling method. They all completed a questionnaire to consider what are telemedicine chances and challenges.
RESULTS: Making use of telemedicine was a profitable alternative in remote, rural/urban places especially in new project of "family physician" presented by Iran Ministry of Health. The results also highlighted that security considerations was an inevitable challenge of telemedicine, while shorter hospital stays and reduced warm ischemic time, and reduced morbidity and mortality rates were telemedicine merits. Despite most previous studies results, telemedicine has been recognised as a cost-effective alternative. Cultural, language distinctions as well as the level of literacy were barriers on deploying tele- medicine. There was no strong evidence showing that using telemedicine caused a decrease in tactile feedback.
CONCLUSION: We need to fully understand and consider various outcomes and challenges of telemedicine before applying it.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rural areas and refugee camps are characterized by poor access of patients to needed noncommunicable disease (NCD)-related health services, including diabetes and hypertension. Employing low-cost innovative eHealth interventions, such as mobile health (mHealth), may help improve NCDs prevention and control among disadvantaged populations.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of employing low-cost mHealth tools on the accessibility to health services and improvement of health indicators of individuals with NCDs in rural areas and refugee camps in Lebanon.
METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial study in which centers were allocated randomly into control and intervention sites. The effect of an employed mHealth intervention is assessed through selected quality indicators examined in both control and intervention groups. Sixteen primary health care centers (eight controls, eight interventions) located in rural areas and Palestinian refugee camps across Lebanon were included in this study. Data on diabetic and hypertensive patients-1433 in the intervention group and 926 in the control group-was extracted from patient files in the pre and postintervention periods. The intervention entailed weekly short message service messages, including medical information, importance of compliance, and reminders of appointments or regular physician follow-up. Internationally established care indicators were utilized in this study. Descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics of participants, bivariate analysis, logistic and linear regression were conducted using SPSS (IBM Corp).
RESULTS: Bivariate analysis of quality indicators indicated that the intervention group had a significant increase in blood pressure control (P=.03), as well as a significant decrease in the mean systolic blood pressure (P=.02), mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; P{\textless}.01), and in the proportion of HbA1c poor control (P=.02). Separate regression models controlling for age, gender, and setting showed a 28\% increase in the odds of blood pressure control (P=.05) and a 38\% decrease in the odds of HbA1c poor control (P=.04) among the intervention group in the posttest period. Females were at lower odds of HbA1c poor control (P=.01), and age was statistically associated with annual HbA1c testing (P{\textless}.01). Regression models for mean systolic blood pressure, mean diastolic blood pressure, and mean HbA1c showed that a mean decrease in HbA1c of 0.87\% (P{\textless}.01) pretest to posttest period was observed among the intervention group. Patients in rural areas belonging to the intervention group had a lower HbA1c score as compared with those in refugee camps (P{\textless}.01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study underlines the importance of employing integrative approaches of diseases prevention and control in which existing NCD programs in underserved communities (ie, rural and refugee camps settings) are coupled with innovative, low-cost approaches such as mHealth to provide an effective and amplified effect of traditional NCD-targeted care that can be reflected by improved NCD-related health indicators among the population.

We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of TD in remote areas where medical facilities and consultant dermatologists are not available, through measurement of diagnostic concordance rates between face-to-face diagnosis and store-and-forward (SAF) TD diagnosis. Methods A total of 600 patients with dermatological ailments who attended Abshway Hospital were recruited into the study, examined by an on-site dermatology resident, and offered a diagnosis. The clinical images and patients' history were collected and transferred (through the Dropbox application) to two remote consultant dermatologists. The reliability of the three physicians' agreement rates was assessed. Results Diagnostic agreement rates between the face-to-face dermatologist and the two teledermatologists were 86.7\% and 87\% respectively. Of the cases, 97\% had complete or partial agreement and 81.3\% of cases showed complete agreement between the three physicians. The reliability of the three physicians' agreement rates was assessed statistically using Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) and this showed a range of 0.46-0.52. Conclusion This study might aid in enhancing the utilization of this tool in our country, especially in remote areas with a lack of a proper dermatological service. The simplicity and low cost of the adopted technique might facilitate its use over large sectors. It opens the door for gaining the benefit of this technology in other aspects such as teaching and monitoring health care providers.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicenter, analytical, quasi-experimental, non-randomized clinical study of a SFTMS aimed towards the management of patients with TMJD was conducted at the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Unit of the Virgen Macarena University Hospital (Seville, Spain) and 10 primary care areas of the North area of Seville located between 15 and 180 km from the hospital. The study was carried out between January 2008 and February 2010 including a non-random sample consisting of all patients with TMJD treated at primary care sites during the study period. We describe the development and effectiveness of this method based on the rates of diagnosis of myofascial syndrome and/or internal deragement Wilkes Stages I-II-III, internal deragement Wilkes Stages IV-V, other arthropathies, resolved teleconsultations, second teleconsultations, referrals to hospital, mean treatment delay, lost hours working/patient and complaints. The same variables were also described for the TMJD conventional consultation system at hospital (standard system). Descriptive statistics (frequency tables, means and medians, and dispersion measures), T-Student test was used to compare the differences in the average quantitative variables (time) and Chi2 test was used to compare the differences in the average qualitative variables.
RESULTS: Over a 24-month period, 710 patients with TMJD were assisted at hospital by conventional consultation from 1-1-2008 to 2-25-2010, of which 587 (82.7\%) were women and 123 (17.3\%) were men with a mean age of 41.08 years. The mean time elapsed until treatment onset was 78.6 days, with a mean cost of 32 lost working hours per patient. In this period, 342 patients with TMJD were assisted by teleconsultation, of which 276 (80.7\%) were women and 66 (19.2\%) were men with a mean age of 38.3 years. Only 35 (10\%) patients presented some other TMJ pathology that required maxillofacial surgery. The remaining 307 (89.7\%) received non-surgical treatment in the primary care center (high resolutive consultations) in a mean time of 2.3 days (p{\textless}0.05), and a mean cost of 16 lost working hours/patient (p{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine allows a correct diagnosis and an adequate treatment for the majority of TMJD from primary care sites and shortens the delay in treatment onset, preventing displacement and unnecessary costs for these patients.},

Thus, less expensive alternatives are used. The purpose of this study was to compare three devices for digital capture of X-ray films: a film digitizer (US \$15,000), a flatbed scanner (US \$1800), and a 10-megapixel digital camera (US \$450), in terms of diagnostic accuracy, defined as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves and computed tomography as the gold standard.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample included 136 chest X-ray cases with computed tomography confirmation of the presence or absence of pneumothorax, interstitial opacities, or nodules. The readers were six radiologists who made observations of eight variables for each digital capture of the X-ray films: three main variables to determine the accuracy in the detection of the above-mentioned pathologies, four secondary variables to categorize other pathological classifications, and one variable regarding digital image quality.
RESULTS: The receiver operating characteristic curves for each device and pathology were very similar. For the main variables, there was no significant statistical difference in diagnostic accuracy between the devices. For the secondary variables, {\textgreater}84\% of cases were correctly classified, even those that were classified with the lowest image quality. High accuracy was determined for the three main variables (0.75 to 0.96), indicating good performance for all tested devices, despite their very different prices.
CONCLUSIONS: Choosing a device for a teleradiology service should involve additional factors, such as capture time, maintenance concerns, and training requirements.},

The purpose of this study was to compare three differently priced displays (a medical-grade grayscale display and two consumer-grade color displays) for image visualization of digitized chest X-rays.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The evaluated conditions were interstitial opacities, pneumothorax, and nodules using computed tomography as the gold standard. The comparison was accomplished in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the diagnostic power measured as the area under ROC curves, accuracy in conditions classification, and main factors affecting accuracy, in a factorial study with 76 cases and six radiologists.
RESULTS: The ROC curves for all of the displays and pathologies had similar shapes and no differences in diagnostic power. The proportion of cases correctly classified for each display was greater than 71.9\%. The correctness proportions of the three displays were different (p{\textless}0.05) only for interstitial opacities. The evaluation of the main factors affecting these proportions revealed that the display factor was not significant for either nodule size or pneumothorax size (p{\textgreater}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the image quality variables showed differences in the radiologists' perceptions of the image quality of the three displays, significant differences in the accuracy did not occur. The main effect on the variability of the proportions of correctly classified cases did not come from the display factor. This study confirms previous findings that medical-grade displays could be replaced by consumer-grade color displays with the same image quality.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: While most studies have focused on analyzing the results of telemedicine use, it is crucial to consider the determinants of its use to fully understand the issue. This article aims to provide evidence on the determinants of telemedicine use in clinical practice.
METHODS: The survey targeted a total population of 398 medical professionals from a healthcare institution in Spain. The study sample was formed by the ninety-three primary care physicians who responded. Using an extended Technology Acceptance Model and microdata for the ninety-six physicians, binary logistic regression analysis was carried out.
RESULTS: The analysis performed confirmed the model's goodness-of-fit, which allowed 48.1 percent of the dependent variable's variance to be explained. The outcomes revealed that the physicians at the healthcare institution placed greater importance on telemedicine's potential to reduce costs, and on its usefulness to the medical profession. The perception of medical information security and confidentiality and the patients' predisposition toward telemedicine were the second explanatory factors in order of importance. A third set of moderating effects would appear to corroborate the importance of the physicians' own opinions.
CONCLUSIONS: These results have revealed the need for a dynamic approach to the design of telemedicine use, especially when it targets a variety of end-users. Hence, the importance of conducting studies before using telemedicine, and attempting to identify which of the above-mentioned predictors exert an influence and how.},

These result in a relatively high percentage of images which are later marked as unreadable by graders. Unreadable images require a recapture which is time and cost intensive. An automated method that determines the image quality during acquisition is an effective alternative. To determine the image quality during acquisition, we describe here an automated method for the assessment of image quality in the context of diabetic retinopathy. The method explicitly applies machine learning techniques to access the image and to determine 'accept' and 'reject' categories. 'Reject' category image requires a recapture. A deep convolution neural network is trained to grade the images automatically. A large representative set of 7000 colour fundus images was used for the experiment which was obtained from the EyePACS that were made available by the California Healthcare Foundation. Three retinal image analysis experts were employed to categorise these images into 'accept' and 'reject' classes based on the precise definition of image quality in the context of DR. The network was trained using 3428 images. The method shows an accuracy of 100\% to successfully categorise 'accept' and 'reject' images, which is about 2\% higher than the traditional machine learning method. On a clinical trial, the proposed method shows 97\% agreement with human grader. The method can be easily incorporated with the fundus image capturing system in the acquisition centre and can guide the photographer whether a recapture is necessary or not.},

	doi = {10.4103/psychiatry.IndianJPsychiatry_211_18},
	abstract = {Objective: Addiction is a growing public health problem which affects the person, the whole family, and society. The primary care physician (PCP) is often the first point of contact in the health care and can play a significant role in the early detection and intervention. It is well established that early intervention is associated with better outcomes. In the formal medical training, PCPs receive no formal training on drug addiction management. In this pilot study, we developed an innovative telementoring model and looked at feasibility as well as acceptability among remote PCPs on drug addiction management.
Materials and Methods: The telementoring model consists of both synchronous and asynchronous components. The synchronous component consists of National Institute of Mental Health And Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) academic center Hub and remote district level primary care physician Spokes, and is implemented by using low-cost multipoint videoconference based tele-ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcome) clinics. During the tele-ECHO clinics, held fortnightly, the remote PCPs used Internet-enabled smartphones to connect as well as present the patient case summaries to the multidisciplinary expert team of NIMHANS HUB. The asynchronous component consists of mobile-based ubiquitous e-learning integrated to a course completion certificate. We evaluated this innovative telementoring program on participant engagement, learning, confidence, and satisfaction. A pre-post design and e-learning assignments were used to measure the outcomes.
Results: Of the proposed 21 tele-ECHO clinics, 11 were held till the end of August 2017. All the PCPs were able to virtually join at least one tele-ECHO clinic. Out of 38 participants, two participated in all the tele-ECHO clinics and 47.36\% (n = 18) attended more than six ({\textgreater}60\% of total) tele-ECHO clinics. About 76.31\% (n = 29) of the PCPs presented 41 patient case summaries. Among 38 PCPs, a cumulative of 89.47\% completed three e-Learning assignments. The majority of participants (80\%) used smartphone with 4G connections to join the tele-ECHO clinics. There was a significant change in knowledge gained over the time duration of 1-month (3.00 ± 0.86, P {\textless} 0.001) and 3-month (3.16 ± 0.90, P {\textless} 0.001) assessments compared to the baseline (1.77 ± 1.02). About 32.25\% (n = 10) reported improved confidence level in managing a case of substance use disorder on a 10-point scale.
Conclusion: It has been feasible to connect an academic hub, i.e., NIMHANS to the PCPs of 36 remote districts of Bihar and conduct multipoint videoconference-based tele-ECHO clinics. The results indicate high participant retention. The learners are comfortable in adapting new technology-based learning as evidenced by high rate of e-learning assignment completion. These findings suggest that this new innovative learning model using technology can be an important modality for effective training to address management of drug addiction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the number of US burn centers has declined, access to burn care is increasingly limited. Inexperience in burn wound assessment by referring physicians often results in overtriage or undertriage. In an effort to improve access to burn care in our region, we instituted a program of telemedicine evaluation of acute burns.
METHODS: We created a telemedicine network linking our burn center to three hospitals located 298 to 350 air miles away. Participants agreed to perform telemedicine consultation for acutely burned patients admitted to their emergency departments. We compared consults and referrals from these facilities during the period July 2005 to August 2007 (TELE) to those during a 2-year period before instituting telemedicine (PRE-TELE).
RESULTS: During the TELE period, 80 patients were referred, of whom 70 were seen acutely by telemedicine, compared with 28 PRE-TELE referrals. The groups did not differ in age or burn size. Only 31 patients seen by telemedicine received emergency air transport (44.3\%), compared with 100\% of PRE-TELE patients (p {\textless} 0.05). Nine other TELE patients were transported by family; 30 other patients were treated locally. Ten remaining patients were transported without telemedicine evaluation. TELE patients transported by air had somewhat larger burn sizes (9.0\% vs. 6.5\% total body surface area; p = NS) and longer length of stay (13.0 days vs. 8.0 days; p = NS) than PRE-TELE patients. Burn size estimates by burn center physicians made either by telemedicine or direct inspection correlated closely but both differed significantly from those of referring physicians. Providers and patients expressed a high level of satisfaction with the telemedicine experience.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute evaluation of burn patients can be performed accurately by telemedicine. This can reduce undertriage or overtriage for air transport, improve resource utilization, and both enhance and extend burn center expertise to many rural communities at low cost.},

	abstract = {The convergence of multiple recent developments in health care information technology and monitoring devices has made possible the creation of remote patient surveillance systems that increase the timeliness and quality of patient care. More convenient, less invasive monitoring devices, including patches, wearables, and biosensors, now allow for continuous physiological data to be gleaned from patients in a variety of care settings across the perioperative experience. These data can be bound into a single data repository, creating so-called data lakes. The high volume and diversity of data in these repositories must be processed into standard formats that can be queried in real time. These data can then be used by sophisticated prediction algorithms currently under development, enabling the early recognition of patterns of clinical deterioration otherwise undetectable to humans. Improved predictions can reduce alarm fatigue. In addition, data are now automatically queriable on a real-time basis such that they can be fed back to clinicians in a time frame that allows for meaningful intervention. These advancements are key components of successful remote surveillance systems. Anesthesiologists have the opportunity to be at the forefront of remote surveillance in the care they provide in the operating room, postanesthesia care unit, and intensive care unit, while also expanding their scope to include high-risk preoperative and postoperative patients on the general care wards. These systems hold the promise of enabling anesthesiologists to detect and intervene upon changes in the clinical status of the patient before adverse events have occurred. Importantly, however, significant barriers still exist to the effective deployment of these technologies and their study in impacting patient outcomes. Studies demonstrating the impact of remote surveillance on patient outcomes are limited. Critical to the impact of the technology are strategies of implementation, including who should receive and respond to alerts and how they should respond. Moreover, the lack of cost-effectiveness data and the uncertainty of whether clinical activities surrounding these technologies will be financially reimbursed remain significant challenges to future scale and sustainability. This narrative review will discuss the evolving technical components of remote surveillance systems, the clinical use cases relevant to the anesthesiologist's practice, the existing evidence for their impact on patients, the barriers that exist to their effective implementation and study, and important considerations regarding sustainability and cost-effectiveness.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

	abstract = {Background: The present study describes the development and identity phases of a teleophthalmology system used for screening of diabetic retinopathy.
Methods: A questionnaire was used to identify the main factors necessary for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and the features required for a teleophthalmology system. In the second phase, a web-based prototype of the system was designed using the data collected in the previous phase. In the final phase, the system was optimized based on the users' ideas and comments; then, it was evaluated through a standard usability testing questionnaire.
Results: The results showed that the lowest average percentages were related to ethnicity (61\%), optometrist's office address (61\%), and consultant physician's office address (65\%). A web-based prototype was designed using the Visual Studio and Dreamweaver programming tools. This system comprised patient identity data, medical history, clinical data, and retinal images of the patient. The mean score of usability testing and user satisfaction including specialists, residents, and optometrist was 7.3, 7.1 and 7.3 (out of a total 9), respectively. The evaluation results revealed that the system was classified as good.
Conclusion: The telescreening system suggested in the current study could be helpful in timely diagnosis. Moreover, it would reduce the treatment costs and complexities. Regardless of the positive points of telemedicine systems, one of the most challenges in this study was the Internet infrastructure to design and apply the system. The future studies, therefore, could focus on the application of cell phone technology for rendering teleophthalmology.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVEInterfacility neurosurgical transfers to tertiary care centers are driven by a number of variables, including lack of on-site coverage, limited available technology, insurance factors, and patient preference. The authors sought to assess the timing and necessity of surgery and compared transfers to their institution from emergency departments (ED) and inpatient units at other hospitals.METHODSAdult neurosurgical patients who were transferred to a single tertiary care center were analyzed over 12 months. Patients with traumatic injuries or those referred from skilled nursing facilities or rehabilitation centers were excluded.RESULTSA total of 504 transferred patients were included, with mean age 55 years (range 19-92 years); 53\% of patients were women. Points of origin were ED in 54\% cases and inpatient hospital unit in 46\%, with a mean distance traveled for most patients of 119 miles. Broad diagnosis categories included brain tumors (n = 142, 28\%), vascular lesions, including spontaneous and hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 143, 28\%), spinal lesions (n = 126, 25\%), hydrocephalus (n = 45, 9\%), wound complications (n = 29, 6\%), and others (n = 19, 4\%). Patients transferred from inpatient units had higher rates of surgical intervention (75\% vs 57\%, p {\textless} 0.001), whereas patients transferred from the ED had higher rates of urgent surgery (20\% vs 8\%, p {\textless} 0.001) and shorter mean time to surgery (3 vs 5 days, p {\textless} 0.001). Misdiagnosis rates were higher among ED referrals (11\% vs 4\%, p = 0.008). Across the same timeframe, patients undergoing elective admission (n = 1986) or admission from the authors' own ED (n = 248) had significantly shorter lengths of stay (p {\textless} 0.001) and ICU days (p {\textless} 0.001) than transferred patients, as well as a significantly lower total cost (\$44,412, \$46,163, and \$72,175, respectively; p {\textless} 0.001).CONCLUSIONSThe authors present their 12-month experience from a single tertiary care center without Level I trauma designation. In this cohort, 65\% of patients required surgery, but the rates were higher among inpatient referrals, and misdiagnosis rates were higher among ED transfers. These data suggest that admitting nonemergency patients to local hospitals may improve diagnostic accuracy of patients requiring urgent care, more precisely identify patients in need of transfer, and reduce costs. Referring facilities may lack necessary resources or expertise, and the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) obligates tertiary care centers to accept these patients under those circumstances. Telemedicine and integration of electronic medical records may help guide referring hospitals to pursue additional workup, which may eliminate the need for unnecessary transfer and provide additional cost savings.},

METHODS: A survey was conducted in medical oncology outpatient clinics at the Townsville and Mt Isa hospitals on patients, following their informed consent, using questionnaires. Rurality was defined according to the rural remote and metropolitan area classification.
RESULTS: Of the 180 patients approached, 178 participated. The median distance to the regional trial center for rural participants was 180 km (range 80-1300 km). 45.4\% lived in rural or remote areas and the rest lived in Townsville, a regional metropolitan center. Their overall knowledge was low, with a median knowledge score of 3 (inter-quartile ranges n=2.5). For randomized controlled trials there were no significant relationships between willingness to participate and rurality or education level (P=0.981). Cost of travel (41.1\% rural or remote; 23.5\% regional; P{\textless}0.001) and the need for family or friends to accompany them (38.9\% rural or remote; 24.1\% regional, P=0.021) were more important for rural/remote than regional patients as factors affecting participation.
CONCLUSION: Rural and remote patients are as interested in participating in randomized clinical trials as regional patients. Their knowledge of trials is poor and education earlier in the consultations is needed. Since cost of travel and the need for family members to accompany them are important for rural patients trial budgets should include the cost of travel to encourage participation.},

DESIGN: Multicentre randomised controlled trial with cost effectiveness analysis.
SETTING: UK primary care.
PARTICIPANTS: 288 adolescents and adults with poorly controlled asthma (asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) score ≥ 1.5) from 32 practices.
INTERVENTION: Participants were centrally randomised to twice daily recording and mobile phone based transmission of symptoms, drug use, and peak flow with immediate feedback prompting action according to an agreed plan or paper based monitoring.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in scores on asthma control questionnaire and self efficacy (knowledge, attitude, and self efficacy asthma questionnaire (KASE-AQ)) at six months after randomisation. Assessment of outcomes was blinded. Analysis was on an intention to treat basis.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the change in asthma control or self efficacy between the two groups (ACQ: mean change 0.75 in mobile group v 0.73 in paper group, mean difference in change -0.02 (95\% confidence interval -0.23 to 0.19); KASE-AQ score: mean change -4.4 v -2.4, mean difference 2.0 (-0.3 to 4.2)). The numbers of patients who had acute exacerbations, steroid courses, and unscheduled consultations were similar in both groups, with similar healthcare costs. Overall, the mobile phone service was more expensive because of the expenses of telemonitoring.
CONCLUSIONS: Mobile technology does not improve asthma control or increase self efficacy compared with paper based monitoring when both groups received clinical care to guidelines standards. The mobile technology was not cost effective.

	abstract = {This study evaluated a nurse-delivered, telehealth intervention of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) versus supportive psychotherapy for chronic back pain. Participants (N = 61) had chronic back pain (pain "daily" ≥6 months at an intensity of ≥4 of 10 scale) and were randomized to an 8-week, 12-session, CBT or to supportive care (SC) matched for frequency, format, and time, with each treatment delivered by a primary care nurse. The primary outcome was the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). Secondary outcomes included the numeric rating scale (NRS) and the Patient Global Impressions Scale (CGI). CBT participants (n = 30) showed significant improvements on the RMDQ (mean = 11.4 [SD = 5.9] vs 9.4 [SD = 6.1] at baseline and post-treatment, respectively, P {\textless} .05; d = .33), NRS (mean = 4.9 [SD = 2.1] vs 4.0 [SD = 1.9], respectively, P {\textless} .05; d = .45), and on the CGI (39.1\% reporting "much improved" or "very much improved"). SC participants (n = 31) also showed significant improvements on the RMDQ (mean = 11.1 [SD = 5.4] vs 9.1 [SD = 5.2], respectively, P {\textless} .05; d = .38), the NRS, (mean = 5.0 [SD = 1.9] vs 3.8 [SD = 2.1], respectively, P {\textless} .05; d = .60), and 26.7\% reporting "much improved" or "very much improved" on the CGI. Between groups comparisons of CBT and SC showed no differences on the study outcomes (Ps {\textgreater} .10). The results suggest that telehealth, nurse-delivered CBT, and SC treatments for chronic back pain can offer significant and relatively comparable benefits.
PERSPECTIVE: This article describes the benefits of training primary care nurses to deliver evidence-based behavioral therapies for low back pain. Because of the high prevalence of chronic pain and the growing emphasis on nonopioid therapies, training nurses to provide behavior therapies could be a cost-effective way to improve pain management.},

As a result of this progress, eHealth education programs are becoming a reality in universities, providing the opportunity for students to have greater interaction at live surgery classes by means of virtual participation. Undergraduate students can be introduced to new concepts of medical care, remote second opinion and to telecommunication systems, whilst virtually experiencing surgical procedures and lectures. The better access this provides to the operating theater environment, the patient and the surgeon can improve the learning process for students. An analogical system was used for this experimental pilot project due to the benefits of it being low cost with a comparatively easy setup. The tele-surgery lectures were also transmitted to other universities by means of a Pentium 4 computer using open source software and connected to a portable image acquisition device located in the São Lucas University Hospital. Telemedicine technology has proven to be an important instrument for the improvement of medical education and health care. This study allowed health professionals, professors and students to have greater interaction during surgical procedures, thus enabling a greater opportunity for knowledge exchange.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system provides beneficiary travel reimbursement ("travel pay") to qualifying patients for traveling to appointments. Travel pay is a large expense for the VA and hence the U.S. Government, projected to cost nearly \$1 billion in 2015. Telemedicine in the VA system has the potential to save money by reducing patient travel and thus the amount of travel pay disbursed. In this study, we quantify this savings and also report trends in VA telemedicine volumes over time.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All telemedicine visits based at the VA Hospital in White River Junction, VT between 2005 and 2013 were reviewed (5,695 visits). Travel distance and time saved as a result of telemedicine were calculated. Clinical volume in the mental health department, which has had the longest participation in telemedicine, was analyzed.
RESULTS: Telemedicine resulted in an average travel savings of 145 miles and 142 min per visit. This led to an average travel payment savings of \$18,555 per year. Telemedicine volume grew significantly over the study period such that by the final year the travel pay savings had increased to \$63,804, or about 3.5\% of the total travel pay disbursement for that year. The number of mental health telemedicine visits rose over the study period but remained small relative to the number of face-to-face visits. A higher proportion of telemedicine visits involved new patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine at the VA saves travel distance and time, although the reduction in travel payments remains modest at current telemedicine volumes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the significant access and cost-saving potential of telehealth, the uptake of telehealth services in Australia has been sporadic. Understanding the factors that drive the uptake of home-telehealth services from the consumer perspective has received scant attention in the literature.
AIM: The aim of this study was to explore how a comprehensive set of factors may influence the intention of older Australians to adopt home telehealth services.
METHODS: A survey of 306 Australians aged between 50 and 68 years was conducted to examine the influence of six categories of predictors on the intention of older Australians to adopt home telehealth: (a) demographics, (b) health status and usage, (c) mobility and ease of access to healthcare, (d) technology usage and anxiety with technology, (e) telehealth attitudes, and (f) personality traits.
RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that significant predictors were: trust in telehealth (β = 0.35); the technology acceptance model (β = 0.27); healthcare habits (β = -0.20); dissatisfaction with traditional healthcare (β = 0.19) and online behaviors (β = 0.09). The model explained 63\% of the variance in intention to adopt home telehealth.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first of its kind in Australia and provides valuable insight into the factors which impact consumer's intention to adopt telehealth services.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in lens-free shadow imaging technology have enabled a new class of cell imaging platform, which is a suitable candidate for point-of-care facilities. In this paper, we firstly demonstrate a compact and low-cost telemedicine device providing automated cell and particle size measurement based on lens-free shadow imaging technology. Using the generated shadow (or diffraction) patterns, the proposed approach can detect and measure the sizes of more than several hundreds of micro-objects simultaneously within a single digital image frame. In practical experiments, we defined four types of shadow parameters extracted from each micro-object shadow pattern, and found that a specific shadow parameter (peak-to-peak distance, PPD) demonstrated a linear relationship with the actual micro-object sizes. By using this information, a new algorithm suitable for operation on both a personal computer (PC) and a cell phone was also developed, providing automated size detection of poly-styrenemicro-beads and biological cells such as red blood cells, MCF-7, HepG2, and HeLa. Results from the proposed device were compared with those of a conventional optical microscope, demonstrating good agreement between two approaches. In contrast to other existing cell and particle size measurement approaches, such as Coulter counter, flow-cytometer, particle-size analyzer, and optical microscope, this device can provide accurate cell and particle size information with a 2 µm maximum resolution, at almost no cost (less than 100 USD), within a compact instrumentation size (9.3×9.0×9.0 cm(3)), and in a rapid manner (within 1 min). The proposed lens-free automated particle and cell size measurement device, based on shadow imaging technology, can be utilized as a powerful tool for many cell and particle handling procedures, including environmental, pharmaceutical, biological, and clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Lens-free imaging technology has been extensively used recently for microparticle and biological cell analysis because of its high throughput, low cost, and simple and compact arrangement. However, this technology still lacks a dedicated and automated detection system. In this paper, we describe a custom-developed automated micro-object detection method for a lens-free imaging system. In our previous work (Roy et al.), we developed a lens-free imaging system using low-cost components. This system was used to generate and capture the diffraction patterns of micro-objects and a global threshold was used to locate the diffraction patterns. In this work we used the same setup to develop an improved automated detection and analysis algorithm based on adaptive threshold and clustering of signals. For this purpose images from the lens-free system were then used to understand the features and characteristics of the diffraction patterns of several types of samples. On the basis of this information, we custom-developed an automated algorithm for the lens-free imaging system. Next, all the lens-free images were processed using this custom-developed automated algorithm. The performance of this approach was evaluated by comparing the counting results with standard optical microscope results. We evaluated the counting results for polystyrene microbeads, red blood cells, and HepG2, HeLa, and MCF7 cells. The comparison shows good agreement between the systems, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and linearity slope of 0.877. We also evaluated the automated size profiles of the microparticle samples. This Wi-Fi-enabled lens-free imaging system, along with the dedicated software, possesses great potential for telemedicine applications in resource-limited settings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemedicine is a patient consultation method commonly available to patients in rural and remote areas throughout Australia. Its use in paediatric orthopaedics has been rarely described. The primary aim of this study was to identify the patient cohort accessing the orthopaedic paediatric telehealth service through the Royal Children's Hospital Queensland, so as to better allocate this resource. The secondary aims were to identify the orthopaedic conditions the patients utilizing this service suffered and to follow-up on treatment outcomes to potentially assess clinical benefit.
METHOD: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data of paediatric orthopaedic patients consulted using telehealth at the Royal Children's Hospital, Queensland over a 10-year period between January 2004 and September 2012 was conducted.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-six patient records were assessed with a mean age of 6 years. Results showed that 40\% of patients seen using telehealth in paediatric orthopaedics had documented cerebral palsy, an intellectual disability or congenital syndrome. Common paediatric orthopaedic conditions were seen, with lower limb malalignment being the most common presenting complaint. About 58\% of patients were seen exclusively via telehealth and did not require in-person consultation or operative therapy.
CONCLUSION: We found that the orthopaedic telepaedriatic consultation service at the Royal Children's Hospital reviewed a large proportion of patients with a known disability. We believe there is a role for telehealth medicine for all patients; however, we propose that even greater benefit can be obtained from telehealth consultation in patients with a disability where the cost and inconvenience of patient transport is considerably increased.},

	abstract = {Evidence-based therapeutic and preventive intervention programs (EBIs) have been growing exponentially. Yet EBIs have not been broadly adopted in the United States. In order for our EBI science to significantly reduce disease burden, we need to critically reexamine our scientific conventions and norms. Innovation may be spurred by reexamining the traditional biomedical model for validating, implementing, and diffusing EBI products and science. The model of disruptive innovations suggests that we reengineer EBIs on the basis of their most robust features in order to serve more people in less time and at lower cost. A disruptive innovation provides a simpler and less expensive alternative that meets the essential needs for the majority of consumers and is more accessible, scalable, replicable, and sustainable. Examples of disruptive innovations from other fields include minute clinics embedded in retail chain drug stores, \$2 generic eyeglasses, automated teller machines, and telemedicine. Four new research approaches will be required to support disruptive innovations in EBI science: synthesize common elements across EBIs; experiment with new delivery formats (e.g., consumer controlled, self-directed, brief, paraprofessional, coaching, and technology and media strategies); adopt market strategies to promote and diffuse EBI science, knowledge, and products; and adopt continuous quality improvement as a research paradigm for systematically improving EBIs, based on ongoing monitoring data and feedback. EBI science can have more impact if it can better leverage what we know from existing EBIs in order to inspire, engage, inform, and support families and children to adopt and sustain healthy daily routines and lifestyles.},

Quality and trust are key factors in establishment of teleradiology. Additionally there are organizational, technical, legal, security and linguistic issues influencing the service. Herein, we have used experiences from two partially European Union funded telemedicine projects to evaluate factors affecting cross-border teleradiology. Clinical partners from Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania and the Netherlands went through 649 radiology test cases in two different teleradiology projects to build trust and agree about the report structure. Technical set-up was established using secure Internet data transfer, streaming technology, integration of workflows and creating structured reporting tool to overcome language barriers. The biggest barrier to overcome in cross-border teleradiology was the language issue. Establishment of the service was technically and semantically successful but limited to knee and hip X-ray examinations only because the structured reporting tool did not cover any other anatomical regions yet. Special attention has to be paid to clinical quality and trust between partners in cross-border teleradiology. Our experience shows that it is achievable. Legal, security and financial aspects are not covered in this paper because today they differ country by country.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Remote monitoring (RM) of defibrillators (implantable cardioverter defibrillators [ICDs]) and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices (CRTDs) has been shown to be cost effective, convenient, and associated with reduced mortality and a reduction in the time to physician intervention for actionable events. However, patient compliance with monitoring over time and what factors might influence such compliance have not been well described. This study sought to identify factors contributing to patient noncompliance with RM of ICDs and CRTDs in a large real-world population.
METHODS: Deidentified data on U.S. patients enrolled in the Medtronic CareLink RM system were used to compare patients with no (noncompliant, n = 14,848) and with ≥ 2 RM transmissions (compliant, n = 103,284) during a 14-month period.
RESULTS: Overall noncompliance with RM was 21\%. Younger age (≤ 40), female sex, wanded device, Medicare Census Division, and small clinic size all predicted patient noncompliance (P {\textless} 0.01). Device type (ICD vs CRTD) did not (P = 0.52). Multivariate analysis suggested clinically important predictors of noncompliance to be: age ≤ 40, odds ratio (OR) 2.64 (95\% confidence interval, 2.42-2.88); Medicare Census Division (Mountain vs West North Central), OR 2.15 (1.96-2.37); and small clinic size (1-4 vs {\textgreater}100 patients), OR 4.38 (3.92-4.91).
CONCLUSIONS: There is room for improvement in RM usage among enrolled patients. Younger patients, smaller clinics, and certain geographic areas may be targets for research into interventions to further improve the use of RM.},

This study aims to prove the feasibility of performing an original cost analysis for teleradiology services and show break-even points to perform cost-effective practice.
METHODS: Based on the teleradiology services provided by the Greifswald University Hospital in northeastern Germany, a detailed process analysis and an activity-based costing model revealed costs per service unit according to eight examination categories. The Monte Carlo method was used to simulate the cost amplitude and identify pricing thresholds.
RESULTS: Twenty-two sub-processes and four staff categories were identified. The average working time for one unit was 55 (x-ray) to 72 min (whole-body CT). Personnel costs were dominant (up to 68 \%), representing lower limit costs. The Monte Carlo method showed the cost distribution per category according to the deficiency risk. Avoiding deficient pricing by a likelihood of 90 \% increased the cost of a cranial CT almost twofold as compared with the lower limit cost.
CONCLUSIONS: Original cost analysis is possible when providing teleradiology services with complex statutory requirements in place. Methodology and results provide useful data to help enhance efficiency in hospital management as well as implement realistic reimbursement fees.
KEY POINTS: • Analysis of original costs of teleradiology is possible for a providing hospital • Results discriminate pricing thresholds and lower limit costs to perform cost-effective practice • The study methods represent a managing tool to enhance efficiency in providing facilities • The data are useful to help represent telemedicine services in regular medical fee schedules.},

Total-body photography (TBP) promises to provide a way forward by lowering the costs of dermatologic screening while simultaneously leveraging technology to increase patient access to dermatologic care. Standardized TBP also offers the ability for dermatologists to work synergistically with modern computer technology involving algorithms capable of analyzing high-quality images to flag concerning lesions that may require closer evaluation. On a population level, inexpensive TBP has the potential to increase access to skin cancer screening and it has several specific applications in a military population. The utility of standardized TBP is reviewed in the context of skin cancer screening and teledermatology.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose to advance and transform today's healthcare system using a model of networked health care called Cybercare. Cybercare means "health care in cyberspace" - for example, doctors consulting with patients via videoconferencing across a distributed network; or patients receiving care locally - in neighborhoods, "minute clinics," and homes - using information technologies such as telemedicine, smartphones, and wearable sensors to link to tertiary medical specialists. This model contrasts with traditional health care, in which patients travel (often a great distance) to receive care from providers in a central hospital. The Cybercare model shifts health care provision from hospital to home; from specialist to generalist; and from treatment to prevention. Cybercare employs advanced technology to deliver services efficiently across the distributed network - for example, using telemedicine, wearable sensors and cell phones to link patients to specialists and upload their medical data in near-real time; using information technology (IT) to rapidly detect, track, and contain the spread of a global pandemic; or using cell phones to manage medical care in a disaster situation. Cybercare uses seven "pillars" of technology to provide medical care: genomics; telemedicine; robotics; simulation, including virtual and augmented reality; artificial intelligence (AI), including intelligent agents; the electronic medical record (EMR); and smartphones. All these technologies are evolving and blending. The technologies are integrated functionally because they underlie the Cybercare network, and/or form part of the care for patients using that distributed network. Moving health care provision to a networked, distributed model will save money, improve outcomes, facilitate access, improve security, increase patient and provider satisfaction, and may mitigate the international global burden of disease. In this paper we discuss how Cybercare is being implemented now, and envision its growth by 2030.},

The ultimate goal of eHealth is to rationalize treatment selection to improve patient safety and outcomes. Telemedicine, first used in the 1920s, is the oldest form of eHealth. The introduction of broadband Internet, followed by wireless technologies, has allowed an explosion of mHealth applications within this field. Wearable technologies, such as smartwatches, are now being used for diagnostics and patient monitoring. Challenges remain to develop reusable Clinical Decision Support systems that will streamline the flow of data from clinical laboratories to point of care.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prospective, population-based study of an 8-year follow up. To determine the direct cost of diabetic retinopathy [DR], evaluating our screening programme and the cost of treating DR, focusing on diabetic macular oedema [DMO] after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [anti-VEGF] treatment.
METHODS: A total of 15,396 diabetes mellitus [DM] patients were studied. We determined the cost-effectiveness of our screening programme against an annual programme by applying the Markov simulation model. We also compared the cost-effectiveness of anti-VEGF treatment to laser treatment for screened patients with DMO.
RESULTS: The cost of our 2.5-year screening programme was as follows: per patient with any-DR, €482.85 ± 35.14; per sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy [STDR] patient, €1528.26 ± 114.94; and €1826.98 ± 108.26 per DMO patient. Comparatively, an annual screening programme would result in increases as follows: 0.77 in QALY per patient with any-DR and 0.6 and 0.44 per patient with STDR or DMO, respectively, with an incremental cost-effective ratio [ICER] of €1096.88 for any-DR, €4571.2 for STDR and €7443.28 per DMO patient. Regarding diagnosis and treatment, the mean annual total cost per patient with DMO was €777.09 ± 49.45 for the laser treated group and €7153.62 ± 212.15 for the anti-VEGF group, with a QALY gain of 0.21, the yearly mean cost was €7153.62 ± 212.15 per patient, and the ICER was €30,361.
CONCLUSIONS: Screening for diabetic retinopathy every 2.5 years is cost-effective, but should be adjusted to a patient's personal risk factors. Treatment with anti-VEGF for DMO has increased costs, but the cost-utility increases to 0.21 QALY per patient.},

Patient satisfaction is an important dimension in the evaluation of quality care delivery. We used phonocardiography technique in our experience of fetal home monitoring as it is non invasive and passive in nature, low-cost and easy to use. A lightweight portable phonocardiograph (Fetaphon-home) was assigned to six selected patients, without effective pregnancy risk to monitor fetal heartbeat, uterine contractions and fetal movements at home or wherever they need it. The selected patients were instructed by trained personnel in the use of the monitoring device. Patients were asked to perform the recording two times a week and to transmit 20-min signal to the reference centre. The home monitoring sessions were performed in addition to the routine surveillance at a gynecologist's office; thus, the home monitoring did not replace clinic visits. The women were requested to fill a satisfaction questionnaire in order to evaluate their quality of life and anxiety state. Preliminary results have shown that home fetal surveillance appreciably reduces the need of travel for patients and consequently their stress. Furthermore, our results suggest that, after a short training, pregnant women are able to record and transmit long traces without troubles. Use of telemedicine system was generally well accepted by pregnant women since it increased the possibility of fetal long-term home surveillance which in turn could increase the efficiency of the service offered to them.},

	abstract = {AIM: To compare the theoretical costs of best-practice weight management delivered by dietitians in a traditional, in-person setting compared to remote consultations delivered using eHealth technologies.
METHODS: Using national guidelines, a framework was developed outlining dietitian-delivered weight management for in-person and eHealth delivery modes. This framework mapped one-on-one patient-dietitian consultations for an adult requiring active management (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 ) over a one-year period using both delivery modes. Resources required for both the dietitian and patient to implement each treatment mode were identified, with costs attributed for material, fixed, travel and personnel components. The resource costs were categorised as either establishment or recurring costs associated with the treatment of one patient.
RESULTS: Establishment costs were higher for eHealth compared to in-person costs (\$1394.21 vs \$90.05). Excluding establishment costs, the total (combined dietitian and patient) cost for one patient receiving best-practice weight management for 12 months was \$560.59 for in-person delivery, compared to \$389.78 for eHealth delivery. Compared to the eHealth mode, a higher proportion of the overall recurring delivery costs was attributed to the patient for the in-person mode (46.4\% and 33.9\%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Although it is initially more expensive to establish an eHealth service mode, the overall reoccurring costs per patient for delivery of best-practice weight management were lower compared to the in-person mode. This theoretical cost evaluation establishes preliminary evidence to support alternative obesity management service models using eHealth technologies. Further research is required to determine the feasibility, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these models within dietetic practice.},

COST ACTION IC0604: The integration of digital slides in the electronic health record is one of the main objectives of COST Action IC0604 "Telepathology Network in Europe" (EURO-TELEPATH). Fostering use of medical informatics standards and adapting them to current needs is needed to manage efficiently extremely large medical images, like digital slide files.
DIGITAL SLIDES IN PATHOLOGY: Digital slides can play a role in disease prevention, primary diagnosis, and second opinion. In all these tasks, automated image analysis can also be a most valuable tool.
INTEROPERABILITY IN PATHOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEMS: In order to achieve an efficient interoperability between pathology information systems with other clinical information systems, obtaining a seamless integration of pathology images (gross pictures and digital slides) with LIS-Pathology Information system in a web environment is an important task. Primary care information systems should also be included in the integration, since primary care centres play an essential role in the generation of clinical information and specimen collection. A common terminology, based in SNOMED CT is also needed.
CONCLUSIONS: Main barrier in the integration of digital slides in pathology workflow and eHealth record is the cost of current digital slide scanners. Pathology information system vendors should participate in standardization bodies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the treatment of depression, primary care teams have an essential role, but they are most effective when inserted into a collaborative care model for disease management. In rural areas, the shortage of specialized mental health resources may hamper management of depressed patients.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a remote collaborative care program for patients with depression living in rural areas.
METHODS: In a nonrandomized, open-label (blinded outcome assessor), two-arm clinical trial, physicians from 15 rural community hospitals recruited 250 patients aged 18 to 70 years with a major depressive episode (DSM-IV criteria). Patients were assigned to the remote collaborative care program (n=111) or to usual care (n=139). The remote collaborative care program used Web-based shared clinical records between rural primary care teams and a specialized/centralized mental health team, telephone monitoring of patients, and remote supervision by psychiatrists through the Web-based shared clinical records and/or telephone. Depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, service use, and patient satisfaction were measured 3 and 6 months after baseline assessment.
RESULTS: Six-month follow-up assessments were completed by 84.4\% (221/250) of patients. The remote collaborative care program achieved higher user satisfaction (odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95\% CI 1.25-3.00) and better treatment adherence rates (OR 1.81, 95\% CI 1.02-3.19) at 6 months compared to usual care. There were no statically significant differences in depressive symptoms between the remote collaborative care program and usual care. Significant differences between groups in favor of remote collaborative care program were observed at 3 months for mental health-related quality of life (beta 3.11, 95\% CI 0.19-6.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher rates of treatment adherence in the remote collaborative care program suggest that technology-assisted interventions may help rural primary care teams in the management of depressive patients. Future cost-effectiveness studies are needed.

OBJECTIVE: A survey of emergency and critical care remote presence telemedicine users was conducted to determine the factors that motivate and the barriers that impede the acceptance and maintenance of a robotic telemedicine (RTM) program.
SETTING: The majority of the survey users were in the Emergency Department or in the Intensive Care Unit.
METHODS: E-mail invitations were sent to 483 individuals representing 63 healthcare institutions and groups in North America and Europe. Respondents were directed to a Web-based survey. The survey consisted of 96 separate questions, addressing user familiarity and 5-point Likert scales, addressing issues spanning the conceptual and practical issues surrounding adoption of telemedicine.
RESULTS: A total of 106 surveys were completed, representing an individual response rate of 21.9\% but an institutional response rate of 60.3\%. More than two-thirds of the respondents were physicians who participated in active RTM programs. Across seven different topics related to barriers to implementing RTM, the majority of all respondents indicated that cultural issues did not constitute meaningful hurdles, technological matters were generally favorable, and that most personnel were agreeable to both achieving the buy-in to start an RTM program and to maintaining RTM once started. However, respondents proclaimed that RTM's success was still hampered by licensing, credentialing, and malpractice protection, as well as costs, billing, and reimbursement issues. Achieving immediate patient access, overcoming service gaps, improving quality, providing clinical support, maintaining patient satisfaction, and adhering to practice guidelines were viewed as significant motives for RTM implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: The leading applications of RTM included emergency response and consultation. The patients, physicians, nurses, nor hospital executives served as barriers to implementation. However, licensing, costs for technology, and reimbursement for RTM continue to impede progress.},

	abstract = {Increasingly policy for long term condition management is focussing on new technologies. Telecare is viewed as a means of making services more responsive, equitable, cost and clinically-effective and able to play a central part in mediating between service users, professionals, and service providers. It has also been identified as helping to establish patient self-management for long term conditions. In this paper we consider the social practices of the work of telecare integration and incorporation for patients, their interactions with professionals and the synergy or otherwise with policy makers' expectations for how patients approach, use and interact with services. The research took place in England and in Wales and involved qualitative interviews with 31 individuals. Our research suggests that, telecare services provide both an adequate substitution for traditional services and additional benefits such as minimising the need to travel and the added reassurance of regular external surveillance. However, the nature of patient work involved is 'low level' rather than requiring higher level interpretation of readings and decision making commensurate with realising a policy vision of more independent and responsible self -managers. Indeed a paradox of the reliance and acceptance of telecare is the creation of new relationships and dependencies rather than the diminution of reliance envisaged by policy. The illumination of practices around telecare provides evidence for policy makers and others to adjust the predictions and presumptions about how telecare might enable and promote more effective long term condition management.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Children with cerebral palsy need highly specialized care. This can be very burdensome for families, particularly in large rural states, due to the need for long-distance travel to appointments. In this study, children undergoing the selective percutaneous myofascial lengthening surgery utilized a telephone-based telemedicine evaluation to assess for surgical eligibility. The goal was to avoid a separate preoperative clinic visit weeks before the surgery. If possible, eligibility was determined by telephone, and then, the patient could be scheduled for a clinic visit and possible surgery the next day, saving the family a trip. The purposes of the study were to calculate estimated reductions in miles traveled, in travel expenses, and in carbon emissions and to determine whether the telephone assessment was accurate and effective in determining eligibility for surgery.
METHODS: From 2010 to 2012, 279 patients were retrospectively reviewed, and of those, 161 mailed four-page questionnaire and anteroposterior pelvis X-ray followed by a telephone conference. Geographic information system methods were used to geocode patients by location. Savings in mileage and travel costs were calculated. From 2014 to 2015, 195 patients were additionally studied to determine accuracy and effectiveness.
RESULTS: The telephone prescreening method saved 106,070 miles in transportation over 3 years, a 38\% reduction with US\$55,326 in savings. Each family saved an average of 658 (standard deviation = 340) miles of travel and US\$343.64 (standard deviation = US\$178) in travel expenses. For each increase of 10 miles in distance from the health center, the odds of a patient utilizing telephone screening increased by 10\% (odds ratio: 1.101, 95\% confidence interval: 1.073-1.129, p {\textless} 0.001). After the telephone prescreening, 86\% were determined to be likely candidates for the procedure. For 14\%, a clinic visit only was scheduled, and they were not scheduled for surgery.
CONCLUSION: Families seeking specialized surgical care for their disabled children particularly benefited from this approach.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Ultrasound (US) is a burgeoning diagnostic tool and is often the only available imaging modality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, bedside providers often lack training to acquire or interpret US images. We conducted a study to determine if a remote tele-intensivist could mentor geographically removed LMIC providers to obtain quality and clinically useful US images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine Haitian non-physician health care workers received a 20-minute training on basic US techniques. A volunteer was connected to an intensivist located in the USA via FaceTime. The intensivist remotely instructed the non-physicians to ultrasound five anatomic sites. The tele-intensivist evaluated the image quality and clinical utility of performing tele-ultrasound in a LMIC.
RESULTS: The intensivist agreed (defined as "agree" or "strongly agree" on a five-point Likert scale) that 90\% (57/63) of the FaceTime images were high quality. The intensivist felt comfortable making clinical decisions using FaceTime images 89\% (56/63) of the time.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-physicians can feasibly obtain high-quality and clinically relevant US images using video chat software in LMICs. Commercially available software can connect providers in institutions in LMICs to geographically removed intensivists at a relatively low cost and without the need for extensive training of local providers.},

	abstract = {Scotland is a small nation, yet it leads the field in key areas of aging research. With the creation of a devolved government with authority over health and social services, the country has witnessed practice and policy developments that offer distinctive opportunities for innovative research. With multidisciplinary groups of internationally recognized researchers, Scotland is able to take advantage of a unique set of opportunities for aging research: a well-profiled population brings opportunities in population data and linkage to understand people's interactions with health, social care, and other public services; while research on technology and telecare is a distinctive area where Scotland is recognized internationally for using technology to develop effective, high-quality and well-accepted services at relatively low financial cost. The paper also considers free personal care for older people and the national dementia strategy in Scotland. The potential to evaluate the impact of free personal care will provide valuable information for other global health and social care systems. Exploring the impact of the national dementia strategy is another unique area of research that can advance understanding in relation to quality of life and the development of services. The paper concludes that, while Scotland benefits from unique opportunities for progressive public policy and innovative aging research that will provide valuable lessons at the forefront of a globally aging population, the challenges associated with an aging population and increasing cultural diversity must be acknowledged and addressed to ensure that the vision of equality and social justice for all is realized.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Management of chronic diseases such as movement disorders can be challenging. Nurse-administered telephone follow-up programs have demonstrated clinical and cost efficacy in a variety of health care models. However, their efficacy in movement disorders has not been sufficiently addressed. This observational study fills a knowledge gap by reporting the nature of individuals utilizing a nurse-administered telephone service and the reasons for and the outcomes of calls.
METHOD: Consecutive calls received by the clinic for a 12-month duration were recorded. A sample of 312 calls from 132 patient charts was analyzed. Variables for analysis and coding schema were determined a-priori and included demographic information as well as information around the reasons for and outcomes of calls. The narratives of documented calls were reviewed retrospectively and responses coded for analysis by a separate researcher. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistical methods.
RESULT: Patients made the majority of calls (49\%). 27\% of calls related to worsening symptoms and another 35\% of calls related to medication issues or renewals. The mean call duration was 15.93 minutes. The majority of calls were received mid-way between clinic visits (M = 89.24 days). The nurse resolved 84\% of calls independently. The mean number of calls per patient was 2.93. Issues reported by patients were resolved (approximately 90\%) without need for follow-up emergency, family, or subspecialty clinic visits.
CONCLUSION: The results underscore the complexity of medical issues in a movement disorders population. The current study provides support for a nurse-administered telephone follow-up program in movement disorders.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: As telehealth is increasingly used across the clinical care spectrum to provide patient-centered care, it is important to have robust measures to assess its impact on patient outcomes and care processes. The National Quality Forum (NQF) developed a Telehealth Framework to organize measures and inform target areas for measure development that includes the following four domains: access to care, financial impact or cost, experience, and effectiveness. Our goal is to identify and categorize within the NQF domains currently existing measures of telehealth applicable to oncology to detect priority areas for future research and measure development.
METHODS: We reviewed telehealth-related measures applied to oncology care reported in systematic reviews and identified NQF-endorsed quality measures related to oncology care potentially amenable to telehealth. We organized identified measures by the NQF domains to inform suggestions for advancing the care of patients with cancer through telehealth.
RESULTS: We identified 12 systematic reviews representing 183 studies reporting telehealth-related oncology research. Most studied outcomes related to diagnosis and treatment or user experience and symptom monitoring. Clinical effectiveness measures were most frequently reported (38\%), and most were psychosocial. Patient, family, and/or caregiver experience was the next most frequently reported measure. There were only a few other cancer-related clinical effectiveness measures (eg, morbidity). Most NQF-endorsed oncology measures amenable to telehealth applied to the domains of access to care and effectiveness, with a lack of measures informing financial impact or cost and experience.
CONCLUSION: Overall, there has been a lack of quality measures to assess use of telehealth for the care of oncology patients. Future work should focus on developing measures within each of the NQF-identified domains, with special attention to the financial impact or cost domain.},

However, admission centers (spokes) are subject to financial charges which can make them reluctant to join the system. We implemented and assessed an economic model supporting our telestroke system, Virtuall, France, which includes one expert center (hub) and six spokes.
Methods: The model is based on payment for the expertise provided by the hub, distribution of charges related to telemedicine according to the fees perceived by the spokes, and transfer of patients between the spokes and the hub. We performed a cost-benefit analysis for all patients included in Virtuall from January 2014 to December 2015 to assess the economic balance in each center.
Results: 321 patients were prospectively included in the study. Application of the economic model resulted in overall financial balance with funding of a dedicated medical service in the hub, and reduced costs directly related to telestroke by an average of 10\% in the spokes. The conditions generating the highest costs for the spokes were: a patient returning from the hub for re-hospitalization (mean cost of \$1,995/patient); management of patients treated by intravenous thrombolysis without transfer to the hub (mean cost of \$2,075/patient). The most favorable financial condition for the spokes remained simple transfer of patients to the hub and no return (mean cost of \$329/patient).
Conclusion: We describe an economic model which can be applied to any telestroke system to ensure the optimal balance between hub and spoke centers.},

This study examined the effect of a 9-months remote, telephone-based weight management program for people with physical disabilities using a Web-based system (Personalized Online Weight and Exercise Response System [POWERS]).
DESIGN: A total of 102 participants (mean ± SD age, 46.5 ± 12.7 yrs; body mass index, 32.0 ± 5.8 kg/m(2)) with a physical disability (spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, stroke, or lupus) were randomized to one of three conditions: physical activity only (POWERS), physical activity plus nutrition (POWERS(plus)), and control. The POWERS group received a physical activity tool kit and regular coaching telephone calls. The POWERS(plus) group received an intervention identical to that of the POWERS group plus nutritional information. The control group received the physical activity tool kit and self-guided health promotion resources at the completion of the trial but no coaching.
RESULTS: Postintervention differences in body weight were found between the groups. There was a significant group × time interaction (P {\textless} 0.01) in postintervention body weight, with both the POWERS and POWERS(plus) groups demonstrating greater reduction in body weight compared with the control group (POWERS: -2.1 ± 5.5 kg, -2.4 ± -5.9\%; POWERS(plus): -0.5 ± 5.0 kg, -0.6 ± 4.3\%; control: +2.6 ± 5.3 kg, 3.1 ± 7.4\%).
CONCLUSIONS: A low-cost telephone intervention supported with a Web-based remote coaching tool (POWERS) can be an effective strategy for assisting overweight adults with physical disabilities in maintaining or reducing their body weight.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Older adults with chronic kidney disease have a high rate of uncontrolled hypertension. Home monitoring of blood pressure (BP) is an integral part of management, but requires that patients bring records to clinic visits. Telemonitoring interventions, however, have not targeted older, less technologically-skilled populations.
METHODS: Veterans with stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease and uncontrolled hypertension were randomized to a novel telemonitoring device pairing a Bluetooth-enabled BP cuff with an Internet-enabled hub, which wirelessly transmitted readings (n=28), or usual care (n=15). Home recordings were reviewed weekly and telemonitoring participants were contacted if BP was above goal. The prespecified primary endpoints were improved data exchange and device acceptability. Secondary endpoint was BP change.
RESULTS: Forty-three participants (average age 68 years, 75\% white) completed the 6-month study. Average start-of-study BP was 147/78 mmHg. Those in the intervention arm had a median of 29 (IQR 22, 53) transmitted BP readings per month, with 78\% continuing to use the device regularly, whereas only 20\% of those in the usual care group brought readings to in-person visits. The median number of telephone contacts triggered by the wireless monitoring was 2 (IQR 1, 4) per patient. Both groups had a significant improvement in systolic BP (P{\textless}0.05, for both changes); systolic BP fell a median of 13 mmHg in monitored participants compared with 8.5 mmHg in usual care participants (P for comparison 0.31).
CONCLUSION: This low-cost wireless monitoring strategy led to greater sharing of data between patients and clinic and produced a trend toward improvements in BP control over usual care at 6 months.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In rural America, cigarette smoking is prevalent and health care providers lack the time and resources to help smokers quit. Telephone quitlines are important avenues for cessation services in rural areas, but they are poorly integrated with local health care resources.
OBJECTIVE: The intent of the study was to assess the comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of two models for delivering expert tobacco treatment at a distance: telemedicine counseling that was integrated into smokers' primary care clinics (Integrated Telemedicine-ITM) versus telephone counseling, similar to telephone quitline counseling, delivered to smokers in their homes (Phone).
METHODS: Smokers (n=566) were recruited offline from 20 primary care and safety net clinics across Kansas. They were randomly assigned to receive 4 sessions of ITM or 4 sessions of Phone counseling. Patients in ITM received real-time video counseling, similar to Skype, delivered by computer/webcams in clinic exam rooms. Three full-time equivalent trained counselors delivered the counseling. The counseling duration and content was the same in both groups and was available in Spanish or English. Both groups also received identical materials and assistance in selecting and obtaining cessation medications. The primary outcome was verified 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at month 12, using an intent-to-treat analysis.
RESULTS: There were no significant baseline differences between groups, and the trial achieved 88\% follow-up at 12 months. Verified abstinence at 12 months did not significantly differ between ITM or Phone (9.8\%, 27/280 vs 12\%, 34/286; P=.406). Phone participants completed somewhat more counseling sessions than ITM (mean 2.6, SD 1.5 vs mean 2.4, SD 1.5; P=.0837); however, participants in ITM were significantly more likely to use cessation medications than participants in Phone (55.9\%, 128/280 vs 46.1\%, 107/286; P=.03). Compared to Phone participants, ITM participants were significantly more likely to recommend the program to a family member or friend (P=.0075). From the combined provider plus participant (societal) perspective, Phone was significantly less costly than ITM. Participants in ITM had to incur time and mileage costs to travel to clinics for ITM sessions. From the provider perspective, counseling costs were similar between ITM (US \$45.46, SD 31.50) and Phone (US \$49.58, SD 33.35); however, total provider costs varied widely depending on how the clinic space for delivering ITM was valued.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings did not support the superiority of ITM over telephone counseling for helping rural patients quit smoking. ITM increased utilization of cessation pharmacotherapy and produced higher participant satisfaction, but Phone counseling was significantly less expensive. Future interventions could combine elements of both approaches to optimize pharmacotherapy utilization, counseling adherence, and satisfaction. Such an approach could commence with a telemedicine-delivered clinic office visit for pharmacotherapy guidance, and continue with telephone or real-time video counseling delivered via mobile phones to flexibly deliver behavioral support to patients where they most need it-in their homes and communities.

The CONTACT study tested an individualized telephone support intervention employing problem solving therapy (PST) for mTBI in soldiers recently returned from deployment. We sought to determine the cost effectiveness of this intervention from a military healthcare system perspective. Methods We conducted an intent-to-treat post-hoc analysis by building a decision analytic model that evaluated the choice between using PST or education only (EO). The model included cost-minimization and cost-effectiveness analyses. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the differences in costs of PST versus EO relative to the differences in the outcomes of participants. Results The PST intervention resulted in an annual per-enrolee cost of \$1027 (95\% CI: \$836 to \$1248), while EO costs were \$32 (95\% CI: \$25 to \$39), resulting in a net incremental cost of \$996 per enrolee (95\% CI: \$806 to \$1,217). The ICERs were \$68,658/QALY based on EQ-5D (95\% CI: -\$463,535 to \$596,661) and \$49,284/QALY based on SF-6D (95\% CI: \$26,971 to \$159,309). Estimates of treatment costs in a real-world setting were accompanied by substantially lower ICERs that are within accepted thresholds for willingness-to-pay. Discussion Although the intervention had short-term benefits sufficient to yield acceptable ICERs, there was no long-term effect of PST over EO observed in the study. Consequently, we suggest that future studies examine the use of low-cost approaches, such as booster relapse-prevention calls, that may lead to a sustained treatment benefit for this population.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Remote monitoring systems can replace ambulatory follow-ups, sparing human and economic resources, and increasing patient safety. TARIFF is a prospective, controlled, observational study aimed at measuring the direct and indirect costs and quality of life (QOL) of all participants by a 1-year economic evaluation. A detailed set of hospitalized and ambulatory healthcare costs and losses of productivity that could be directly influenced by the different means of follow-ups will be collected. The study consists of two phases, each including 100 patients, to measure the economic resources consumed during the first phase, associated with standard ambulatory follow-ups, vs. the second phase, associated with remote follow-ups.
CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring systems enable caregivers to better ensure patient safety and the healthcare to limit costs. TARIFF will allow defining the economic value of remote ICD follow-ups for Italian hospitals, third payers, and patients. The TARIFF study, based on a cost-minimization analysis, directly comparing remote follow-up with standard ambulatory visits, will validate the cost effectiveness of the Merlin.net technology, and define a proper reimbursement schedule applicable for the Italian healthcare system.

	abstract = {Follow-up of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices is challenging due to the increasing number and technical complexity of devices coupled to increasing clinical complexity of patients. Remote monitoring (RM) offers the opportunity to optimise clinic workflow and to improve device monitoring and patient management. Several randomised clinical trials and registries have demonstrated that RM may reduce number of hospital visits, time required for patient follow-up, physician and nurse time, hospital and social costs. Furthermore, patient retention and adherence to follow-up schedule are significantly improved by RM. Continuous wireless monitoring of data stored in the device memory with automatic alerts allows early detection of device malfunctions and of events requiring clinical reaction, such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure. Early reaction may improve patient outcome. RM is easy to use and patients showed a high level of acceptance and satisfaction. Implementing RM in daily practice may require changes in clinic workflow. To this purpose, new organisational models have been introduced. In spite of a favourable cost:benefit ratio, RM reimbursement still represents an issue in several European countries.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Remote monitoring (RM) of cardiac implantable electronic devices has been demonstrated to improve outpatient clinic workflow and patient management. However, few data are available on the socioeconomic impact of RM.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the costs and benefits of RM compared with standard care (SC).
METHODS: We used 12-month patient data from the Health Economics Evaluation Registry for Remote Follow-up (TARIFF) study (N = 209; RM: n = 102 (48.81\%); SC: n = 107 (51.19\%)). Cost comparison was made from 2 perspectives: the health care system (HCS) and patients. The use of health care resources was defined on the basis of hospital clinical folders. Out-of-pocket expenses were reported directly by patients.
RESULTS: HCS perspective: The overall mean annual cost per patient in the SC group (€1044.89 ± €1990.47) was significantly higher than in the RM group (€482.87 ± €2488.10) (P {\textless} .0001), with a reduction of 53.87\% being achieved in the RM group. The primary driver of cost reduction was the cost of cardiovascular hospitalizations (SC: €`886.67 ± €1979.13 vs RM: €432.34 ± €2488.10; P = .0030). Patient and caregiver perspective: The annual cost incurred by patients was significantly higher in the SC group than in the RM group (SC: €169.49 ± €189.50 vs RM: €56.87 ± €80.22; P {\textless} .0001). Patients' quality-adjusted life-years were not significantly different between the groups. Provider perspective: The total number of inhospital device follow-up visits was reduced by 58.78\% in the RM group.
CONCLUSION: RM of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) is cost saving from the perspectives of the HCS, patients, and caregivers. Introducing appropriate reimbursements will make RM sustainable even for the provider, i.e. the hospitals which provide the service and encourage widespread adoption of RM.},

The use of telecardiology to assist the access of distant towns to electrocardiography and a second opinion in cardiology is promising; however, it has not been formally assessed.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of implementing a low-cost public telecardiology system in small Brazilian towns.
METHODS: A total of 82 towns in the state of Minas Gerais, with a population {\textless} 10,500 inhabitants, presenting {\textgreater} 70\% coverage by the Family Health Program (Programa Saude da Familia-PSF), local government compliance and internet access, were selected. Each town was supplied with digital electrocardiography (ECG) device and a team was trained. The implementation was coordinated by HC/UFMG, together with four university hospitals in the state of Minas Gerais (UFU, UFTM, UFJF and UNIMONTES). The ECG assessments were carried out in the towns and sent through the Internet for prompt analysis by an on-duty telecardiology team. Online and offline discussions on the medical cases were carried out through the Internet, as well as refreshment courses.
RESULTS: During the implementation period, a total of 253 health professionals were trained. From July 2006 to November 2008, the project assisted 42,664 patients, with a total of 62,865 ECG assessments being performed. A total of 2,148 emergency cases were treated, as well as 420 teleconsultations. The intermediate evaluation showed good acceptance of the implemented technology and a 70\% decrease in patient referrals to other reference centers.
CONCLUSION: The use of the customary resources in informatics to assist the access of small-town populations to electrocardiography and specialized cardiology assessment is feasible.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two senior centers had telehealth kiosks installed, and two other centers served as control sites. Participants with diagnosed hypertension were instructed to use the equipment at least once per week to measure blood pressure (BP). Nurses monitored BP data for 10 months and made referrals based on primary care physicians' protocols.
RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 74.1 years, 75\% were women, and mean baseline systolic BPs were 131 and 138 mm Hg in the intervention and control groups, respectively. At baseline, 64\% and 85\% of participants reported ever having owned a home computer and cell phone, respectively, and 84\% reported having used an automated BP device outside of a doctor's office. At 10 months, mean systolic BP was 126 and 132 mm Hg in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Intervention participants used the telehealth station once per week during 69\% of all follow-up weeks, and 71\% of high readings received nurse follow-up within 24 h. Kiosk use increased steadily during the follow-up period, peaking at 80\%, but declined over time to 47\% at 10 months. Nearly all intervention group participants reported being "very comfortable" with the technology at study end, 81\% reported it was "very easy" to use, and 89\% would recommend it to friends. Senior center staff reported that the technology was consistent with their organizational mission and that clients and boards of directors were enthusiastic about it.
CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that telehealth was embraced by clients and staff of community-based senior centers. A larger study is needed to determine the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of using senior centers as a venue for telehealth-based management of hypertension and other common chronic conditions.},

	abstract = {Although European groups have initiated innovative clinical research in the field of insulin pump therapy, insulin pump use remains currently limited in many European countries, and well behind that in the United States. The main reason is the late approval of cost coverage by most national healthcare insurance systems, which is still lacking in some countries. Partly in connection with this delay, the number of trained physicians to pump therapy is low in many countries, while diabetes educators do not exist as an acknowledged entity in many European countries, and pump manufacturers are excluded from the education process of patients in most of them. Pump use in pediatric-age populations has strongly increased during the last years, following the evidence-based demonstrations of the benefits of pump therapy in these patients leading to an international consensus on pump indications and practice. Failure to control type 1 diabetes to target and frequent hypoglycemia under multiple daily insulin injections are consensus-based but restrictive indications for pump therapy in adults in most countries. The economic burden on healthcare insurance systems does not facilitate wider use of insulin pumps, but a significant expansion of pump therapy according to consensus-based indications is still expected thanks to the growing knowledge of physicians in technologies and because of the increasing interest of patients to use technology to improve their control of diabetes and health-related quality of life. More sophisticated technologies connected to pump therapy, such as continuous glucose monitoring or telemedicine, will need specific cost coverage for a true implementation in diabetes care in Europe.},

To share high-quality medical resources and conduct centralized management of telemedicine systems, a regional telemedicine system (RTS) (such as a provincial level system) has been developed to integrate with small-scale telemedicine systems. Although the established systems offer integration services, they are tightly coupled systems, and not easily integrated with new systems. Meanwhile, with the increasing of input/output, it is difficult for them to run with high scalability, considering the cost of architecture redesign and further development. This article presents the design and implementation of regional integration system through a study in Henan, China, mainly aimed to integrate with heterogeneous small-scale telemedicine systems and provide high efficiency.
METHODS: A provincial telemedicine system and some city-level telemedicine systems have already been established. The provincial system has been built to act as a regional integration system to connect city-level systems. Adopting message-based technology, the provincial system achieves high availability and high scalability, respectively, through LevelDB + ZooKeeper and multicast.
RESULTS: The system achieved the centralized management of established telemedicine systems without restructuring their framework, improving high availability of RTS when one ActiveMQ service node in a group failed, and it did not negatively influence normal business logic when adding a new service node. At the same time, two "Master" state ActiveMQ service nodes provided services simultaneously, which enable the RTS to achieve high scalability.
CONCLUSIONS: The message-based regional integration system enriched the RTS with high availability, easy extensibility, and provided a convenient way to integrate new small-scale telemedicine systems.},

INTRODUCTION: Telepsychiatry has increased access to health care using real-time interactive videoconferencing, allowing clinicians and patients in separate locations to have a meaningful clinical encounter. Use has increased over the past several years given cost reduction and need for psychiatric specialty services in under-resourced systems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated data regarding child psychiatry fellow use of telepsychiatry through a prospective real-time questionnaire filled out by the on-call clinician from July 1, 2017 to December 23, 2017 (study period). LOS was measured from the patient's registration time through time of discharge.
RESULTS: Telepsychiatry significantly reduced the total monthly LOS for nonhospitalized patients in the PedsER during the study period compared to all prior months (285-193 h; p = 0.032) and compared to a similar prior seasonal time frame (329-193 h; p = 0.017). Telepsychiatry use reduced travel for face-to-face evaluations by 75\% and saved 2.22 h per call day.
DISCUSSION: Unique in this study is enhancing on-site psychiatric consultation in the emergency room, rather than solving a systems issue of referring out for psychiatric consultation. Moreover, this study uniquely demonstrated a noted improvement in on-call physician travel burden by reducing travel time with telepsychiatry. Physician burnout is notably high during residency training. Factors such as telepsychiatry can improve work efficiency and lend time to activities outside of work, mitigating the onset of this challenging issue.
CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychiatry was shown to be effective in reducing dwell time and improving on-call burden. This study also showed promise in our system for improving access to other forms of specialized care consultation in PedsER settings.},

A case in point is the six year experience of telemedicine at The Norwegian Radium Hospital, in distributing radiotherapy services to two satellite hospitals hundred kilometers far off. The main lesson learned is: the most serious obstacles are not technological but socio-psychological challenges and that staff up-dating, prior to implementation, is crucial. Case selections, routines, work flows and administrative solutions are described for the daily operations between the main clinic and the satellite units.
IN CONCLUSION: radiotherapy service by telemedicine is feasible and cost effective. Standardization and quality assurance of radiotherapy at the quality level of a comprehensive cancer center can be offered to a much larger population and may play a role in improved cancer survival outcome.},

It is the intention of the international project Medolution (Medical care evolution) to develop new approaches in order to create best structures for telemonitoring of LVAD patients. In the very early period of the project a questionnaire was sent to 180 LVAD patients to evaluate the need and acceptance of telemonitoring. Thereafter, a graphical user interface (GUI) mockup was developed as one of the first steps to improve the continuous contact between the LVAD patient and the physician. As a final goal the Medolution project aims to bundle all relevant informations from different data sources into one platform in order to provide the physician a comprehensive overview of a patient's situation. In the systems background a big data analysis should run permanently and should try to detect abnormalities and correlations as well. At crucial events, a notification system should inform the physician and should provide the causing data via a decision support system. With this new system we are expecting early detection and prevention of common and partially life-threatening complications, less readmissions to the hospital, an increase in quality of life for the patients and less costs for the health care system as well.},

These plans generate much lower average health care expenditure than the basic insurance plan. The question is, however, to what extent these total savings are due to the effects of selection and efficiency.
METHODS: The empirical analysis is based on data from 399,274 Swiss residents that constantly had compulsory health insurance with the Helsana Group, the largest health insurer in Switzerland, covering the years 2006-2009. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the different integrated care models, we apply an econometric approach with a mixed-effects model.
RESULTS: Our estimations indicate that the efficiency effects of integrated care models on health care expenditure are significant. However, the different insurance plans vary, revealing the following efficiency gains per model: contracted capitated model 21.2\%, contracted non-capitated model 15.5\% and telemedicine model 3.7\%. The remaining 8.5\%, 5.6\% and 22.5\%, respectively, of the variation in total health care expenditure can be attributed to the effects of selection.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrated care models have the potential to improve care for patients with chronic diseases and concurrently have a positive impact on health care expenditure. We suggest policy-makers improve the incentives for patients with chronic diseases within the existing regulations providing further potential for cost-efficiency of medical care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism affects as many as 1 in 68 children in the United States. Early identification and access to intervention services promote improved outcomes for children with autism and other developmental delays. Children living in rural and underserved areas have limited access to such services and are diagnosed later than those living more suburban and urban areas. Our Integrated Systems Using Telemedicine (ISUT) Model uses a cost-effective method for families to access diagnostic and other specialty care through telemedicine. This model links families, trained early intervention providers and educators, and university-based medical professionals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We trained autism diagnostic teams throughout the state who completed diagnostic measures and connected to university medical center teams for final diagnosis of autism and coexisting conditions. We gathered preliminary data to measure the impact of the ISUT model on access to services, potential cost savings for families, and parent satisfaction with the model.
RESULTS: Preliminary data indicate that our ISUT model provided families in rural and underserved areas improved access to diagnostic services as well as cost savings for travel. Our satisfaction data indicate that parents are equally satisfied with services received through the ISUT and through the University-Based Medical Center Team Model.
CONCLUSIONS: The ISUT model provides a unique collaboration among the family, educational system, autism experts in the community, and the university medical center autism team while providing a cost-effective means for families to access specialty care while promoting coordination of care within the community.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Older adults with multiple chronic conditions face the complex task of medication management involving multiple medications of varying doses at different times. Advances in telehealth technologies have resulted in home-based devices for medication management and health monitoring of older adults. We examined older adults' perceptions of a telehealth medication dispensing device as part of a clinical trial involving home healthcare clients, nurse coordination and use of the medication dispensing device.
METHODS: Ninety-six frail older adult participants who used the medication dispensing device for 12 months completed a satisfaction survey related to perceived usefulness and reliability. Results were analyzed and grouped by themes in the following areas: Ease of Use, Reliability, Medication Management Assistance, Routine Task Performance and Acceptability.
RESULTS: Nearly all participants perceived the medication dispensing device as very easy to use, very reliable and helpful in the management of their medications. Eighty-four percent of participants expressed a desire to use the machine in the future.
CONCLUSION: The technology-enhanced medication management device in this study is an acceptable tool for older adults to manage medication in collaboration with home care nurses. Improved usability and cost models for medication dispensers are areas for future research.},

DESIGN: Retrospective and prospective hospital-based clinical audits of 5456 patients; descriptive survey of available telehealth equipment in 129 regional facilities; cost calculations for teleophthalmology, patient transfers and outreach services.
SETTING: Primary (optometry, general practice [GP], Aboriginal Medical Service [AMS]) and secondary (hospital) sites in regional Western Australia; a tertiary hospital in Perth.
KEY MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT: Proportion of patients suitable for teleophthalmology; proportion of regional practices with telehealth technology; capital expenditure to equip regional practices for teleophthalmology; total savings from increased utilisation of teleophthalmology.
STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE: Advocacy for funding, regulatory, training and infrastructure recommendations, in order to support efficient models of teleophthalmology.
EFFECTS OF CHANGE: A total of 15\% and 24\% of urgent patient transfers and outreach consultations, respectively, were found to be suitable for teleophthalmology, equating to a potential total cost saving of \$1.1 million/year. Capital expenditure required for basic telehealth equipment was negligible for optometrists, compared to \$20 500 per GP/AMS practice. Successful advocacy led to funding, training and policy changes to support optometry-led teleophthalmology for country patients in Australia.
LESSONS LEARNT: Public-private partnerships can result in significant cost-savings for the Australian health system. Targeted, evidence-based advocacy can inform government health reforms.},

To eliminate this requirement in the United States, two key components of the standard initial visit would need to be restructured. First, alternatives to ultrasound and pelvic exam would need to be identified for ensuring that gestational age is within the limit for safe and effective treatment. This is probably feasible: for example, data from a large study suggest that in selected patients menstrual history is highly sensitive for this purpose. Second, the Food and Drug Administration would need to remove the medically unwarranted restriction on distribution of mifepristone. These two changes could allow provision of the service by a broader range of providers in nontraditional venues or even by telemedicine. Such options could have profound benefits in reducing cost and expanding access to abortion.},

Mobile health (mHealth) technologies can overcome these barriers while preserving critical attributes of center-based exCR monitoring and coaching, but these opportunities have not yet been capitalized on.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to design and develop an evidence- and theory-based mHealth platform for remote delivery of exCR to any geographical location.
METHODS: An iterative process was used to design and develop an evidence- and theory-based mHealth platform (REMOTE-CR) that provides real-time remote exercise monitoring and coaching, behavior change education, and social support.
RESULTS: The REMOTE-CR platform comprises a commercially available smartphone and wearable sensor, custom smartphone and Web-based applications (apps), and a custom middleware. The platform allows exCR specialists to monitor patients' exercise and provide individualized coaching in real-time, from almost any location, and provide behavior change education and social support. Intervention content incorporates Social Cognitive Theory, Self-determination Theory, and a taxonomy of behavior change techniques. Exercise components are based on guidelines for clinical exercise prescription.
CONCLUSIONS: The REMOTE-CR platform extends the capabilities of previous telehealth exCR platforms and narrows the gap between existing center- and home-based exCR services. REMOTE-CR can complement center-based exCR by providing an alternative option for patients whose needs are not being met. Remotely monitored exCR may be more cost-effective than establishing additional center-based programs. The effectiveness and acceptability of REMOTE-CR are now being evaluated in a noninferiority randomized controlled trial.},

	abstract = {In recent decades several major changes in computer and communication technology have pushed the limits of imaging informatics and PACS beyond the traditional system architecture providing new perspectives and innovative approach to a traditionally conservative medical community. Disruptive technologies such as the world-wide-web, wireless networking, Open Source software and recent emergence of cyber communities and social networks have imposed an accelerated pace and major quantum leaps in the progress of computer and technology infrastructure applicable to medical imaging applications.
METHODS: This paper reviews the impact and potential benefits of two major trends in consumer market software development and how they will influence the future of medical imaging informatics. Open Source software is emerging as an attractive and cost effective alternative to traditional commercial software developments and collaborative social networks provide a new model of communication that is better suited to the needs of the medical community.
OBSERVATIONS: Evidence shows that successful Open Source software tools have penetrated the medical market and have proven to be more robust and cost effective than their commercial counterparts. Developed by developers that are themselves part of the user community, these tools are usually better adapted to the user's need and are more robust than traditional software programs being developed and tested by a large number of contributing users. This context allows a much faster and more appropriate development and evolution of the software platforms. Similarly, communication technology has opened up to the general public in a way that has changed the social behavior and habits adding a new dimension to the way people communicate and interact with each other. The new paradigms have also slowly penetrated the professional market and ultimately the medical community. Secure social networks allowing groups of people to easily communicate and exchange information is a new model that is particularly suitable for some specific groups of healthcare professional and for physicians. It has also changed the expectations of how patients wish to communicate with their physicians.
CONCLUSION: Emerging disruptive technologies and innovative paradigm such as Open Source software are leading the way to a new generation of information systems that slowly will change the way physicians and healthcare providers as well as patients will interact and communicate in the future. The impact of these new technologies is particularly effective in image communication, PACS and teleradiology.},

It was implemented in the main referring hospital of Bhutan equipped with a CT, an MRI, digital radiology, and a suite of several ultrasound units. They lacked the necessary informatics infrastructure for image archiving and interpretation and needed a system for distribution of images to clinical wards. The solution developed for this project combines several open source software platforms in a robust and versatile archiving and communication system connected to analysis workstations equipped with a FDA-certified version of the highly popular Open-Source software. The whole system was implemented on standard off-the-shelf hardware. The system was installed in three days, and training of the radiologists as well as the technical and IT staff was provided onsite to ensure full ownership of the system by the local team. Radiologists were rapidly capable of reading and interpreting studies on the diagnostic workstations, which had a significant benefit on their workflow and ability to perform diagnostic tasks more efficiently. Furthermore, images were also made available to several clinical units on standard desktop computers through a web-based viewer.
MESSAGES/TEACHING POINTS: • Open source imaging informatics platforms can provide cost-effective alternatives for PACS • Robust and cost-effective open architecture can provide adequate solutions for emerging countries • Imaging informatics is often lacking in hospitals equipped with digital modalities.},

Our aim was to explore the effects of telemedicine supported GDM care on a range of health service utilisation and maternal and foetal outcomes.
METHODS: An exploratory randomised controlled trial of adjunct telemedicine support in the management of insulin-treated GDM compared to usual care control. Outcomes included health service use, maternal and foetal clinical outcomes as well as costs. Groups were compared on outcomes and Poisson and Cox regression analysis were performed for predictors of health service utilisation, glycaemic control and costs.
RESULTS: 95 participants were recruited (intervention n = 61, control n = 34). There were no differences between the groups in number of face-to-face appointments (median (IQR) intervention = 8(7), control = 8(6), p = 0.843), rates of caesareans, macrosomia, large for gestational age, special care nursery admission or newborn birth-weight. The intervention had no impact on total (IRR = 1.04, p = 0.596) or face-to-face (IRR = 1.09, p = 0.257) clinic appointments or service provider costs. Participants receiving the intervention reached optimum glycaemic control quicker: mean (SD) 4.3(4.2) weeks vs. 7.6(4.5) weeks, p = 0.0001). Telemedicine was a significant predictor of better glycaemic control (HR = 1.71(95\%CI: 1.11, 2.65, p = 0.015).
CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine support for GDM care showed no impact on service utilisation and costs. The intervention produced similar GDM clinical outcomes as usual care and posed no added risk to clinical quality of care. The intervention may be associated with fewer insulin dose titrations and participants achieved optimum glycaemic control sooner.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The intent was to evaluate time to match initial investment of a new, statewide correctional system telehealth program based upon cumulative savings by avoidance of transportation and custody-related costs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The setting was a statewide correctional system where prisoners received medical care through enhanced telemedicine technology supported by newly recruited specialty providers delivered through an open architecture system. The patients were incarcerated persons requiring nonemergent consultations in 10 specialties. A financial model was created to estimate transportation expenses, including vehicular use and custody staff, during the out of prison travel for traditional face-to-face care. Cost savings were then estimated by multiplying transportation expenses by the number of telehealth encounters (avoided cost) and summed cumulatively. Savings were mapped monthly. Private sector specialists were recruited, provided security clearance, trained in the use of the technology, and provided a secure site to provide services.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Based on the financial model, 1.2 million dollars in savings, equaling the initial capital investment, were achieved at 32 months. The total number of patient telemedicine encounters increased from 2,365 (±98/month) to 3,748 during the first 32 months of operation (July 2013 through January 2016: ±117/month) with 89\% of the established specialties performed by telemedicine technologies.
DISCUSSION: It was initially estimated to require 48 months to achieve the investment savings, but savings were achieved in 32 months, demonstrating greater adoption than expected. While finances were quantifiable, enhanced public safety by avoidance of out of prison time is unquantifiable, but judged to be significant.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2014, in the United Kingdom, the government made a commitment to spend £3.6 million on the introduction of Skype video calling consultations in general practice, however the efficacy of such technology has not yet been explored fully.AimThe study aimed to explore the views and attitudes of General Practitioners (GPs) towards video consultation in primary care; specifically, in three broad areas ∙The benefits of video consultations to patients and healthcare professionals.∙Potential problems with video consultation and its implementation.∙The cost-effectiveness of video consultation in this setting.
METHOD: A convenience sample of the views of 12 general practitioners across two primary care centres in North London were identified using topic guide based semi-structured interviews. A thematic framework approach was used to analyse the data collected to isolate main and sub-themes.FindingsThree main themes were identified 1.Technology - GPs expressed concerns about the ability of patients to use technology, the availability of technology and the quality of technology available.2.Utility - encompassing GP's ideas about the usefulness of video consultations to patients, practitioners and the doctor-patient relationship. GPs presented mixed views on the extent to which video consultation would be useful.3.Practicality - covering the views of GPs on implementation and effects on workload. GPs unanimously felt that it was not a practical substitute for face-to-face consultation. There were mixed feelings about it being used as an alternative to telephone consultation.
CONCLUSION: GPs did see potential benefits to using video consultations but also expressed concerns that need to be addressed if they are to have full confidence in the system. The views of those who are going to use video consultation as a means of increasing patient access are paramount if such tools are to be a core part of primary care.},

METHODS: Electronic consultation triggered a text page to an on-call staff cardiologist at Brooke Army Medical Center. Cardiology teleconsultations for the first 3.5 years were analyzed.
RESULTS: Two hundred seven cardiology teleconsults were managed, with an average response time of 4 hours 54 minutes. The three most prevalent reasons for teleconsultation were electrocardiographic abnormalities, chest pain syndromes, and syncope. Six evacuations were avoided; 29 evacuations were facilitated. An estimated \$144,000 was saved, plus intangible benefits.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiology teleconsultation provides a valuable service to deployed providers, decreases medical evacuation costs, and facilitates transfer of patients to appropriate facilities.},

	abstract = {CONCLUSION: Remote cochlear implant (CI) programming is a viable, safe, user-friendly and cost-effective procedure, equivalent to standard programming in terms of efficacy and user's perception, which can complement the standard procedures. The potential benefits of this technique are outlined.
OBJECTIVES: We assessed the technical viability, risks and difficulties of remote CI programming; and evaluated the benefits for the user comparing the standard on-site CI programming versus the remote CI programming.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Remote Programming System (RPS) basically consists of completing the habitual programming protocol in a regular CI centre, assisted by local staff, although guided by a remote expert, who programs the CI device using a remote programming station that takes control of the local station through the Internet. A randomized prospective study has been designed with the appropriate controls comparing RPS to the standard on-site CI programming. Study subjects were implanted adults with a HiRes 90K(R) CI with post-lingual onset of profound deafness and 4-12 weeks of device use. Subjects underwent two daily CI programming sessions either remote or standard, on 4 programming days separated by 3 month intervals. A total of 12 remote and 12 standard sessions were completed. To compare both CI programming modes we analysed: program parameters, subjects' auditory progress, subjects' perceptions of the CI programming sessions, and technical aspects, risks and difficulties of remote CI programming.
RESULTS: Control of the local station from the remote station was carried out successfully and remote programming sessions were achieved completely and without incidents. Remote and standard program parameters were compared and no significant differences were found between the groups. The performance evaluated in subjects who had been using either standard or remote programs for 3 months showed no significant difference. Subjects were satisfied with both the remote and standard sessions. Safety was proven by checking emergency stops in different conditions. A very small delay was noticed that did not affect the ease of the fitting. The oral and video communication between the local and the remote equipment was established without difficulties and was of high quality.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the cost and outcome of a community-based hearing screening programme in which village health workers (VHWs) screened children in their homes using a two-step DPOAE screening protocol. Children referred in a second screening underwent tele diagnostic ABR testing in a mobile tele-van using satellite connectivity or at local centre using broadband internet at the rural location.
DESIGN: Economic analysis was carried out to estimate cost incurred and outcome achieved for hearing screening, follow-up diagnostic assessment and identification of hearing loss. Two-way sensitivity analysis determined the most beneficial cost-outcome.
STUDY SAMPLE: 1335 children under 5 years of age underwent screening by VHWs.
RESULTS: Nineteen of the 22 children referred completed the tele diagnostic evaluation. Five children were identified with hearing loss. The cost-outcomes were better when using broadband internet for tele-diagnostics. The use of least expensive human resources and equipment yielded the lowest cost per child screened (Rs.1526; \$23; €21). When follow-up expenses were thus maximised, the cost per child was reduced considerably for diagnostic hearing assessment (Rs.102,065; \$1532; €1368) and for the cost per child identified (Rs.388,237; \$5826; €5204).
CONCLUSION: Settings with constrained resources can benefit from a community-based programme integrated with tele diagnostics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mobile technology offers the prospect of delivering high-value care with increased patient access and reduced costs. Advances in mobile health (mHealth) and telemedicine have been inhibited by the lack of interconnectivity between devices and software and inability to process consumer sensor data. The objective of this study was to preliminarily validate a motion-based machine learning software development kit (SDK) for the shoulder compared with a goniometer for 4 arcs of motion: (1) abduction, (2) forward flexion, (3) internal rotation, and (4) external rotation.
METHODS: A mobile application for the SDK was developed and "taught" 4 arcs of shoulder motion. Ten subjects without shoulder pain or prior shoulder surgery performed the arcs of motion for 5 repetitions. Each motion was measured by the SDK and compared with a physician-measured manual goniometer measurement. Angular differences between SDK and goniometer measurements were compared with univariate and power analyses.
RESULTS: The comparison between the SDK and goniometer measurement detected a mean difference of less than 5° for all arcs of motion (P {\textgreater} .05), with a 94\% chance of detecting a large effect size from a priori power analysis. Mean differences for the arcs of motion were: abduction, -3.7° ± 3.2°; forward flexion, -4.9° ± 2.5°; internal rotation, -2.4° ± 3.7°; and external rotation -2.6° ± 3.4°.
DISCUSSION: The SDK has the potential to remotely substitute for a shoulder range of motion examination within 5° of goniometer measurements. An open-source motion-based SDK that can learn complex movements, including clinical shoulder range of motion, from consumer sensors offers promise for the future of mHealth, particularly in telemonitoring before and after orthopedic surgery.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: There are many ways a mobile stroke unit (MSU) might prove valuable for patients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, such as earlier recognition, more accurate triage, improved management of blood pressure and other critical physiological variables, and eventually earlier implementation of effective therapies. The MSU may be particularly valuable for treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, the most evidence-based effective emergency treatment for the most prevalent stroke diagnosis.
OBJECTIVES: To review existing data on prehospital stroke treatment, especially relevant to MSU technology, to identify gaps in our understanding of MSU feasibility, especially relevant to applying the MSU strategy in the United States, and to describe the Houston MSU program and clinical trial.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: Published data from English-language journals in PubMed from 1995 to present reviewing early treatment with tPA and prehospital stroke evaluation and treatment.
FINDINGS: The MSU may result in an overall shift toward earlier evaluation and treatment with tPA, particularly into the first hour after symptom onset, leading to substantially better outcomes. As a result of improved clinical outcomes owing to earlier treatment, the costs of an MSU program may be offset by a reduction in the costs of long-term stroke care and an increase in quality-adjusted life-years, thereby supporting more widespread use of this technology. To make MSU deployment more practical, the vascular neurologist aboard the MSU must be replaced by a remote vascular neurologist connected to the MSU by telemedicine, reducing manpower requirements and costs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The MSU strategy could dramatically transform the way acute stroke is managed in the United States. A prospective study evaluating the logistics, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of this approach is needed and under way.},

	abstract = {Research progressing during the last decade focuses more on non-contact based systems to monitor Heart Rate (HR) which are simple, low-cost and comfortable to use. Most of the non-contact based systems are using RGB videos which is suitable for lab environment. However, it needs to progress considerably before they can be applied in real life applications. As luminance (light) has significance contribution on RGB videos HR monitoring using RGB videos are not efficient enough in real life applications in outdoor environment. This paper presents a HR monitoring method using Lab color facial video captured by a webcam of a laptop computer. Lab color space is device independent and HR can be extracted through facial skin color variation caused by blood circulation considering variable environmental light. Here, three different signal processing methods i.e., Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) have been applied on the color channels in video recordings and blood volume pulse (BVP) has been extracted from the facial regions. In this study, HR is subsequently quantified and compare with a reference measurement. The result shows that high degrees of accuracy have been achieved compared to the reference measurements. Thus, this technology has significant potential for advancing personal health care, telemedicine and many real life applications such as driver monitoring.},

	abstract = {GOAL: To identify any major factors that could affect patients' perceptions of a Home Telecare Management System (HTMS) and use the findings to contribute to development of a theoretical framework for patient acceptance of HTMS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten Focus Group Interviews (FGIs) were conducted with patients suffering from congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or both, from seven different ethnic groups in Sydney. Six key discussion points were used to conduct the FGIs. The participants were shown a video demonstrating the HTMS and its operation, followed by the demonstration of an HTMS prototype. The participants, who had no prior experience with the HTMS, were then asked questions to access their perceptions in potentially real situations. The discussions were audio-taped and content analysis performed.
RESULTS: Four major themes and 16 sub-themes were identified. The themes were: intention to use the HTMS, the impact of the HTMS on patients' health management, concerns associated with using the HTMS, and the impact of the HTMS on healthcare services.
CONCLUSION: Most participants perceived the system as a useful and convenient mode of health care delivery, expressed positive attitudes toward the HTMS and expressed intent to use the system. However, there were concerns centred on the issues of cost, ease of use, clinical support, low self-efficacy and anxiety related to the use of the HTMS. The findings of this study suggest that HTMS self-efficacy and anxiety are likely to be important constructs in patients' acceptance of home telecare. Therefore, we propose these two factors be included in future HTMS acceptance models. Also it is suggested that in order to develop training programs for patients to use HTMS, tailored training components should aim to reduce 'HTMS anxiety' and improve 'HTMS self-efficacy'. Participants agreed that the HTMS would save cost and time by reducing hospital admissions, emergency department and medical practitioner visits and associated travel. Participants generally agreed that the HTMS could inform patients of their health conditions, thus promoting active participation in their health management and empowering them to perform better self-care. Also, they agreed that the HTMS could improve their health management by their doctors by providing more accurate and up-to-date information, to help them make better decisions. They suggested that the HTMS could have a preventative role in terms of providing early warning when their health conditions were deteriorating, which could lead to on-time appropriate interventions. The latter may result in reducing the use of emergency services and hospital admissions.},

However, the sustainability of home telehealth programs remains a major challenge. This qualitative study explored the reasons for the initial adoption and the eventual decline of a decade-long home telehealth program at a Texas home health agency (HHA). Barriers to and facilitators for sustaining home telehealth programs were also explored.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Semistructured interviews of 13 HHA nursing staff and administrators, 1 physician, and 9 patients aged {\textgreater}55 years and their informal caregivers who used telehealth were conducted in summer 2013. Interview transcripts were analyzed using conventional content analysis.
RESULTS: Data analysis generated 5 themes representing the decline of the Texas home telehealth program: its impact on patient-centered outcomes, its cost-effectiveness, patient-clinician and interprofessional communication, technology usability, and home health management culture. Lack of significant impact on patient outcomes, in addition to financial, technical, management, and communication-related challenges, adversely affected the sustainability of this home telehealth program.
IMPLICATIONS: A home telehealth program that attains patient-centered outcomes, improves cost-effectiveness of managing chronic diseases, improves quality of communication among patients and clinicians, is user-friendly for older adults, and involves end users in decision making is likely to be sustainable.},

	abstract = {Background: In 2006, the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD) was established. The GARD strategy is based mainly on activities aimed at implementing preventive tasks at a local and global level. In Poland, the National Health Program (NHP) is the strategic document describing the tasks of governmental and local administration in the field of public health. One of the activities under the NHP is a project to carry out mass allergy screening (of children and adolescents at school age) and to organize an information and education campaign.
Methods: In 2017-2018, the screening will cover a group of at least 10,000 children and adolescents at school age (6-18 years of age) in 10 of 16 voivodships in Poland. In the study, the e-health tool for early pre-medical risk assessment of allergic diseases was used. The algorithm determines the risk of bronchial asthma (BA) and allergic rhinitis (AR) based on a series of 38 questions on the symptoms of allergic diseases. In order to assess the effectiveness of the screening test (algorithm) a validation study was carried out before screening. Moreover, the algorithm was calibrated on the basis of the obtained results. The screening is accompanied by a nationwide information and education campaign carried out by means of new media.
Results: A total of 1,008 children and adolescents participated in the validation study. In outpatient examination AR was diagnosed in 46.4\% and BA in 11.2\%. In the case of AR, the sensitivity of the calibrated version of the algorithm was 0.852 and the specificity was 0.840. In the case of BA, it was 0.841 and 0.912, respectively. In 2017, 1,512 people used the screening tool, of which 1,472 respondents went through all stages of the assessment. BA positive AR result (probably sick) was found in 19.5\% of respondents and BA in 8.4\%.
Conclusions: The use of e-health tools in mass screening and new media to conduct information and education campaigns allows for the reduction of costs and for efficient implementation of activities. It is important to popularize the use of this type of solutions both at national and local level.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a telemedicine diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening program in rural Southern India that conducts 1-off screening camps (i.e., screening offered once) in villages and to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of different screening intervals.
DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis using a Markov model.
PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of 1000 rural diabetic patients aged 40 years who had not been previously screened for DR and who were followed over a 25-year period in Chennai, India.
METHODS: We interviewed 249 people with diabetes using the time trade-off method to estimate utility values associated with DR. Patient and provider costs of telemedicine screening and hospital-based DR treatment were estimated through interviews with 100 diabetic patients, sampled when attending screening in rural camps (n = 50) or treatment at the base hospital in Chennai (n = 50), and with program and hospital managers. The sensitivity and specificity of the DR screening test were assessed in comparison with diagnosis using a gold standard method for 346 diabetic patients. Other model parameters were derived from the literature. A Markov model was developed in TreeAge Pro 2009 (TreeAge Software Inc, Williamstown, MA) using these data.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the current teleophthalmology program of 1-off screening in comparison with no screening program and the cost-utility of this program at different screening intervals.
RESULTS: By using the World Health Organization threshold of cost-effectiveness, the current rural teleophthalmology program was cost-effective (\$1320 per QALY) compared with no screening from a health provider perspective. Screening intervals of up to a frequency of screening every 2 years also were cost-effective, but annual screening was not ({\textgreater}\$3183 per QALY). From a societal perspective, telescreening up to a frequency of once every 5 years was cost-effective, but not more frequently.
CONCLUSIONS: From a health provider perspective, a 1-off DR telescreening program is cost-effective compared with no screening in this rural Indian setting. Increasing the frequency of screening up to 2 years also is cost-effective. The results are dependent on the administrative costs of establishing and maintaining screening at regular intervals and on achieving sufficient coverage.},

	abstract = {Psychiatric care for nursing home residents is difficult to obtain, especially in rural areas, and this deficiency may lead to significant morbidity or death. Providing this service by videoconference may be a helpful, cost-effective, and acceptable alternative to face-to-face treatment. We analyzed data for 278 telepsychiatry encounters for 106 nursing home residents to estimate potential cost and time savings associated with this modality compared to in-person care. A total of 843.5 hours (105.4 8-hour work days) of travel time was saved compared to in-person consultation for each of the 278 encounters if they had occurred separately. If four resident visits were possible for each trip, the time saved would decrease to 26.4 workdays. Travel distance saved was 43,000 miles; 10,750 miles if four visits per trip occurred. More than \$3,700 would be spent on gasoline for 278 separate encounters; decreased to \$925 for four visits per roundtrip. Personnel cost savings estimates ranged from \$33,739 to \$67,477. Physician costs associated with additional travel time ranged from \$84,347 to \$253,040 for 278 encounters, or from \$21,087 to \$63,260 for four encounters per visit. The telepsychiatry approach was enthusiastically accepted by virtually all residents, family members, and nursing home personnel, and led to successful patient management. Providing psychiatric care to rural nursing home residents by videoconference is cost effective and appears to be a medically acceptable alternative to face-to-face care. In addition, this approach will allow many nursing homes to provide essential care that would not otherwise be available.},

Compared with the in-office visits, remote monitoring required less time from patients (6.9 +/- 5.0 vs. 182 +/- 148 min, P {\textless} 0.001) and physicians (8.4 +/- 4.5 vs. 25.8 +/- 17.0 min, P {\textless} 0.001) to complete the follow-up. Substitution of two routine in-office visits during the study by remote monitoring reduced the overall cost of routine ICD follow-up by 524 euro per patient (41\%).
CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring offers a safe, feasible, time-saving, and cost-effective solution to ICD follow-up.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether wearable heart rate (HR) sensors can be worn continuously in inpatient rehabilitation to assess cardiorespiratory training response. If feasible, these sensors offer a low-cost low-maintenance method for assessing HR response in this setting. We determined feasibility of wearable sensors for assessing HR response to daytime therapy activities in inpatient rehabilitation within a cardiorespiratory training zone equal to 55-80\% of maximal HR (target HR [THR]) for at least two 10-min bouts, 3-5 days per week. Secondarily, we determined episodes of excessive HR (EHR {\textgreater}80\% of maximal HR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects 44-80 years of age with diagnoses of stroke, cardiac disorders, orthopedic disorders, medically complex conditions, or pulmonary disorders wore wrist-mounted HR sensors day and night throughout inpatient rehabilitation. The proportion of subjects meeting THR thresholds and experiencing EHR episodes was quantified. Multiple regression predicted THR and EHR outcomes from age, sex, length of stay, and motor function at admission and discharge.
RESULTS: Across subjects, 97,800 min of HR data were analyzed. Sixty percent of subjects met THR thresholds for cardiorespiratory benefit. Age was the single significant predictor of percent of days meeting the THR threshold (R = 0.58, p = 0.024). Forty-seven percent of subjects experienced EHR episodes on at least 1 day. No subjects experienced sensor-related adverse events, and no protocol deviations occurred from inadvertent sensor removal.
CONCLUSIONS: Most subjects experienced HR increases sufficient to obtain cardiorespiratory benefit. Likewise, most subjects had episodes of EHR. Wearable sensors were feasible for continuously assessing HR response, suggesting expanded opportunity in inpatient rehabilitation research and treatment.},

	abstract = {Importance: Determining the perceived supply and potential demand for teleophthalmology in emergency departments could help mitigate coverage gaps in emergency ophthalmic care.
Objective: To evaluate the perceived current need for and availability of ophthalmologist coverage in California emergency departments and the potential effect of telemedicine for ophthalmology triage and consultation.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Surveys were remotely administered to 187 of the 254 emergency departments throughout California via the telephone and Internet from June 30 to September 23, 2014. Emergency department nurse managers and physicians from all emergency departments listed in the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development database were individually surveyed to assess facility characteristics and resources as well as the perceived usefulness of teleophthalmology consultation. Data analysis was conducted from June 30, 2014, to March 11, 2015.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Perceived availability of ophthalmology consultation coverage and perceived effect of telemedicine ophthalmology consultation at each facility.
Results: Of the 187 emergency departments surveyed, 18 of 37 rural facilities (48.6\%) reported availability of emergency ophthalmology coverage, compared with 112 of 150 nonrural facilities (74.7\%). Rural facilities reported a mean (SD) of 23.72 (14.15) miles between the facility and referral location, while nonrural facilities reported a mean of 4.41 (10.23) miles (19.3\% difference). On a scale of 1 to 5 (where 1 signifies very low value and 5 signifies very high value), 124 of 187 nurse managers (66.3\%) and 80 of 121 physicians (66.1\%) rated teleophthalmology as having high or very high value for triage purposes. The most frequently cited potential advantage of emergency teleophthalmology was assistance in patient triage and immediate real-time electronic communication, and the most frequently cited potential disadvantages were unknown cost of contracting and maintenance and concern that eye trauma might make photographs or videos less conclusive.
Conclusions and Relevance: Availability of ophthalmology coverage for emergency eye care is limited, particularly among rural emergency departments in California. Surveyed emergency department nurse managers and physicians indicated moderately high interest and perceived value for a teleophthalmology solution for remote triage and consultation. Overall, the study suggests that teleophthalmology could play a role in mitigating coverage gaps in emergency ophthalmic care and could be further investigated through similar studies in other regions.},

Methods We conducted a literature search in English and Arabic on peer-reviewed e-health research up to December 2014 originating in the GCC. The objective was to retrieve all research on e-health in the GCC and to categorize and analyse it qualitatively to reveal the current state of e-health research and development in the region. Inclusion criteria included peer-reviewed articles, books, book chapters, conference papers and graduate theses written on e-health in the GCC. Blogs, health websites and non-peer-reviewed literature were excluded. Results Three hundred and six articles were retrieved, categorized and analysed qualitatively to reveal the state of e-health research in the GCC. Both country-specific and GCC-wide major themes were identified using NVivo 10.0 qualitative software and summarized. The most common type of study was an overview (35.0\%), with common study designs of case studies (26.8\%) and descriptive articles (46.4\%). Significant themes were: prospective national benefits from e-health, implementation and satisfaction with electronic health records, online technologies in medical education, innovative systems (case studies), and information security and personal health information. Discussion This is the first comprehensive analytical literature review of e-health in the GCC. Important research gaps were identified: few cost-benefit analyses, controlled interventional studies, or research targeting gender and religious issues were retrieved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adoptions of health behaviors are crucial for maintaining good health after type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnoses. However, adherence to glucoregulating behaviors like regular exercise and balanced diet can be challenging, especially for people living in lower-socioeconomic status (SES) communities. Providing cost-effective interventions that improve self-management is important for improving quality of life and the sustainability of health care systems.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a health coach intervention with and without the use of mobile phones to support health behavior change in patients with type 2 diabetes.
METHODS: In this noninferiority, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT), patients from two primary care health centers in Toronto, Canada, with type 2 diabetes and a glycated hemoglobin/hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of ≥7.3\% (56.3 mmol/mol) were randomized to receive 6 months of health coaching with or without mobile phone monitoring support. We hypothesized that both approaches would result in significant HbA1c reductions, although health coaching with mobile phone monitoring would result in significantly larger effects. Participants were evaluated at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c from baseline to 6 months (difference between and within groups). Other outcomes included weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), satisfaction with life, depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), positive and negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS]), and quality of life (Short Form Health Survey-12 [SF-12]).
RESULTS: A total of 138 patients were randomized and 7 were excluded for a substudy; of the remaining 131, 67 were allocated to the intervention group and 64 to the control group. Primary outcome data were available for 97 participants (74.0\%). While both groups reduced their HbA1c levels, there were no significant between-group differences in change of HbA1c at 6 months using intention-to-treat (last observation carried forward [LOCF]) (P=.48) or per-protocol (P=.83) principles. However, the intervention group did achieve an accelerated HbA1c reduction, leading to a significant between-group difference at 3 months (P=.03). This difference was reduced at the 6-month follow-up as the control group continued to improve, achieving a reduction of 0.81\% (8.9 mmol/mol) (P=.001) compared with a reduction of 0.84\% (9.2 mmol/mol)(P=.001) in the intervention group. Intervention group participants also had significant decreases in weight (P=.006) and waist circumference (P=.01) while controls did not. Both groups reported improvements in mood, satisfaction with life, and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Health coaching with and without access to mobile technology appeared to improve glucoregulation and mental health in a lower-SES, T2DM population. The accelerated improvement in the mobile phone group suggests the connectivity provided may more quickly improve adoption and adherence to health behaviors within a clinical diabetes management program. Overall, health coaching in primary care appears to lead to significant benefits for patients from lower-SES communities with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trauma transfer patients routinely undergo repeat imaging because of inefficiencies within the radiology system. In 2009, the virtual private network (VPN) telemedicine system was adopted throughout Oregon allowing virtual image transfer between hospitals. The startup cost was a nominal \$3,000 per hospital.
METHODS: A retrospective review from 2007 to 2012 included 400 randomly selected adult trauma transfer patients based on a power analysis (200 pre/200 post). The primary outcome evaluated was reduction in repeat computed tomography (CT) scans. Secondary outcomes included cost savings, emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS), and spared radiation. All data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. P less than .05 indicated significance. Spared radiation was calculated as a weighted average per body region, and savings was calculated using charges obtained from Oregon Health and Science University radiology current procedural terminology codes.
RESULTS: Four-hundred patients were included. Injury Severity Score, age, ED and overall LOS, mortality, trauma type, and gender were not statistically different between groups. The percentage of patients with repeat CT scans decreased after VPN implementation: CT abdomen (13.2\% vs 2.8\%, P {\textless} .01) and cervical spine (34.4\% vs 18.2\%, P {\textless} .01). Post-VPN, the total charges saved in 2012 for trauma transfer patients was \$333,500, whereas the average radiation dose spared per person was 1.8 mSV. Length of stay in the ED for patients with Injury Severity Score less than 15 transferring to the ICU was decreased (P {\textless} .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a statewide teleradiology network resulted in fewer total repeat CT scans, significant savings, decrease in radiation exposure, and decreased LOS in the ED for patients with less complex injuries. The potential for health care savings by widespread adoption of a VPN is significant.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since its advent, telemedicine has facilitated access to subspecialty medical care for the treatment of patients in remote and austere settings. The United States military introduced a formal orthopaedic teleconsultation system in 2007, but few reports have explored its scope of practice and efficacy, particularly in a deployed environment during a time of conflict.
METHODS: All teleconsultations placed to the orthopaedic service between April 2009 and December 2012 were obtained and retrospectively reviewed. Case files were abstracted and anatomical location of injury, type of injury, origin of consult (country or Navy Afloat), branch of service, and treatment recommendations, were recorded for descriptive analysis. The final result of the consult was also determined, with service members transported from the combat theatre or deployment location defined as medically evacuated. Instances where teleconsultations averted a medical evacuation were also documented as a separate outcome.
RESULTS: Over a 32-month period, 597 orthopaedic teleconsultations were placed, with the majority derived from Army (46\%) and Navy (32\%) personnel deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, or with Navy Afloat. Approximately 51\% of consults involved the upper extremity, including 197 hand injuries, followed by lower extremity (37\%) and spine (7.8\%) complaints. Fractures comprised over half of all injuries, with the hand and foot most commonly affected. The average response time for teleconsultations was 7.54h. A total of 56 service members required immediate evacuation for further orthopaedic management, while at least 26 medical evacuations were prevented due to the teleconsultation system.
CONCLUSIONS: The teleconsultation system promotes early access to orthopaedic subspecialty care in a resource-limited, deployed military setting. The telemedicine network also appears to mitigate unnecessary aeromedical evacuations, reducing healthcare costs, lost duty time, and treatment delays. These findings have important meaning for the future of telemedicine in both the military and civilian setting.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Palliative care (PC) and palliative radiotherapy (RT) consultation are integral to the care of patients with advanced cancer. These services are not universally available in rural areas, and travel to urban centers to access them can be burdensome for patients and families. The objectives of our study were to assess the feasibility of using videoconferencing to provide specialist multidisciplinary PC and palliative RT consultation to cancer patients in rural areas and to explore symptom, cost, and satisfaction outcomes.
METHODS: The Virtual Pain and Symptom Control and Palliative Radiotherapy Clinic was piloted from January 2008 to March 2011. Cancer patients in rural northern Alberta attended local telehealth facilities, accompanied by nurses trained in symptom assessment. The multidisciplinary team at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton was linked by videoconference. Team recommendations were sent to the patients' family physicians. Data were collected on referral, clinical, and consultation characteristics and symptom, cost, and satisfaction outcomes.
RESULTS: Forty-four initial consultation and 28 follow-up visits took place. Mean Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale scores for anxiety and appetite were statistically significantly improved at the first follow-up visit (p {\textless} 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). Average per visit savings for patients seen by telehealth versus attending the CCI were 471.13 km, 7.96 hours, and Cdn \$192.71, respectively. Patients and referring physicians indicated a high degree of satisfaction with the clinic.
CONCLUSION: Delivery of specialist multidisciplinary PC consultation by videoconferencing is feasible, may improve symptoms, results in cost savings to patients and families, and is satisfactory to users.},

	abstract = {Introduction This study examined the effect of a telehealth intervention on the control of type 2 diabetes and subsequent potential cost-savings to the health system. Methods This prospective randomised controlled trial randomised adults with type 2 diabetes to the intervention (diabetes program) or control (usual care) arm. Key eligibility criteria included an HbA1c level of at least 58 mmol/mol (7.5\%) without severe or unstable comorbidities. All participants continued their usual healthcare, but participants in the intervention arm received additional diabetes care from a diabetes care coordinator via a home monitor that captured clinical measures. Data collected included biomedical, quality of life measures and healthcare (GP, outpatient and inpatient) costs. The primary outcome was HbA1c collected at baseline and 6 months. Analysis was conducted on a complete case intention-to-treat basis. The healthcare system perspective was taken to calculate the incremental cost per percentage-point reduction in HbA1c. Results Results from 63 participants from each study arm were analysed. HbA1c in the intervention group decreased from a median 68 mmol/mol (8.4\%) to 58 mmol/mol (7.5\%), and remained unchanged in the control group at median 65 mmol/mol (8.1\%) at the 6-month endpoint. The intervention effect on HbA1c change was statistically significant ( p = .004). Total healthcare costs in the intervention group, including the intervention costs, were lower (mean \$3781 vs. \$4662; p {\textless} .001) compared with usual care. Discussion There was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant benefit from the telehealth intervention at a lower cost; thus, telehealth was cost-saving and produced greater health benefits compared with usual care.},

	abstract = {Background: Blood pressure (BP) is a key modifiable risk factor for patients with CKD, with current guidelines recommending strict control to reduce the risk of both progression of CKD and cardiovascular disease. Trials of BP lowering require multiple visits to achieve target BP which increases the costs of such trials, and in routine care BP measured in clinic may not accurately reflect usual BP.
Objective: We sought to assess whether a telemonitoring system for BP (using a Bluetooth-enable BP machine which could transmit BP measurements to a tablet device which had a bespoke app to guide measurement of BP and collect questionnaire data) was acceptable to patients with CKD, and whether patients would provide sufficient BP readings to assess variability and guide treatment.
Methods: 25 participants with CKD were trained to use the telemonitoring equipment, asked to record BP daily for 30 days, attend a study visit, and then record BP on alternate days for the next 60 days. They were also offered a wrist-worn applanation tonometry device (BPro) which measures BP every 15 minutes over a 24 hour period.Participants were given questionnaires at the one-month and three-month time points, derived from the System Usability Scale and Technology Acceptance Model. All eligible participants completed the study.
Results: Mean age was 58 (SD 11) years and mean eGFR was 36 (SD 13) mL/min/1.73m2. 13 out of 25 (52\%) participants provided {\textgreater}90\% of expected data and 18 out of 25 (72\%) provided {\textgreater}80\% expected data. The usability of the telemonitoring system was rated highly with mean scores of 84.9/100 (SE 2.8) after 30 days and 84.2/100 (SE 4.1) after 90 days. The coefficient of variation (CV) for variability of telemonitoring systolic BP was 9.4\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 7.8 to 10.9), compared to 7.9\% (95\% CI 6.4-9.5) for the BPro device (P=0.05) (and 9.0\% over one year in a recently completed trial with identical eligibility criteria), indicating that most variation in BP is short-term.
Conclusions: Telemonitoring is acceptable to patients with CKD and provides sufficient data to inform titration of antihypertensive therapies in either a randomized trial setting (comparing different targets BPs) or routine clinical practice. Such methods could be employed in both scenarios and reduce costs currently associated with such activities.Registration ISRCTN13725286.},

METHODS: In-depth, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 17 rural adult survivors recruited from the Utah Cancer Registry. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and content analyzed with NVivo 9 by two coders (kappa = 0.93).
RESULTS: Two primary themes emerged: (1) concerns about health care quality and (2) geographic and insurance issues. Within these main themes, we identified salient sub-themes: quality of primary care, patient-provider trust, specialty care access, travel burdens, and financial and insurance concerns.
CONCLUSIONS: Rural childhood cancer survivors have concerns about local health care services, but are willing to travel several hours to receive care. Partnerships between local primary care and cancer specialty providers via telemedicine that incorporate survivor care plans could improve risk-based care for rural survivors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemonitoring has shown promise for alleviating the burden of heart failure on individuals and health systems. However, real-world implementation of sustained programs is rare.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a mobile phone-based telemonitoring program, which has been implemented as part of standard care in a specialty heart function clinic by answering two research questions: (1) To what extent was the telemonitoring program successfully implemented? (2) What were the barriers and facilitators to implementing the telemonitoring program?
METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal single case study. The implementation success was evaluated using the following four implementation outcomes: adoption, penetration, feasibility, and fidelity. Semistructured interviews based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) were conducted at 0, 4, and 12 months with 12 program staff members to identify the barriers and facilitators of the implementation.
RESULTS: One year after the implementation, 98 patients and 8 clinicians were enrolled in the program. Despite minor technical issues, the intervention was used as intended. We obtained qualitative data from clinicians (n=8) and implementation staff members (n=4) for 24 CFIR constructs. A total of 12 constructs were facilitators clustered in the CFIR domains of inner setting (culture, tension for change, compatibility, relative priority, learning climate, leadership engagement, and available resources), characteristics of individuals (knowledge and beliefs about the intervention and self-efficacy), and process (engaging and reflecting and evaluating). In addition, we identified other notable facilitators from the characteristics of the intervention domain (relative advantage and adaptability) and the outer setting (patient needs and resources). Four constructs were perceived as minor barriers- the complexity of the intervention, cost, inadequate communication among high-level stakeholders, and the absence of a formal implementation plan. The remaining CFIR constructs had a neutral impact on the overall implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive evaluation of the implementation of a mobile phone-based telemonitoring program. Although the acceptability of the telemonitoring system was high, the strongest facilitators to the implementation success were related to the implementation context. By identifying what works and what does not in a real-world clinical context using a framework-guided approach, this work will inform the design of telemonitoring services and implementation strategies of similar telemonitoring interventions.},

In a sample of nineteen hospitals, coverage schedules in 2016 showed that seven had begun the use of tele-ED physician backup for advanced practice providers, decreasing local physician coverage in their EDs. These seven hospitals tended to have decreasing ED staffing costs, while the hospitals not applying this policy showed continually increasing staffing costs over time. Telemedicine also provided other benefits, such as improved physician recruitment and retention. In the future, more critical access hospitals will likely use telemedicine to provide physician backup for advanced practice providers staffing the ED.},

	abstract = {Wireless telemedicine using GSM and GPRS technologies can only provide low bandwidth connections, which makes it difficult to transmit images and video. Satellite or 3G wireless transmission provides greater bandwidth, but the running costs are high. Wireless networks (WLANs) appear promising, since they can supply high bandwidth at low cost. However, the WLAN technology has limitations, such as coverage. A new wireless networking technology named the wireless mesh network (WMN) overcomes some of the limitations of the WLAN. A WMN combines the characteristics of both a WLAN and ad hoc networks, thus forming an intelligent, large scale and broadband wireless network. These features are attractive for telemedicine and telecare because of the ability to provide data, voice and video communications over a large area. One successful wireless telemedicine project which uses wireless mesh technology is the Emergency Room Link (ER-LINK) in Tucson, Arizona, USA. There are three key characteristics of a WMN: self-organization, including self-management and self-healing; dynamic changes in network topology; and scalability. What we may now see is a shift from mobile communication and satellite systems for wireless telemedicine to the use of wireless networks based on mesh technology, since the latter are very attractive in terms of cost, reliability and speed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Half of patients with hypertension have poor blood pressure (BP) control. Recent models for treating hypertension have integrated disease monitoring and telephone-based interventions delivered in patients' homes. This study evaluated the costs of the Hypertension Intervention Nurse Telemedicine Study (HINTS), aimed to improve BP control in veterans.
METHODS: Eligible veterans were randomized to either usual care or 1 of 3 telephone-based intervention groups using home BP telemonitoring: (1) behavioral management, (2) medication management, or (3) combined. Intervention costs were derived from information collected during the trial. Direct medical costs (inpatient, outpatient, and outpatient pharmacy, including hypertension-specific pharmacy) at 18 months by group were calculated using Veterans Affairs (VA) Decision Support System data. Bootstrapped CIs were computed to compare intervention and medical costs between intervention groups and usual care.
RESULTS: Patients receiving behavior or medication management showed significant gains in BP control at 12 months; there were no differences in BP control at 18 months. In subgroup analysis, patients with poor baseline BP control receiving combined intervention significantly improved BP at 12 and 18 months. In overall and subgroup samples, average intervention costs were similar in the 3 study arms, and at 18 months, there were no statistically significant differences in direct VA medical costs or total VA costs between treatment arms and usual care.
CONCLUSIONS: To optimize investment in telephone-based home interventions such as the HINTS, it is important to identify groups of patients who are most likely to benefit from more intensive home BP management.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The imbalance in healthcare between urban and rural areas is still a problem in China. In recent decades, China has aimed to develop telemedicine. We assessed the implementation, utilization, and cost-effectiveness of a large telemedicine program across western China.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2002-2013, a government-sponsored major telemedicine program was established by West China Hospital of Sichuan University (hub), covering 249 spoke hospitals in 112 cities throughout western China and in 40 medical expertise areas. We analyzed the cross-sectional data from 11,987 consultations conducted at West China Hospital using the telemedicine network over a 12-year period. The types of diseases as well as the diagnosis and treatment changes were assessed. We also performed a cost-savings analysis and a one-way sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 11,987 teleconsultations, we noted that neoplasms (19.4\%), injuries (13.9\%), and circulatory diseases (10.3\%) were the three most common diagnoses. Teleconsultations resulted in a change of diagnosis in 4,772 (39.8\%) patients, and 3,707 (77.7\%) of them underwent major diagnosis changes. Moreover, it led to a change of treatment in 6,591 (55.0\%) patients, including 3,677 (55.8\%) changes not linked to diagnosis changes. The telemedicine network resulted in an estimated net saving of \$2,364,525 (if the patients traveled to the hub) or \$3,759,014 (if the specialists traveled to the spoke hospitals).
CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of telemedicine in China, linking highly specialized major hospitals (hub) with hundreds of small rural hospitals (spoke), can greatly improve the quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of healthcare delivery and utilization. This new Internet-based healthcare model should be utilized more widely in developing countries.},

DESIGN: A retrospective analysis.
PARTICIPANTS: Premature newborns requiring ROP screening at 6 neonatal intensive care units from December 1, 2005, to November 30, 2011.
METHODS: Infants were evaluated via remote retinal photography by an ROP specialist. A total of 608 preterm infants meeting ROP examination criteria were screened with the RetCam II/III (Clarity Medical Systems, Pleasanton, Calif.). Primary outcomes were treatment-warranted ROP (TW-ROP) and adverse anatomical events.
RESULTS: During the 6 years, 1216 total eyes were screened during 2169 examinations, generating 26 970 retinal images, an average of 3.56 examinations and 44.28 images per patient. Twenty-two (3.6\%) of the infants screened met criteria for TW-ROP. Compared with bedside binocular ophthalmoscopy, remote interpretation of RetCam II/III images had a sensitivity of 100\%, specificity of 99.8\%, positive predicative value of 95.5\%, and negative predicative value of 100\% for the detection of TW-ROP. No adverse anatomical outcomes were observed for any enrolled patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The 6-year results for the SUNDROP telemedicine initiative were highly favourable with respect to diagnostic accuracy. Telemedicine appears to be a safe, reliable, and cost-effective complement to the efforts of ROP specialists, capable of increasing patient access to screening and focusing the resources of the current ophthalmic community on infants with potentially vision-threatening disease.},

	abstract = {Telemedicine and the medical "big data" era in ophthalmology highlight the use of non-mydriatic ocular fundus photography, which has given rise to indispensable applications of portable fundus cameras. However, in the case of portable fundus photography, non-mydriatic image quality is more vulnerable to distortions, such as uneven illumination, color distortion, blur, and low contrast. Such distortions are called generic quality distortions. This paper proposes an algorithm capable of selecting images of fair generic quality that would be especially useful to assist inexperienced individuals in collecting meaningful and interpretable data with consistency. The algorithm is based on three characteristics of the human visual system--multi-channel sensation, just noticeable blur, and the contrast sensitivity function to detect illumination and color distortion, blur, and low contrast distortion, respectively. A total of 536 retinal images, 280 from proprietary databases and 256 from public databases, were graded independently by one senior and two junior ophthalmologists, such that three partial measures of quality and generic overall quality were classified into two categories. Binary classification was implemented by the support vector machine and the decision tree, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained and plotted to analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results revealed that the generic overall quality classification achieved a sensitivity of 87.45\% at a specificity of 91.66\%, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.9452, indicating the value of applying the algorithm, which is based on the human vision system, to assess the image quality of non-mydriatic photography, especially for low-cost ophthalmological telemedicine applications.},

Empirical evidence indicated that a 10\% increase in the cost of each conventional health service increased the population life expectancy at birth by 0.12\%. A 10\% increase in gross domestic product per capita or the income level of the country increased the population's life expectancy at birth by 0.0023\%. A 10\% increase in population increased the population's life expectancy at birth by 0.0004\%. A 10\% increase in the ratio of telehealth services relative to conventional medical services increased the population's life expectancy at birth by 0.00019\%. Interestingly, the cost of each telehealth service does not influence the population's health status. Furthermore, to reach the longevity at 76.25 years that is the current population's life expectancy at birth, an increase in health services via the telecommunications system of 243 times is able to reduce the cost of conventional health services by 69.5\%. Accordingly, the cost of telehealth services does not play a deterministic role for guiding medical resource allocation and the provision of telemedicine is able to effectively save medical resources.},

Regression analysis is undertaken and an ordinary least-squares method is applied. A panel dataset consists of a national sample over the period from 1995 to 2004. Empirical evidences show that increases in gross domestic product (GDP) increase the reported demand for telemedicine, but the price (cost) of telemedicine reduces that demand. In contrast, the price of conventional medical care and the indicator of healthcare environment (per capita national health expenditure) have no impact on the demand for telemedicine. The study provides quantitative estimates of the impact of GDP and telemedicine prices on the reported demand for telemedicine. A 10\% increase in GDP increases the demand for telemedicine services by 3.9\%. A 10\% increase in the price of telemedicine reduces the demand for telemedicine by 7.4\%. Furthermore, Taiwan's current GDP is used to estimate the unmet demand for telemedicine. The estimated current unmet demand for telemedicine is more than three times that currently being provided. In a well-run tele-healthcare system, the residents' capacities to generate income result in their health status being enhanced. Eventually, the economy will enjoy a higher level of welfare due to the impact of health and the provision of telemedicine. This is possibly a much more important source of economic performance and is derived from a policy aimed at promoting telemedicine.},

	abstract = {Visual images can enhance communication over a distance. In the UK, plastic surgery provides services over large distances by a 'hub and spoke' model. Telemedicine could help to increase the efficiency of service for plastic surgery patients. Telemedicine, along with the impending Electronic Patient Record system could combine to improve communication, patient triage, record keeping, audit and could lead to a better quality of clinical care. Another benefit could be significant cost savings. We report our experience of the introduction of telemedicine to a Regional Plastic Surgery Service. Our first study compared assessments from images and patient examinations, which gave us confidence in the use of images [Jones SM, Milroy C, Pickford MA. Telemedicine in acute plastic surgical trauma and burns. Ann R Coll Surg Engl 2004;86:239-42]. We proceeded to a 10-week evaluation of all 973 referrals to our unit. We found that the system was used for a wide variety of injuries and for 42\% of the 452 patients where the system was available. Initial resistance was overcome by the ease of use of the system, with both receiving and referring clinicians reporting benefits. The third phase was a 12-week prospective cohort study of 996 patients comparing the referrals with and without the telemedicine system. The system was available for 389 patients, and used for 243 patients (63\%). The groups were analysed by a chi squared test and confidence interval calculation. We demonstrated a significant difference in the initial management of patients, with 10\% more being booked directly to our Day Surgery Unit. There was a decrease in number of occasions when we were unable to accept a patient due to a lack of capacity. We found no change in the patients being managed with telephone only advice. We found that telemedicine is a valuable method of providing useful preliminary information in the referral process for injured patients and often significantly modifies their treatment and/or management plan. This has implications for the use of Information Technology resources and potentially the delivery of healthcare in relation to the management of injured patients.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of home monitoring of lung mechanics by the forced oscillation technique and cardiac parameters in older patients with COPD and comorbidities.
METHODS: This multicenter, randomized clinical trial recruited 312 patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease grades II to IV COPD (median age, 71 yr [interquartile range, 66-76 yr]; 49.6\% grade II, 50.4\% grades III-IV), with a history of exacerbation in the previous year and at least one nonpulmonary comorbidity. Patients were randomized to usual care (n = 158) or telemonitoring (n = 154) and followed for 9 months. All telemonitoring patients self-assessed lung mechanics daily, and in a subgroup with congestive heart failure (n = 37) cardiac parameters were also monitored. An algorithm identified deterioration, triggering a telephone contact to determine appropriate interventions.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcomes were time to first hospitalization (TTFH) and change in the EuroQoL EQ-5D utility index score. Secondary outcomes included: rate of antibiotic/corticosteroid prescription; hospitalization; the COPD Assessment Tool, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire scores; quality-adjusted life years; and healthcare costs. Telemonitoring did not affect TTFH, EQ-5D utility index score, antibiotic prescriptions, hospitalization rate, or questionnaire scores. In an exploratory analysis, telemedicine was associated with fewer repeat hospitalizations (-54\%; P = 0.017).
CONCLUSIONS: In older patients with COPD and comorbidities, remote monitoring of lung function by forced oscillation technique and cardiac parameters did not change TTFH and EQ-5D. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01960907).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical benefit of helicopter transport over ground transportation for interfacility transport is unproven. We sought to determine actual practice patterns, utilization, and outcomes of patients undergoing interfacility transport for neurosurgical conditions.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We retrospectively examined all interfacility helicopter transfers to a single trauma center during 2008. We restricted our analysis to those transfers leading either to admission to the neurosurgical service or to formal consultation upon arrival. Major exclusion criteria included transport from the scene, death during transport, and transport to any area of the hospital other than the emergency department. The primary outcome was time interval to invasive intervention. Secondary outcomes were estimated ground transportation times from the referring hospital, admitting disposition, and discharge disposition. Of 526 candidate interfacility helicopter transfers to our emergency department in 2008, we identified 167 meeting study criteria. Seventy-five (45\%) of these patients underwent neurosurgical intervention. The median time to neurosurgical intervention ranged from 1.0 to 117.8 hours, varying depending on the diagnosis. For 101 (60\%) of the patients, estimated driving time from the referring institution was less than one hour. Four patients (2\%) expired in the emergency department, and 34 patients (20\%) were admitted to a non-ICU setting. Six patients were discharged home within 24 hours. For those admitted, in-hospital mortality was 28\%.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Many patients undergoing interfacility transfer for neurosurgical evaluation are inappropriately triaged to helicopter transport, as evidenced by actual times to intervention at the accepting institution and estimated ground transportation times from the referring institution. In a time when there is growing interest in health care cost containment, practitioners must exercise discretion in the selection of patients for air ambulance transport--particularly when it may not bear influence on clinical outcome. Neurosurgical evaluation via telemedicine may be one strategy for improving air transport triage.},

Patients at a Midwestern Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center were randomized to telephone, videophone, or usual care for follow-up care after hospitalization for heart failure exacerbation. Outcome measures included readmission rates; time to first readmission; urgent care clinic visits; survival; and quality of life. The intervention resulted in a significantly longer time to readmission but had no effect on readmission rates or mortality. There were no differences in hospital days or urgent care clinic use. All subjects reported higher disease-specific quality of life scores at 1 year. There was evidence of the value of telephone follow-up, but there was no evidence to support the benefit of videophone care over telephone care. Rigorous evaluation is needed to determine which patients may benefit most from specific telehealth applications and which technologies are most cost-effective.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the percentage of new and follow-up visits conducted via TeleAllergy in a hospital-based clinic.
METHODS: A retrospective study evaluating the first 2 years of a synchronous patient-to-allergist TeleAllergy platform.
RESULTS: A total of 112 synchronous TeleAllergy encounters were conducted from January 2014 through December 2015; 66 (59\%) of these were new consultations. The mean (SD) age was 26.9 (15.3) years, and 54\% of the participants were female. Food allergy (30\%), allergic rhinitis (20\%), and urticaria (16\%) represented the top 3 consultation reasons. Sixteen of 66 patients (24.2\%) and 3 of 46 patients (6.5\%) attending new and follow-up TeleAllergy visits, respectively, were recommended for an in-person appointment (P = .02). No difference was found between new and follow-up TeleAllergy visits regarding subsequent telephone communication (41\% vs 26\%, P = .11) or prescriptions ordered (50\% vs 33\%, P = .08). New TeleAllergy visits were more likely to have more than 1 laboratory test ordered (45\% vs 17\%, P = .002). On the basis of patient location, the 112 TeleAllergy visits resulted in an estimated savings of 200 workdays or schooldays, US\$58,000 in travel-related costs, and 80,000 kilometers not driven.
CONCLUSION: Both new and follow-up visits to the allergist/immunologist were well received by patients and demonstrated significant indirect cost savings, with less than one fourth of the patients recommended for an in-person visit. This appears to be the first systematic assessment of TeleAllergy for new and follow-up patient encounters in a clinic-based allergy/immunology practice.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the percentage of new and follow-up visits conducted via synchronous telemedicine requiring an in-person visit.
METHODS: A retrospective review evaluating synchronous tele-allergy appointments in a hospital-based allergy clinic was performed.
RESULTS: A total of 360 unique patients participated in 423 synchronous tele-allergy visits from January 2016 to December 2017; 275 (65.0\%) were new consultations, 54\% were males, and 118 (28\%) visits were for children. Allergic rhinitis (35\%), asthma (24\%), and food allergy (10\%) represented the top 3 diagnoses. New and follow-up tele-allergy visits accounted for 13.1\% (275 of 2097) and 10.4\% (148 of 1426) of all outpatient visits during the study period, respectively. Sixty-five (23.4\%) new patients and 14 (9.5\%) follow-up patients were recommended for an in-person appointment (P {\textless} .001). Compared with follow-up tele-allergy visits, new visits were more likely to have medication prescribed (64.4\% vs 49.0\%; P {\textless} .002) and laboratory tests ordered (46.2\% vs 7.4\%; P {\textless} .001); there were no differences between new and follow-up tele-allergy visits for mean study observation period (P = .680), subsequent in-person visits conducted on the basis of provider recommendation (P = .120), or telephone consultations (P = .190). One hundred forty (33.1\%) patients completed an anonymous satisfaction survey, with 98.8\% of patients recommending telehealth and reporting high satisfaction. On the basis of 423 visits from 13 originating sites, patients saved an average of \$485 in travel expenses, 438 driving miles, and 2.3 days of work or school per visit.
CONCLUSIONS: Coupled with high patient satisfaction and significant time and cost savings, tele-allergy supported most of the new and follow-up visits without an in-person recommendation. Although not all tele-allergy efforts incorporate a synchronous modality with a dedicated patient presenter, allergists should continue to seek opportunities to incorporate synchronous tele-allergy with a trained patient presenter into their clinical practice.},

Finally, we aim to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions.
METHODS: A three-arm parallel randomized trial will be conducted. Arm 1 consists of usual care; arm 2 consists of usual care plus the HFM website; and arm 3 is the adjusted care pathway with an interactive platform for disease management (e-Vita platform), with a link to the HFM website, which replaces routine consultations with HF nurses at the outpatient clinic. In total, 414 patients managed in 10 Dutch HF outpatient clinics or in general practice will be included and followed for 12 months. Participants are included if they have had an established diagnosis of HF for at least 3 months. The primary outcome is self-care as measured by the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale (EHFScB scale). Secondary outcomes are quality of life, cardiovascular- and HF-related mortality, hospitalization, and its duration as captured by hospital and general practitioner registries, use of and user satisfaction with the HFM website, and cost-effectiveness.
PERSPECTIVE: This study will provide important prospective data on the impact and cost-effectiveness of an interactive platform for disease management and the HFM website.

Telehealth is a promising alternative delivery method for improving implementation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a telehealth service delivering direct observation, compared to an in-person drive-around service.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The study was conducted within a community nursing service in South Australia. Telehealth patients received daily video calls at home on a desktop videophone provided by the nursing call center. A retrospective cohort study assessed the effectiveness of the telehealth and traditional forms of observation, defined by the proportion of missed observations recorded in case notes. This data was inputted to a model, estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of telehealth. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with current patients, community nursing and Chest Clinic staff, concerning service acceptability, usability and sustainability. The percentage of missed observations for the telehealth service was 12.1 (n = 58), compared to 31.1 for the in-person service (n = 70). Most of the difference of 18.9\% (95\% CI: 12.2 - 25.4) was due to fewer pre-arranged absences. The economic analysis calculated the ICER to be AUD\$1.32 (95\% CI: \$0.51 - \$2.26) per extra day of successful observation. The video service used less staff time, and became dominant if implemented on a larger scale and/or with decreased technology costs. Qualitative analysis found enabling factors of flexible timing, high patient acceptance, staff efficiency, and Chest Clinic support. Substantial technical problems were manageable, and improved liaison between the nursing service and Chest Clinic was an unexpected side-benefit.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Home video observation is a patient-centered, resource efficient way of delivering direct observation for TB, and is cost-effective when compared with a drive-around service. Future research is recommended to determine applicability and effectiveness in other settings.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a telehealth system, using digital pen-and-paper technology and a modified smartphone, to remotely monitor and support the effectiveness of wound management in nursing home residents.
METHOD: A randomised controlled pilot study was conducted in selected nursing homes in Bradford, which were randomised to either the control or evaluation group. All patients with a wound of any aetiology or severity, resident in the selected nursing homes were considered eligible to participate in the study. Residents in the control homes who had, or developed, a wound during the study period, continued to receive unsupported care directed by the nursing home staff (defined as 'standard care'), while those in the evaluation homes received standard care supported by input from the remote experts.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with a wound were identified in the 16 participating Bradford nursing homes. Analysis of individual patient management pathways suggested that the system provided improved patient outcomes and that it may offer cost savings by improving dressing product selection, decreasing inappropriate onward referral and speeding healing. Despite initial anxiety related to the technology most nursing-home staff found the system of value and many were keen to see the trial continue to form part of routine patient management.
CONCLUSION: The current study supports the potential value of telemedicine in wound care and indicates the value that such a system may have to nursing-home staff and patients.

In 2010, we established a real-time nonrobotic telepathology system in a very active cancer center for daily frozen section service. Herein, we evaluate its accuracy compared to direct microscopic interpretation performed in the main hospital by the same faculty and its cost-efficiency over a 1-year period. From 643 (1,416 parts) cases requiring intraoperative consultation, 333 cases (690 parts) were examined by telepathology and 310 cases (726 parts) by direct microscopy. Corresponding discrepancy rates were 2.6\% (18 cases: 6 [0.9\%] sampling and 12 [1.7\%] diagnostic errors) and 3.2\% (23 cases: 8 [1.1\%] sampling and 15 [2.1\%] diagnostic errors), P = .63. The sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative frozen diagnosis were 0.92 and 0.99, respectively, in telepathology and 0.90 and 0.99, respectively, in direct microscopy. There was no correlation of error incidence with postgraduate year level of residents involved in the telepathology service. Cost analysis indicated that the time saved by telepathology was \$19,691.00 over 1 year of the study period, whereas the capital cost for establishing the system was \$8,924.00. Thus, real-time nonrobotic telepathology is a reliable and easy-to-use tool for frozen section evaluation in busy clinical settings, especially when frozen section service involves more than one hospital, and it is cost-efficient when travel is a component of the service.},

The resulting preventable disease complications and emergencies and reduction of consequences of disease are very important advantages for the patients, causing relief for medical staff and, thus, offer an enormous potential for improvements and cost savings in healthcare systems.},

Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients and counselors to assess acceptability. Of the 20 male patients randomized to telephone, 90\% received counseling and provided outcomes; of the 18 randomized to televideo, 67\% received counseling and 50\% provided outcomes. Telephone patients answered a mean of 4.4 of eight questions correctly at baseline and 4.7 at follow-up; televideo means were 5.6 and 6.5, respectively. Satisfaction was 25.2 out of 30 for telephone and 26.9 for televideo. Televideo patients incurred a median of 2.8 h of travel time, 40 roundtrip miles, and \$67.29 in costs. Patients and counselors found both modes acceptable for providing education and answering questions. Although patients liked the flexibility of telephone, counselors felt patients missed more appointments and were distracted when using telephone. A noted advantage of videoconferencing was reading body language. Further evaluation of alternative delivery modes is needed.},

Strict monitoring and care have been recommended. The aim of the present study was to primarily evaluate reduction in hospitalisations and, secondly, exacerbations, general practitioner (GP) calls and related cost-effectiveness of tele-assistance (TA) for these patients. A total of 240 patients (101 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) were randomised to two groups: an intervention group entered a 1-yr TA programme while controls received traditional care. No anthropometric and clinical differences were found between groups both in baseline and in mortality (18\% for TA, 23\% for controls). Compared with controls, the TA group experienced significantly fewer hospitalisations (-36\%), urgent GP calls (-65\%) and acute exacerbations (-71\%). Only COPD patients, as a separate group, had fewer hospitalisations, emergency room admissions, urgent GP calls or exacerbations. Each patient referred to staff a mean+/-sd 36+/-25 times. After deduction of TA costs, the average overall cost for each patient was 33\% less than that for usual care. In chronic respiratory failure patients on oxygen or home mechanical ventilation, a nurse-centred tele-assistance prevents hospitalisations while it is cost-effective. The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease group seems to have a greater advantage from tele-assistance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The issue of how to optimize the routine use of tele-assistance (TA) in the clinical care remains to be addressed. Skills and costs of human resources represent the major component to care for chronic patients with TA.
METHODS: We investigated (1) the change in patient population, mortality, and staff utilization/cost during the first 5-year activity of a TA program (24-h availability of a call center, pulse oxygen device, and second medical opinion) dedicated to chronic respiratory failure patients and (2) the staff time dedicated to each new patient admitted to the service.
RESULTS: Three-hundred and ninety-six patients (age 64 +/- 17 years; 296 men) were reviewed across 5 years of activity. Patients followed/year increased over time, particularly for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis subjects. Calls/month dramatically increased from 60 to 290, with a 5-year number of calls equal to 12.952. The doctor's time dedicated to TA decreased over time, whereas the nurse's time increased allowing a cost saving of 39\% when compared with budgeted salary costs. The number of home ventilated patients did not change, remaining over 78\%. The mortality rate increased over time (from 6\% to 11\%). Both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and No-COPD patients used the TA service more frequently during the winter, and COPD used it also in the summer.
CONCLUSIONS: A stable TA service dedicated to chronic respiratory failure may be reached after 4 years. Across years, (1) number of patients increased, with COPD and ventilated subjects being the most representative; (2) calls varied during seasons; (3) doctor's workload decreased, saving salary costs; and (4) each new enrolled patient may require 73 and 27 min/month of nurse and doctor, respectively.},

METHOD: 73 ALS patients after hospital discharge were followed up on voice by phone calls conducted by a nurse through a clinical card which was tested for feasibility, efficacy and utility. Number of patients simultaneously assisted/month, calls/patient, fixed and variable costs were calculated.
RESULTS: Time between disease's diagnosis and the beginning of tele-assistance was 720 ± 971 days. ALS patients' percentage managed by nurses through tele-assistance increased over time by 628\%. Tele-assistance integrated care (TAIC) followed up patients with a total of 5073 telephone calls. Steady state activity was reached at the 3rd year employing 5 ± 3 calls/pt/month (time/call 64 ± 44 min). Implementing the card was feasible, useful and effective by operator. Survival from diagnosis of ALS was 1224 ± 1150 days. Survival was related to tracheotomy.
CONCLUSION: TAIC is a feasible tool to manage up to 25 ALS patients/month/nurse and costs about €105.00 per patient per month. Tele-assistance is proposed at 2/3 of time course of the disease.},

Strategies to prevent occurrence of unreported COPD exacerbations are needed. We evaluated (1) comparison between administration of Respicard by the nurse during phone calls with self-administration by the patient and (2) patient compliance with Respicard use.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From January to June 2011, every week for 6 months, patients with COPD enrolled in a tele-assistance program in Italy were invited to fill in Respicard at home according to their symptoms. Concurrently, on a weekly basis, a nurse telephoned the patients and filled in a similar card. The scoring of both Respicards was compared. At the end of the study, the patient's subjective utility and ease in implementing or discomfort in recording Respicard was assessed.
RESULTS: In the 39 patients studied, the mean value of recorded nurse cards was 3.7±2.9, and the mean time spent by nurses to measure the first 52 cards was 7.7±2.7 min. Patient compliance was 78.2±33.4\%. There was a significant positive correlation between nurse and patient card scores (R=0.98; p{\textless}0.0001). A similar correlation was observed when data from patients with or without exacerbations and with high or poor adherence to the program were considered (p{\textless}0.0001). Patients' acceptance of the self-recording was good.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COPD with sufficient self-autonomy and followed up with tele-assistance, Respicard is a reliable system for recording symptoms of COPD and could be a good cost-cutting modality for continuing management of patients.},

	abstract = {Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has become a topical subject and can be applied in a variety of ways with differing outcomes. The cost of all diagnostic procedures including obstetric ultrasound examinations is a major factor in the developing world and POCUS is only useful if it can be equated to good outcomes at a lower cost than a routine obstetric examination. The aim of this study was to assess a number of processes including accuracy of images and reports generated by midwives, performance of a tablet-sized ultrasound scanner, training of midwives to complete ultrasounds, teleradiology solution transmissions of images via internet, review of images by a radiologist, communication between midwife and radiologist, use of this technique to identify high-risk patients and improvement of the education and teleradiology model components. The midwives had no previous experience in ultrasound. They were stationed in rural locations where POCUS was available for the first time. After scanning the patients, an interim report was generated by the midwives and sent electronically together with all images to the main hospital for validation. Unique software was used to send lossless images by mobile phone using a modem. Transmission times were short and quality of images transmitted was excellent. All reports were validated by two experienced radiologists in our department and returned to the centers using the same transmission software. The transmission times, quality of scans, quality of reports and other parameters were recorded and monitored. Analysis showed excellent correlation between provisional and validated reports. Reporting accuracy of scans performed by the midwives was 99.63\%. Overall flow turnaround time (from patient presentation to validated report) was initially 35 min but reduced to 25 min. The unique mobile phone transmission was faultless and there was no degradation of image quality. We found excellent correlation between final outcomes of the pregnancies and diagnoses on the basis of reports generated by the midwives. Only 1 discrepancy was found in the midwives' reports. Scan results versus actual outcomes revealed 2 discrepancies in the 20 patients identified as high risk. In conclusion, we found that it is valuable to train midwives in POCUS to use an ultrasound tablet device and transmit images and reports via the internet to radiologists for review of accuracy. This focus on the identification of high-risk patients can be valuable in a remote healthcare facility.},

This report describes the case of a 33-year-old woman who experienced the gradual development of a severe mandibular deformity with elongation of the chin and mandibular border because of fibrous dysplasia. Consequently, 19 cm of the mandible extending from the neck of the condyle to the contralateral body was resected together with vestibular and lingual deformities. This bone was replaced with a fibula-free flap. For planning, a virtual resection was performed via a Web conference, followed by virtual reconstruction by superimposition of the fibula on the mandibular defect after the creation of three osteotomies. A stereolithographic model of the reconstructed mandible and cutting guides for the mandibular resection and fibula osteotomies were made. The stereolithographic model of the neo-mandible allowed prebending of a reconstruction plate before the surgery because the deformity did not allow this to be performed intraoperatively. The cutting guides shortened the operating time and enabled accurate reproduction of the virtual plan with exact bone-to-bone contact in the reconstructed mandible. Surgical virtual planning, despite its upfront cost, is a time-saving procedure, which is especially important in complex reconstruction cases, and eliminates the variability of surgical expertise for flap in-setting.},

METHODS: Patients treated by a single urology department from January to June 2013 were identified. A Web-based survey was conducted evaluating patient demographics, preuse perceptions, and acceptance of VV.
RESULTS: In total, 1378 patients (25\%) completed the survey; of which 868 (63\%) were willing to participate in VV for their urologic care. Compared with patients "unlikely," those "likely" to participate in VV were younger (62 vs 65 years), had a college education (77\% vs 65\%), had previous exposure to videoconference technology (57\% vs 38\%), were more comfortable discussing new symptoms (56\% vs 30\%) and sensitive information (48\% vs 27\%), and played an active role in their healthcare (65\% vs 54\%). Moreover, patients willing to participate in VV traveled larger distances ({\textgreater}90 minutes; 69\% vs 58\%), missed more work ({\textgreater}1 day; 39\% vs 29\%), and incurred greater expenses for their care ({\textgreater}\$250; 52\% vs 25\%) relative to those who were unlikely. After controlling for associated patient characteristics, a high level of agreement among urology-specific questions remained independently associated with greater likelihood of VV acceptance among both male and female patients.
CONCLUSION: A large proportion of patients are willing to participate in VV for their urologic care. This may have significant implications by reducing costs and increasing access to, and quality of, health care services. These findings may assist urologists in strategically directing future efforts to reach diverse patient populations via VV technology.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate patient encounters in the outpatient setting using video visit (VV) technology compared to traditional office visits (OVs).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From June 2013 to March 2014, 55 prescreened men with a history of prostate cancer were prospectively randomized. VVs, with the patient at home or at work, were included in the outpatient clinic calendar of urologists.
INTERVENTION: Remote VV versus traditional OV.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: An equivalence analysis was used to assess the primary outcome, visit efficiency as measured by time studies. Secondary outcomes were patient/provider satisfaction and costs.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: There were 28 VVs and 27 OVs. VVs were equivalent in efficiency to relative to OVs, as measured by patient-provider face time (mean 14.5 vs 14.3min; p=0.96), patient wait time (18.4 vs 13.0min; p=0.20), and total time devoted to care (17.9 vs 17.8min; p=0.97). There were no significant differences in patient perception of visit confidentiality, efficiency, education quality, or overall satisfaction. VVs incurred lower costs, including distance traveled (median 0 vs 95 miles), travel time (0 vs 95min), missed work (0 vs 1 d), and money spent on travel (\$0 vs \$48; all p{\textless}0.0001). There was a high level of urologist satisfaction for both VVs (88\%) and OVs (90\%). The major limitation was sample size.
CONCLUSIONS: VV in the ambulatory postprostatectomy setting may have a future role in health care delivery models. We found equivalent efficiency, similar satisfaction, but significantly reduced patient costs for VV compared to OV. Further prospective analyses are warranted.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Among men with surgically treated prostate cancer, we evaluated the utility of remote video visits compared to office visits for outpatient consultation with a urologist. Video visits were associated with equivalent efficiency, similar satisfaction, and significantly lower patient costs when compared to office visits. We conclude that video visits may have a future role in health care delivery models.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases can be acquired in places where invasive procedures are often performed without the proper care of hand washing and material sterilization. There are approximately 500,000 beauty and esthetics centers in Brazil, which are visited by thousands of people every day. Many diseases, including sexually transmitted infections, are still highly prevalent in Brazil, such as warts caused by human papillomavirus, hepatitis B and C, and human immunodeficiency virus infection, and can be transmitted in beauty salons.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have developed a tele-education course divided into four main themes: sexually transmitted infections, indoor health in beauty salon workplaces, hand washing, and material sterilization. The course was made available through a Web site, which included a face-to-face meeting, Web synchronous meetings (chats and Web conferences), and asynchronous resources (reading material, discussion lists, situations simulator, educational videos, and three-dimensional virtual human video animation on sexually transmitted infections and hand washing), mediated by professors and coordinators.
RESULTS: Fifty-two beauty professionals and 33 other professionals were enrolled from different regions. Of the 61 who completed the course and received a certificate at the course's end, 100\% considered good to excellent the course's applicability to everyday life and would recommend it to a fellow professional.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the feasibility of an interactive, tele-education model using low-cost tools as an educational resource to teach beauty professionals. In the future, this may become a branch of nationwide telehealth action.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A teledermatology pilot scheme was first conducted in the town of Manresa (Barcelona) in the summer of 2010. The clinical success of the scheme prompted its expansion to the whole county of Bages in 2011 and to the adjacent county of Berguedà in 2012. In the teledermatology service, primary care physicians take a photograph of the lesion and attach it to the electronic medical records of the patient together with a brief clinical account. In the referral hospital, the consultant dermatologists access the electronic medical records, review the images and suggest a treatment or action plan. Next, the primary care physicians review these recommendations and call the patient to report the results. This whole process is usually completed in less than 5 working days.
METHODS: A cost saving analysis comparing teledermatology with dermatology face-to-face visits was performed in the county of Bages measuring the cost difference attributable to visits saved.
RESULTS: The estimated added costs of the teledermatology service during 2016 amounted to 61,870 €. For the same period, the estimated costs of traditional outpatient dermatology services were of 113,034 €. This represents savings of 51,164 € per year. After subtraction of societal costs, the savings equal 10,350 € per year.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a teledermatology service instead of face-to-face dermatology consultations could save 51,164 € per year (11.4 € per patient visited) in the county of Bages. Societal savings are the most significant.},

METHODS: We used latest-generation cell phones with a HSDPA network broad-band internet access system for video calling and for sending via e-mail high-definition images, chosen by the specialist-at-a-distance during the video call, in times comparable to those achievable with fixed-wired access systems. We tested the diagnostic reliability, the compliance and the efficacy of the method.
RESULTS: We found a significant concordance both between direct and via video call description of the objective signs and between direct and on high definition image description. The Spearman Rank showed a higher correlation between direct observation and high definition image observation than between direct and via video call observation: this last finding matched the experimenters' subjective experience. The compliance was positive and the efficacy comparable with the ambulatorial follow-up.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the "Phone and Mail" method can be seen as being capable of joining together the necessary diagnostic precision and effectiveness with a high degree of practicality and simplicity, thanks to the ease of use of the cell phone, within the reach of everybody, to the ubiquity of its utilization, to the allowed rapidity of diagnosis, practically in real time, and to the low cost of the system.},

OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the REMOTE-CIED study is to evaluate the influence of remote patient monitoring versus in-clinic follow-up on patient-reported outcomes. Secondary objectives are to: 1) identify subgroups of patients who may not be satisfied with remote monitoring; and 2) investigate the cost-effectiveness of remote monitoring.
METHODS: The REMOTE-CIED study is an international randomised controlled study that will include 900 consecutive heart failure patients implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) compatible with the Boston Scientific LATITUDE® Remote Patient Management system at participating centres in five European countries. Patients will be randomised to remote monitoring or in-clinic follow-up. The In-Clinic group will visit the outpatient clinic every 3-6 months, according to standard practice. The Remote Monitoring group only visits the outpatient clinic at 12 and 24 months post-implantation, other check-ups are performed remotely. Patients are asked to complete questionnaires at five time points during the 2-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The REMOTE-CIED study will provide insight into the patient perspective on remote monitoring in ICD patients, which could help to support patient-centred care in the future.},

This study examined the costs of providing a telegeriatric service by videoconference in a rural hospital, compared to the costs of a visiting geriatrician that travels to undertake in-person consultations.
METHODS: A cost analysis was undertaken to compare the costs of the telegeriatric service model with the costs of a visiting geriatrician service model. A recently established telegeriatric service at Warwick Hospital was used as a case study.
RESULTS: In the base case model (assuming four patients per round and a round-trip travel distance of 312 kilometres), an estimated AUD\$131 per patient consultation can be saved in favour of the telegeriatric service model. Key drivers of costs are the number of patients per round and the travel distance and time in the visiting geriatrician model. At a workload of four patients per round, it is less expensive to conduct a telegeriatric service than a visiting geriatrician service when the round-trip travel time exceeds 76 minutes.
DISCUSSION: Even under quite conservative assumptions, a telegeriatric service offers an economically feasible approach to the delivery of specialist geriatric assessment in rural and remote settings.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the diagnostic outcomes and clinical referral pathways of patients assessed and managed through a collaborative care patient-centred teleglaucoma program.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: Eligible patients were those assessed by the referring optometrist or ophthalmologist to be open-angle glaucoma suspects or to have definite early open-angle glaucoma. A glaucoma specialist graded each case through virtual consultation. Clinical referral pathways were noted: in-person consultation with glaucoma specialist, repeat teleconsultation, collaborative glaucoma management with optometrist, or referral for nonglaucomatous ophthalmic pathology.
RESULTS: A total of 247 patients were referred to the program from 2008 to 2012. Of all teleconsults, 31.1\% were diagnosed with glaucoma, 42.1\% were suspects, and 26.7\% were unaffected. Of all patients, 27\% were referred for in-person glaucoma evaluation; 69\% of patients could be managed by their referring optometrist, with 48\% of patients requiring repeat teleconsultation. Treatment was initiated before being seen for 87\% of patients with definite glaucoma and 28\% of glaucoma suspects.
CONCLUSIONS: Of all patients seen through the remote teleglaucoma program, most did not require an in-person consultation with an ophthalmologist and could be managed through distance collaboration. For the approximately one third who were diagnosed with glaucoma based on virtual assessment, medication was started in the majority of cases and in-person consultation was arranged. Further studies to validate and consider cost-effectiveness of this system are under way.},

METHODS: data on 776 consecutive admissions to Grady Memorial Hospital Burn Center between November 2005 and July 2007 were prospectively reviewed. National and international cohorts were compared.
RESULTS: patients' mean age was 31 years, 69.8\% were male, and 87\% were insured. Thirty-nine percent were transfers. Seventy-six percent of transfers (51\% of air transfers) and 70\% of all admissions were for ≤ 10\% total body surface area burns. Helicopter transport cost \$12,500 and averaged 48 miles. Eighty percent of burns were hot water (scald), grease, or flame burns, and 31\% required skin grafting.
CONCLUSIONS: most burns require assessment, debridement, and dressing changes. Grafting is rarely necessary. Patients are transferred because of a lack of training, and patients suffer economic burden and treatment delay. Savings could be realized were patients treated locally with select burn center referral. Video consultation and mentoring can help with triage and care of minor burns. Major burns require burn center referral. International practice reinforces these results.},

E-consults are a promising approach to enhance provider communication, facilitate timely specialty advice and may replace some outpatient visits. Study As part of our health system's efforts to provide more cost-effective care under risk-based contracts, we implemented an e-consult program where referring providers submit patient-specific clinical questions electronically via an electronic referral system. A GI consultant then reviews the patient's record and provides a written recommendation back to the referring physician. For our program evaluation, we conducted chart reviews of each e-consult to understand how the program was being used and surveyed the participating providers and consultants. Results From September 2015 to March 2016, we received 144 e-consults, with most questions concerning GI symptoms or abnormal hepatology labs. Only 36\% of e-consults recommended an in-person GI consult or procedure. In our survey of participating providers, referring providers strongly agreed that the GI e-consults promoted good patient care (88\%) and were satisfied with the program (84\%). The majority of GI consultants felt strongly that e-consults were useful for referring providers and their patients, but that current reimbursement and time allotted were not adequate. Conclusions We report on the implementation of a GI e-consult program within an ACO, showing that many clinical questions could be answered using this mechanism. E-consults in gastroenterology have the potential to reduce unnecessary visits and/or procedures for patients who can be managed by their primary provider, potentially increasing access for other patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrent mood episodes and subsyndromal mood instability cause substantial disability in patients with bipolar disorder. Early identification of mood episodes enabling timely mood stabilization is an important clinical goal. This study investigates the ability of control chart methodology to predict manic and/or depressive episodes by applying Shewhart's control rules to weekly self-reported scores from mania and depression questionnaires.
METHODS: Shewhart's control rules were applied to weekly self-reported scores from the Altman Self-Rating Mania Scale (ASRM) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS) collected from 2001 to 2012 as part of the OXTEXT programme. Manic and depressive episodes were defined as an ASRM score ≥ 10 or a QIDS score ≥ 15, respectively. An episode-free run-in period of eight consecutive weeks without an episode of either type was used to calibrate control charts. Shewhart's rules were then applied to follow-up data. Their sensitivity and positive predictive value for predicting manic or depressive episodes within the next 4 weeks were calculated focusing on the first episode. Secondary analyses varying control chart type, length of episode-free run-in period, time frames to evaluate diagnostic accuracy, thresholds defining either manic or depressive episodes, and missing data methods were performed.
RESULTS: Data from 146 participants (37\% men) were included. The mean age was 43.4 (SD = 13.3) years. The median follow-up was 10 (IQR 5-40) weeks for mania and 10 (IQR 5-23) weeks for depression. A total of 53 (36\%) participants had a manic episode and 67 (46\%) had a depressive episode. For manic episodes, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of Shewhart's control rules were 30\% (95\% CI 19-45\%) and 7\% (95\% CI 5-9\%), and for depressive episodes, 33\% (95\% CI 22-46\%) and 9\% (95\% CI 6-12\%), respectively. Results from secondary analyses were similar to these.
CONCLUSIONS: Tele-monitoring with control rules has the potential to predict about one-third of manic or depressive episodes before they occur, at the cost of a high false positive rate. Given the severe consequences of manic and depressive episodes, this trade-off may be desirable.},

This paper takes a multistakeholder approach to explore how digital technology can support the cocreation of value between patients and their care teams in the delivery of total knee replacement (TKR) surgery, an increasingly common procedure to return mobility and relieve pain for people suffering from osteoarthritis.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate communications and interactions between patients and care teams in the delivery of TKR to identify opportunities for digital technology to add value to TKR health care service by enhancing the cocreation of value.
METHODS: A multistakeholder qualitative study of user needs was conducted with Australian stakeholders (N=34): surgeons (n=12), physiotherapists (n=3), patients (n=11), and general practitioners (n=8). Data from focus groups and interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Encounters between patients and their care teams are information-rich but time-poor. Results showed seven different stages of the TKR journey that starts with referral to a surgeon and ends with a postoperative review at 12 months. Each stage of the journey has different information and communication challenges that can be enhanced by digital technology. Opportunities for digital technology include improved waiting list management, supporting and reinforcing patient retention and recall of information, motivating and supporting rehabilitation, improving patient preparation for hospital stay, and reducing risks and anxiety associated with postoperative wound care.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital technology can add value to patients' care team communications by enhancing information flow, assisting patient recall and retention of information, improving accessibility and portability of information, tailoring information to individual needs, and by providing patients with tools to engage in their own health care management. For care teams, digital technology can add value through early detection of postoperative complications, proactive surveillance of health data for postoperative patients and patients on waiting lists, higher compliance with rehabilitation programs, and reduced length of stay. Digital technology has the potential to improve patient satisfaction and outcomes, as well as potentially reduce hospital length of stay and the burden of disease associated with postoperative morbidity.},

To help guide the development of nursing education to facilitate adoption and use, the current study examined predictors of Dutch nurses' willingness to use HT, based on a survey of 67 Dutch nurses with and 126 without HT experience. Nurses' willingness to use this technology was predicted by HT's (a) perceived usefulness to the client, (b) effort expectancy, (c) social influence, and (d) cost expectations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Audio-visual teleconsultation is expected to help home-based palliative patients, hospital-based palliative care professionals, and family physicians to jointly design better, pro-active care. Consensual knowledge of the possibilities and limitations of teleconsultation in transmural palliative care is, however, largely lacking.This paper aims at describing elements of both the physical workplace and the cultural-social context of the palliative care practice, which are imperative for the use of teleconsultation technologies.
METHODS: A semi-structured expert meeting and qualitative, open interviews were deployed to explore professionals' assumptions and wishes, which are considered to contain latent presumptions about the practice's physical workplace and latent elements of the cultural-social context, regarding (1) the mediating potential of audio-visual teleconsultation, (2) how the audio-visual teleconsultations will affect medical practice, and (3) the design and usage of the teleconsultation technology. We used a qualitative analysis to investigate how palliative care professionals interpret the teleconsultation package in preparation. The analysis entailed open and axial coding techniques developed in a grounded theory approach.
RESULTS: Respondents assume: 1. teleconsultation will hinder physical proximity, thereby compromising anamnesis and diagnosis of new or acutely ill patients as well as "real contact" with the person behind the patient; 2. teleconsultation will help patients becoming more of a pivotal figure in their own care trajectory; 3. they can use teleconsultation to keep a finger on the pulse; 4. teleconsultations have a healing effect of their own due to offered time and digital attention; 5. teleconsultation to open up an additional "gray" network outside the hierarchical structures of the established chain of transmural palliative care. This network could cause bypassing of caregivers and uncertainty about responsibilities; 6. teleconsultations lead to an extended flow of information which helps palliative care professionals to check the stories of patients and medical specialists.
CONCLUSIONS: Professionals assume teleconsultation co-defines a new patient-professional relationship by extending hospital-based caregivers' perceptions of as well as attention for their patients. At the cost, however, of clinical and personal connectedness. Secondly, a hermeneutics is needed to carefully interpret teleconsultation images. Thirdly, teleconsultations transform caregiving cultures as formerly separated care domains collide, demanding a redefinition of roles and responsibilities.},

	abstract = {Background: Consultation of a nephrologist is important in aligning care for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at the primary-secondary care interface. However, current consultation methods come with practical difficulties that can lead to postponed consultation or patient referral instead.
Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether a web-based consultation platform, telenephrology, led to a lower referral rate of indicated patients. Furthermore, we assessed consultation rate, quality of care, costs and general practitioner (GPs') experiences with telenephrology.
Methods: Cluster randomized controlled trial with 47 general practices in the Netherlands was randomized to access to telenephrology or to enhanced usual care. A total of 3004 CKD patients aged 18 years or older who were under primary care were included (intervention group n = 1277, control group n = 1727) and 2693 completed the trial. All practices participated in a CKD management course and were given an overview of their CKD patients.
Results: The referral rates amounted to 2.3\% (n = 29) in the intervention group and 3.0\% (n = 52) in the control group, which was a non-significant difference, OR 0.61; 95\% CI 0.31 to 1.23. The intervention group's consultation rate was 6.3\% (n = 81) against 5.0\% (n = 87) (OR 2.00; 95\% CI 0.75-5.33). We found no difference in quality of care or costs. The majority of GPs had a positive opinion about telenephrology.
Conclusion: The data in our study do not allow for conclusions on the effect of telenephrology on the rate of patient referrals and provider-to-provider consultations, compared to conventional methods. It was positively evaluated by GPs and was non-inferior in terms of quality of care and costs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Teledermatology, the application of telemedicine in the field of dermatology, has similar accuracy and reliability as physical dermatology. Teledermatology has been widely used in daily practice in the Netherlands since 2005 and is fully reimbursed.
OBJECTIVES: This study prospectively investigated the effect of teledermatology on efficiency, quality and costs of care when integrated in daily practice and applied following patient selection by the general practitioner (GP).
METHODS: Teledermatology consultations between GP and regional dermatologist were performed in daily GP practice in the Netherlands. Efficiency of care was measured by the decrease in the number of physical referrals to the dermatologist. Quality of care was measured by the percentage of teleconsultations for second opinion, physical referrals resulting from these teleconsultations, the response time of the dermatologists and educational effect experienced by the GP. Costs of conventional healthcare without teledermatology were compared with costs with teledermatology.
RESULTS: One thousand, eight hundred and twenty GPs and 166 dermatologists performed teledermatology, and 37,207 teleconsultations performed from March 2007 to September 2010 were included. In the group of patients where the GP used teleconsultation to prevent a referral (n =26,596), 74\% of physical referrals were prevented. In the group of patients where the GP used teleconsultation for a second opinion (n =10,611), 16\% were physically referred after teleconsultation. The prevented referral rate in the total population was 68\%. The mean response time of dermatologists was 4·6 h (median 2·0). GPs indicated that there was a beneficial educational effect in 85\% of the teleconsultations. The estimated cost reduction was 18\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Teledermatology can lead to efficient care probably at lower cost. We are therefore of the opinion that teledermatology following GP selection should be considered as a possible pathway of referral to secondary care.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In the Canadian province of Alberta access and quality of stroke care were suboptimal, especially in remote areas. The government introduced the Alberta Provincial Stroke Strategy (APSS) in 2005, an integrated strategy to improve access to stroke care, quality and efficiency which utilizes telehealth.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the process flow and the structure of the care pathways of the APSS?
METHODOLOGY: Information for this article was obtained using documentation, archival APSS records, interviews with experts, direct observation and participant observation.
RESULTS: The process flow is described. The APSS integrated evidence-based practice, multidisciplinary communication, and telestroke services. It includes regular quality evaluation and improvement.
CONCLUSION: Access, efficiency and quality of care improved since the start of the APSS across many domains, through improvement of expertise and equipment in small hospitals, accessible consultation of stroke specialists using telestroke, enhancing preventive care, enhancing multidisciplinary collaboration, introducing uniform best practice protocols and bypass-protocols for the emergency medical services.
DISCUSSION: The APSS overcame substantial obstacles to decrease discrepancies and to deliver integrated higher quality care. Telestroke has proven itself to be safe and feasible. The APSS works efficiently, which is in line to other projects worldwide, and is, based on limited results, cost effective. Further research on cost-effectiveness is necessary.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Almost one-fifth of the population of Saudi Arabia lives in rural areas and may still lack access to specialty healthcare. Because of the growing demand for telehealth services, we initiated the virtual clinic (VC) concept for new referrals to the pediatric urology clinic (PUC), the primary tertiary care unit in Riyadh.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of costs and timing involved with the VC practice for a 1-year period. The cost analysis is based on savings realized by patients as a result of the VC evaluation. A 15-question nonvalidated satisfaction survey was also conducted by an independent observer.
RESULTS: Of 105 patients assessed through the VC program, 44 were accepted for surgery and further investigation. The number of trips to the center saved by the virtual encounter were 203, resulting in a savings of 740,950 Saudi Arabian Riyals (SAR) minus the cost of the VC. The cost of conducting most of the investigations at the referring hospital instead of the PUC represented a savings of 639,970 SAR. Thus, the overall cost savings to patient and family and to the PUC was 1,311,570 SAR. An additional benefit was the reduction in the time for treatment from 6.6 to 3.9 months. The overall satisfaction rate was 89\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary, our study indicates that telemedicine can achieve a cost savings without compromising the safety or adversely affecting patient management. Further studies should more clearly define the benefits and any limitations, and reveal how the technology could be used most effectively.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of new-onset blindness in adults. Telemedicine is a validated, cost-effective method to improve monitoring. However, little is known of patients' attitudes toward telemedicine for DR. Our study explores factors that influence patients' attitudes toward participating in telemedicine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety seven participants in a university and the Veterans Administration setting completed a survey. Only people with diabetes mellitus (DM) were included. The main outcome was willingness to participate in telemedicine. The other outcomes were perceived convenience and impact on the patient-physician relationship. Participants reported demographic information, comorbidities, and access to healthcare. Analysis was performed with t-tests and multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Demographic factors were not associated with the outcomes (all p {\textgreater} 0.05). Patients had decreased odds of willingness if they valued the patient-physician relationship (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.08, confidence interval [CI] = 0.02-0.35, p = 0.001) or had a longer duration of diabetes (adjusted OR = 0.93, CI = 0.88-0.99, p = 0.02). Patients had increased odds of willingness if they perceived increased convenience (adjusted OR = 8.10, CI = 1.77-36.97, p = 0.01) or had more systemic comorbidities (adjusted OR = 1.85, CI = 1.10-3.11, p = 0.02).
DISCUSSION: It is critical to understand the attitudes of people with DM where telemedicine shows promise for disease management and end-organ damage prevention. Patients' attitudes are influenced by their health and perceptions, but not by their demographics. Receptive patients focus on convenience, whereas unreceptive patients strongly value their patient-physician relationships or have long-standing DM. Telemedicine monitoring should be designed for people who are in need and receptive to telemedicine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stroke is a very time-sensitive pathology, and many new solutions target the optimization of prehospital stroke care to improve the stroke management process. In-ambulance telemedicine, defined by live bidirectional audio-video between a patient and a neurologist in a moving ambulance and the automated transfer of vital parameters, is a promising new approach to speed up and improve the quality of acute stroke care. Currently, no evidence exists on the cost effectiveness of in-ambulance telemedicine.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop a first cost effectiveness model for in-ambulance telemedicine and use this model to estimate the time savings needed before in-ambulance telemedicine becomes cost effective.
METHODS: Current standard stroke care is compared with current standard stroke care supplemented with in-ambulance telemedicine using a cost-utility model measuring costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from a health care perspective. We combine a decision tree with a Markov model. Data from the UZ Brussel Stroke Registry (2282 stroke patients) and linked hospital claims data at individual level are combined with literature data to populate the model. A 2-way sensitivity analysis varying both implementation costs and time gain is performed to map the different cost-effective combinations and identify the time gain needed for cost effectiveness and dominance. For several modeled time gains, the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve is calculated and mapped in 1 figure.
RESULTS: Under the base-case scenario (implementation cost of US \$159,425) and taking a lifetime horizon into account, in-ambulance telemedicine is a cost-effective strategy compared to standard stroke care alone starting from a time gain of 6 minutes. After 12 minutes, in-ambulance telemedicine becomes dominant, and this results in a mean decrease of costs by US -\$30 (95\% CI -\$32 to -\$29) per patient with 0.00456 (95\% CI 0.00448 to 0.00463) QALYs on average gained per patient. In over 82\% of all probabilistic simulations, in-ambulance telemedicine remains under the cost-effectiveness threshold of US \$47,747.
CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that in-ambulance telemedicine can be cost effective starting from a time gain of 6 minutes and becomes a dominant strategy after approximately 15 minutes. This indicates that in-ambulance telemedicine has the potential to become a cost-effective intervention assuming time gains in clinical implementations are realized in the future.},

Flight diversions due to medical emergencies carry a significant financial and legal cost. The purpose of this study was to determine the causes of in-flight medical diversions from Air Canada.
METHODS: This was a review of in-flight medical emergencies from 2004-2008. Both telemedicine and Air Canada databases were crossreferenced to capture all incidents. Presenting complaints were categorized by systems. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: Over the 5 yr, there were 220 diversions, of which 91 (41.4\%) of the decisions were made by pilots or onboard medical personnel. During this period there were 5386 telemedicine contacts with ground support providers, who on average recommended 2.4 diversions per 100 calls. The rate for diversions almost doubled from 2006 to 2007, with a sharp drop in telemedicine contacts during the same period. The four most common categories resulting in diversions were cardiac (58 diversions, 26.4\%), neurological (43 diversions, 19.5\%), gastrointestinal (GI) (25 diversions, 11.4\%), and syncope (22 diversions, 10.0\%). Only 6.8\% of all diversions were due to cardiac arrest.
DISCUSSION: Medical conditions most commonly leading to diversions were cardiac, neurological, gastrointestinal, and syncope. Our study showed that a decrease in telemedicine contact during this period was accompanied by an increase in diversions, while increased pre-screening of passengers did not prove effective in decreasing diversion rates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intracerebral hemorrhage is a devastating disease with no specific treatment modalities. A significant proportion of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage are transferred to large stroke treatment centers, such as Comprehensive Stroke Centers, because of perceived need for higher level of care. However, evidence of improvement in patient-centered outcomes for these patients treated at larger stroke treatment centers as compared to community hospitals is lacking. METHODS / DESIGN: "Efficient Resource Utilization for Patients with Intracerebral Hemorrhage (EnRICH)" is a prospective, multisite, state-wide, cohort study designed to assess the impact of level of care on long-term patient-centered outcomes for patients with primary / non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage. The study is funded by the Texas state legislature via the Lone Star Stroke Research Consortium. It is being implemented via major hub hospitals in large metropolitan cities across the state of Texas. Each hub has an extensive network of "spoke" hospitals, which are connected to the hub via traditional clinical and administrative arrangements, or by telemedicine technologies. This infrastructure provides a unique opportunity to track outcomes for intracerebral hemorrhage patients managed across a health system at various levels of care. Eligible patients are enrolled during hospitalization and are followed for functional, quality of life, cognitive, resource utilization, and dependency outcomes at 30 and 90 days post discharge. As a secondary aim, an economic analysis of the incremental cost-effectiveness of treating intracerebral hemorrhage patients at higher levels of care will be conducted.
DISCUSSION: Findings from EnRICH will provide much needed evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of regionalized care for intracerebral hemorrhage patients. Such evidence is required to inform policy and streamline clinical decision-making.},

To help fill this gap in knowledge, we describe early experiences with Teladoc, one of the largest telemedicine providers in the United States, which provides care directly to patients over the telephone or via the Internet. We analyzed claims data for a large California agency serving public employees that recently offered Teladoc as a covered service. The 3,701 Teladoc "visits" we studied were for a broad range of diagnostic categories, the most common of which were acute respiratory conditions, urinary tract infections, and skin problems. Compared to patients who visited a physician's office for a similar condition, adult Teladoc users were younger and less likely to have used health care before the introduction of Teladoc. Patients who used Teladoc were less likely to have a follow-up visit to any setting, compared to those patients who visited a physician's office or emergency department. Teladoc appears to be expanding access to patients who are not connected to other providers. Future research should assess the impact of Teladoc and other telehealth interventions on the quality and cost of care.},

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective noncontrolled study at a tertiary medical center of a cohort of 39 patients undergoing postoperative care after parathyroidectomy through TeleHealth at a number of sites at various distances from the primary surgical facility.
METHODS: From October 2006 through January 2010, 149 patients underwent parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism at one tertiary medical center by a single surgeon. Age, sex, distance from the patient's home to the surgical center and to the TeleHealth site, effective completion of the TeleHealth visit, and postoperative complications were recorded.
RESULTS: Of the 149 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy, 39 had their postoperative visit using TeleHealth (26\%). There were 26 females (67\%) and 13 (33\%) males. Mean age was 64 years. All visits were effectively carried out and completed with a nurse and the patient at a remote TeleHealth site and the surgeon at the surgical center site. There were no postoperative surgical complications noted with the visits. Average round-distance travel saved was 119 miles. The travel distance saved translated into an average savings of \$357.00 per patient (which included estimations of transportation costs and lost work time), with further immeasurable benefits to the patient and healthcare system.
CONCLUSIONS: TeleHealth is a cost-effective and efficient way to follow-up with patients who have undergone parathyroidectomy, with significant convenience and financial benefits for the patient and healthcare system.},

We report on a feasibility study of remote access to eMRs for SDV and the potential advantages of such a process in terms of resource allocation and cost.
METHODS: The Clinical Trials Unit at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, in collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Australia, conducted a 6-month feasibility study of remote SDV. A Novartis monitor was granted dedicated software and restricted remote access to the eMR portal of the cancer center, thereby providing an avenue through which perform SDV.
RESULTS: Six monitoring visits were conducted during the study period, four of which were performed remotely. The ability to conduct two thirds of the monitoring visits remotely in this complex phase III study resulted in an overall cost saving to Novartis. Similarly, remote monitoring eased the strain on internal resources, particularly monitoring space and hospital computer terminal access, at the cancer center.
CONCLUSION: Remote access to patient eMRs for SDV is feasible and is potentially an avenue through which resources can be more efficiently used. Although this feasibility study involved limited numbers, there is no limit to scaling these processes to any number of patients enrolled onto large clinical trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: From 1992 to 2008, older adults in the United States incurred more healthcare expense per capita than any other age group. Home telemonitoring has emerged as a potential solution to reduce these costs, but evidence is mixed. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate whether the mean difference in total direct medical cost consequence between older adults receiving additional home telemonitoring care (TELE) (n=102) and those receiving usual medical care (UC) (n=103) were significant. Inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, decedents, survivors, and 30-day readmission costs were evaluated as secondary aim.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multivariate generalized linear models (GLMs) and parametric bootstrapping method were used to model cost and to determine significance of the cost differences. We also compared the differences in arithmetic mean costs.
RESULTS: From the conditional GLMs, the estimated mean cost differences (TELE versus UC) for total, inpatient, outpatient, and ED were -\$9,537 (p=0.068), -\$8,482 (p =0.098), -\$1,160 (p=0.177), and \$106 (p=0.619), respectively. Mean postenrollment cost was 11\% lower than the prior year for TELE versus 22\% higher for UC. The ratio of mean cost for decedents to survivors was 2.1:1 (TELE) versus 12.7:1 (UC).
CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the mean total cost between the two treatment groups. The TELE group had less variability in cost of care, lower decedents to survivors cost ratio, and lower total 30-day readmission cost than the UC group.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between distance traveled for an abortion and site of postabortion care among low-income women.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using claims data from 39,747 abortions covered by California's Medicaid program in 2011-2012. Primary outcomes were the odds of abortion-related visits to an emergency department (ED) and the original abortion site, and the secondary outcome was total abortion care costs. We used mixed-effects logistic regression adjusting for patient and abortion characteristics to examine the associations between distance traveled and subsequent abortion-related care at each location.
RESULTS: Among all abortions (N=39,747), 3\% (95\% CI 2.9-3.3, n=1,232) were followed by an ED visit (3\% first-trimester aspirations, 2\% second trimester or later, and 4\% medication abortions) and 25\% (95\% CI 24.1-24.9, n=9,745) were followed by a visit to the original abortion site (4\% first-trimester aspirations, 3\% second-trimester or later, and 77\% medication abortions). Women traveling farther for their abortions had higher odds of visiting an ED (100 or more miles compared with less than 25 miles, first-trimester aspirations: adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.29, 95\% CI 1.50-3.49; medication abortions: adjusted OR 2.30, 95\% CI 1.34-3.93) and lower odds of returning to their abortion site for follow-up (100 or more miles compared with less than 25 miles, first-trimester aspirations: adjusted OR 0.36, 95\% CI 0.18-0.70; second trimester or later: adjusted OR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.31-0.88; and medication abortions: adjusted OR 0.33, 95\% CI 0.23-0.50). Costs were consistently higher when subsequent care occurred at an ED rather than the abortion site (median cost \$941 compared with \$536, P{\textless}.001).
CONCLUSION: For most patients, greater distance traveled for abortion was associated with increased likelihood of seeking subsequent care at an ED. Increasing the number of rural Medicaid abortion providers and reimbursing providers for telemedicine and alternatives to routine follow-up would likely improve continuity of care and reduce state costs by shifting the location of follow-up from EDs back to abortion providers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcosine is an amino acid that is formed by methylation of glycine and is present in trace amounts in the body. Increased sarcosine concentrations in blood plasma and urine are manifested in sarcosinemia and in some other diseases such as prostate cancer. For this purpose, sarcosine detection using the nanomedicine approach was proposed. In this study, we have prepared superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with different modified surface area. Nanoparticles (NPs) were modified by chitosan (CS), and sarcosine oxidase (SOX). SPIONs without any modification were taken as controls. Methods and Results: The obtained NPs were characterized by physicochemical methods. The size of the NPs determined by the dynamic light scattering method was as follows: SPIONs/Au/NPs (100⁻300 nm), SPIONs/Au/CS/NPs (300⁻700 nm), and SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs (600⁻1500 nm). The amount of CS deposited on the NP surface was found to be 48 mg/mL for SPIONs/Au/CS/NPs and 39 mg/mL for SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs, and repeatability varied around 10\%. Pseudo-peroxidase activity of NPs was verified using sarcosine, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a substrate. For TMB, all NPs tested evinced substantial pseudo-peroxidase activity at 650 nm. The concentration of SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs in the reaction mixture was optimized to 0⁻40 mg/mL. Trinder reaction for sarcosine detection was set up at 510 nm at an optimal reaction temperature of 37 °C and pH 8.0. The course of the reaction was linear for 150 min. The smallest amount of NPs that was able to detect sarcosine was 0.2 mg/well (200 µL of total volume) with the linear dependence y = 0.0011x - 0.0001 and the correlation coefficient r = 0.9992, relative standard deviation (RSD) 6.35\%, limit of detection (LOD) 5 µM. The suggested method was further validated for artificial urine analysis (r = 0.99, RSD 21.35\%, LOD 18 µM). The calculation between the detected and applied concentrations showed a high correlation coefficient (r = 0.99). NPs were tested for toxicity and no significant growth inhibition was observed in any model system (S. cerevisiae, S. aureus, E. coli). The hemolytic activity of the prepared NPs was similar to that of the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) control. The reaction system was further tested on real urine specimens. Conclusion: The proposed detection system allows the analysis of sarcosine at micromolar concentrations and to monitor changes in its levels as a potential prostate cancer marker. The whole system is suitable for low-cost miniaturization and point-of-care testing technology and diagnostic systems. This system is simple, inexpensive, and convenient for screening tests and telemedicine applications.},

It is unknown how the physical separation related to telehealth use may affect the experience of presence among nurses during nurse-patient interactions.
PURPOSE: The purpose of the research was to gain knowledge about the ways that nurses experience presence during interactions with patients using telehealth technology.
METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design with convenience sampling was used for this study. Sample inclusion criteria included being a registered nurse with at least 1 year of experience using telehealth technology and working in telehealth at the time of the study. Institutional review board approval was received before beginning data collection. Participants (n = 6) provided informed consent. Qualitative data were obtained by individual, audiotaped, semistructured interviews. The data were transcribed and analyzed deductively for the existence of presence.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Many veterans live in rural areas distant from Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and receive primary medical care from community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). These veterans often must travel great distances to the nearest VAMC for neuropsychological evaluations, resulting in poor access to care, travel reimbursement costs, fee-basis evaluations of uncontrolled quality, and driving safety concerns. Return trips for feedback compound complications. Accordingly, we initiated a pilot trial of neuropsychological evaluation and feedback via telemedicine (i.e., clinical videoconferencing).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Participants were veterans referred for neuropsychological evaluation from a rural CBOC 115 miles from the regional VAMC. All veterans were given the choice to undergo evaluation at the CBOC via telemedicine or in-person at the VAMC. Telemedicine equipment allowed presentation of digitized material with simultaneous patient observation. Testing materials were organized in numbered folders and given to veterans by CBOC clerks immediately prior to evaluation. Clerks returned completed materials via facsimile.
RESULTS: Fifteen veterans from the rural CBOC were seen for neuropsychological evaluation. Eight chose telemedicine evaluation. Groups based on evaluation modality appeared similar on demographics, referral basis, resulting neuropsychiatric diagnoses, and follow-through on recommendations. No significant technical or clinical difficulties were encountered, and veterans reported satisfaction with telemedicine. All veterans requested feedback via telemedicine.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychological evaluation via telemedicine is feasible and appears comparable to in-person evaluation. Experiences are encouraging and consistent with the broader literature on the acceptance of and satisfaction with clinical videoconferencing. Future studies will assess possible psychometric issues in clinical populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, healthcare utilization (HCU) and expenditures related to shocks have not been quantified.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators identified from commercial and Medicare supplemental claims databases linked to adjudicated shock events from remote monitoring data. A shock event was defined as ≥1 spontaneous shocks delivered by an implanted device. Shock-related HCU was ascertained from inpatient and outpatient claims within 7 days following a shock event. Shock events were adjudicated and classified as inappropriate or appropriate, and HCU and expenditures, stratified by shock type, were quantified. Of 10 266 linked patients, 963 (9.4\%) patients (61.3±13.6 years; 81\% male) had 1885 shock events (56\% appropriate, 38\% inappropriate, and 6\% indeterminate). Of these events, 867 (46\%) had shock-related HCU (14\% inpatient and 32\% outpatient). After shocks, inpatient cardiovascular procedures were common, including echocardiography (59\%), electrophysiology study or ablation (34\%), stress testing (16\%), and lead revision (11\%). Cardiac catheterization was common (71\% and 51\%), but percutaneous coronary intervention was low (6.5\% and 5.0\%) after appropriate and inappropriate shocks. Expenditures related to appropriate and inappropriate shocks were not significantly different.
CONCLUSIONS: After implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock, related HCU was common, with 1 in 3 shock events followed by outpatient HCU and 1 in 7 followed by hospitalization. Use of invasive cardiovascular procedures was substantial, even after inappropriate shocks, which comprised 38\% of all shocks. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks seem to trigger a cascade of health care. Strategies to reduce shocks could result in cost savings.},

	abstract = {Medication non-adherence is a major concern in the healthcare industry and has led to increases in health risks and medical costs. For many neurological diseases, adherence to medication regimens can be assessed by observing movement patterns. However, physician observations are typically assessed based on visual inspection of movement and are limited to clinical testing procedures. Consequently, medication adherence is difficult to measure when patients are away from the clinical setting. The authors propose a data mining driven methodology that uses low cost, non-wearable multimodal sensors to model and predict patients' adherence to medication protocols, based on variations in their gait. The authors conduct a study involving Parkinson's disease patients that are "on" and "off" their medication in order to determine the statistical validity of the methodology. The data acquired can then be used to quantify patients' adherence while away from the clinic. Accordingly, this data-driven system may allow for early warnings regarding patient safety. Using whole-body movement data readings from the patients, the authors were able to discriminate between PD patients on and off medication, with accuracies greater than 97\% for some patients using an individually customized model and accuracies of 78\% for a generalized model containing multiple patient gait data. The proposed methodology and study demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of using low cost, non-wearable hardware and data mining models to monitor medication adherence outside of the traditional healthcare facility. These innovations may allow for cost effective, remote monitoring of treatment of neurological diseases.},

Key clinical features of PD are motor-related and are typically assessed by healthcare providers based on qualitative visual inspection of a patient's movement/gait/posture. More advanced diagnostic techniques such as computed tomography scans that measure brain function, can be cost prohibitive and may expose patients to radiation and other harmful effects. To mitigate these challenges, and open a pathway to remote patient-physician assessment, the authors of this work propose a data mining driven methodology that uses low cost, non-invasive sensors to model and predict the presence (or lack therefore) of PD movement abnormalities and model clinical subtypes. The study presented here evaluates the discriminative ability of non-invasive hardware and data mining algorithms to classify PD cases and controls. A 10-fold cross validation approach is used to compare several data mining algorithms in order to determine that which provides the most consistent results when varying the subject gait data. Next, the predictive accuracy of the data mining model is quantified by testing it against unseen data captured from a test pool of subjects. The proposed methodology demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive, low cost, hardware and data mining models to monitor the progression of gait features outside of the traditional healthcare facility, which may ultimately lead to earlier diagnosis of emerging neurological diseases.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This paper proposes a novel system (using the Nintendo Wii remote) that offers customised, non-immersive, virtual reality-based, upper-limb stroke rehabilitation and reports on promising preliminary findings with stroke survivors.
METHOD: The system novelty lies in the high accuracy of the full kinematic tracking of the upper limb movement in real-time, offering strong personal connection between the stroke survivor and a virtual character when executing therapist prescribed adjustable exercises/games. It allows the therapist to monitor patient performance and to individually calibrate the system in terms of range of movement, speed and duration.
RESULTS: The system was tested for acceptability with three stroke survivors with differing levels of disability. Participants reported an overwhelming connection with the system and avatar. A two-week, single case study with a long-term stroke survivor showed positive changes in all four outcome measures employed, with the participant reporting better wrist control and greater functional use. Activities, which were deemed too challenging or too easy were associated with lower scores of enjoyment/motivation, highlighting the need for activities to be individually calibrated.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the preliminary findings, it would be beneficial to extend the case study in terms of duration and participants and to conduct an acceptability and feasibility study with community dwelling survivors. Implications for Rehabilitation Low-cost, off-the-shelf game sensors, such as the Nintendo Wii remote, are acceptable by stroke survivors as an add-on to upper limb stroke rehabilitation but have to be bespoked to provide high-fidelity and real-time kinematic tracking of the arm movement. Providing therapists with real-time and remote monitoring of the quality of the movement and not just the amount of practice, is imperative and most critical for getting a better understanding of each patient and administering the right amount and type of exercise. The ability to translate therapeutic arm movement into individually calibrated exercises and games, allows accommodation of the wide range of movement difficulties seen after stroke and the ability to adjust these activities (in terms of speed, range of movement and duration) will aid motivation and adherence - key issues in rehabilitation. With increasing pressures on resources and the move to more community-based rehabilitation, the proposed system has the potential for promoting the intensity of practice necessary for recovery in both community and acute settings.},

At present, UPDRS is determined by the subjective clinical evaluation of the patient's ability to adequately cope with a range of tasks. In this study, we extend recent findings that UPDRS can be objectively assessed to clinically useful accuracy using simple, self-administered speech tests, without requiring the patient's physical presence in the clinic. We apply a wide range of known speech signal processing algorithms to a large database (approx. 6000 recordings from 42 PD patients, recruited to a six-month, multi-centre trial) and propose a number of novel, nonlinear signal processing algorithms which reveal pathological characteristics in PD more accurately than existing approaches. Robust feature selection algorithms select the optimal subset of these algorithms, which is fed into non-parametric regression and classification algorithms, mapping the signal processing algorithm outputs to UPDRS. We demonstrate rapid, accurate replication of the UPDRS assessment with clinically useful accuracy (about 2 UPDRS points difference from the clinicians' estimates, p{\textless}0.001). This study supports the viability of frequent, remote, cost-effective, objective, accurate UPDRS telemonitoring based on self-administered speech tests.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Early studies of plastic surgery patient triage using telemedicine are descriptive and deal with feasibility rather than accuracy. The inpatient study arm compares on-site wound-evaluation accuracy with remotely viewed digital images. The outpatient arm prospectively compares on-site and remote diagnosis, management, and outcomes in a busy, urban, reconstructive-surgery clinic. The concurrent 6 patient case studies illustrate significant systems improvement by using remote consultation.
METHODS: A total of 43 inpatients and 100 consecutive outpatients were evaluated by on-site and remote surgeons as performed in previous arms with digital-camera and store and forward technology. Consent was obtained from all patients participating. Agreements regarding diagnosis (skin lesion, hand injury, wound type, and scar character) and management (healing problem, emergent evaluation, antibiotics, and hospitalization) were calculated.
RESULTS: In the first study arm, on-site and remote agreement (46\%-86\% for wound description and 65\%-81\% for management) generally matched agreement among on-site surgeons (68\%-100\% and 84\%-89\%). Moreover, when on-site agreement was low (68\% for edema), agreement between on-site and remote surgeons was also low (57\%). Remote evaluation was least sensitive detecting wound drainage (46\%). On-site surgeons opted for more treatment, often prescribing antibiotics and admitting the patient. The second teleconsult arm provides further evidence of accuracy, overall agreement of 32\%, sensitivity 48.55\%, specificity 96.92\%, positive predictive value 49.26\%, negative predictive value 96.83\%, and P {\textless} .001 regarding diagnosis (skin lesion, hand injury, wound type, wound problem, and scar character). Patient transfer, postoperative monitoring, and outcomes via electronic image transfer, as well as cost-benefit analysis of this clinic-based study, are presented.
CONCLUSIONS: eConsultation renders similar outcomes to standard, on-site examination in a selected group of plastic surgery patients. Remote evaluation may assist triage decisions, thereby decreasing emergency room throughput time and office-visit frequency, supplementing satellite facility consultation by plastic surgeons, and providing real-time postoperative assessments, thereby improving quality and reducing costs.},

To date, there is very limited published information in the field of telehealth and paediatric nephrology. The aim of this study was to review our experience with paediatric telenephrology in Queensland, Australia.
METHODS: A retrospective audit of paediatric nephrology telehealth consultations to determine the nature of the telehealth activity, reasons for referral to telehealth, and to compare costs and potential savings of the telehealth service.
RESULTS: During a ten-year period (2004 - 2013), 318 paediatric telenephrology consultations occurred for 168 patients (95 male) with the median age of 8 years (range 3 weeks to 24 years). Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (30 \%), followed by nephrotic syndrome (16 \%), kidney transplant (12 \%), and urinary tract infection (9 \%) were the most common diagnoses. The estimated cost savings associated with telehealth were \$31,837 in 2013 (average saving of \$505 per consultation).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that paediatric telenephrology is a viable and economic method for patient assessment and follow up. The benefits include improved access to paediatric nephrology services for patients and their families, educational opportunity for the regional medical teams, and a substantial cost saving for the health care system.},

METHODS: The system was realized using open-source software and COTS technologies. It is based on the transmission of two simultaneous video streams, obtained by direct digitization of the output of an ultrasound machine and by a netcam showing the examination that is taking place. These streams are then embedded into a web page so they are accessible, together with basic video controls, via a standard web browser. The system can also record video streams on a server for further use.
RESULTS: The system was tested on a small group of neonatal cases with suspected cardiopathies for a preliminary assessment of its features and diagnostic capabilities. Both the clinical and technological results were encouraging and are leading the way for further experimentation.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented system can transfer clinical images and videos in an efficient way and in real time. It can be used in the same hospital to support internal consultancy requests, in remote areas using Internet connections and for didactic purposes using low cost COTS appliances and simple interfaces for end users. The solution proposed can be extended to control different medical appliances in those remote hospitals.},

The purpose is to compare transfers for hand injuries prior to and after the implementation of this system.
METHODS: The hospital institutional database was queried for all transfers to a level 1 medical center in the state from 2012 to 2015, allowing the comparison of data prior to and after the institution of the AHTTP. Patient disposition from the emergency department was categorized to evaluate the impact of AHTTP. Distance, mode of transport, and transport cost were assessed.
FINDINGS: There were 202 transfers for the treatment of isolated hand trauma (92 from 2012 to 2013 and 110 from 2014 to 2015). Prior to the institution of AHTTP, transfer patients were admitted 47.8\% of the time compared with 68.2\% of the time after the development of the program ( P = .02). The approximate cost of transport for patients who were discharged home directly from the emergency department was 38.5\% (US \$47,233) of the total costs for the 2012-2013 period and was 21.4\% (US \$34,017) of the costs for the 2014-2015 period ( P {\textless} .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a statistically significant decrease in the number of unnecessary transfers and transportation costs after the telemedicine program was started. The implementation of AHTTP in a rural state reduced health care costs and improved the efficiency of hand specialty care.},

There was overall agreement in the diagnosis of leprosy in 74\% of the 106 remaining cases. The sensitivity was 78\% and the specificity was 31\%. Although the specificity was low, the study suggests that telemedicine may be a useful low-cost method for obtaining second opinions in programmes to control leprosy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medication adherence remains a difficult problem to both assess and improve in patients. It is a multifactorial problem that goes beyond the commonly cited reason of forgetfulness. To date, eHealth (also known as mHealth and telehealth) interventions to improve medication adherence have largely been successful in improving adherence. However, interventions to date have used time- and cost-intensive strategies or focused solely on medication reminding, leaving much room for improvement in using a modality as flexible as eHealth.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop and implement a fully automated short message service (SMS)-based medication adherence system, EpxMedTracking, that reminds patients to take their medications, explores reasons for missed doses, and alerts providers to help address problems of medication adherence in real time.
METHODS: EpxMedTracking is a fully automated bidirectional SMS-based messaging system with provider involvement that was developed and implemented through Epharmix, Inc. Researchers analyzed 11 weeks of de-identified data from patients cared for by multiple provider groups in routine community practice for feasibility and functionality. Patients included were those in the care of a provider purchasing the EpxMedTracking tool from Epharmix and were enrolled from a clinic by their providers. The primary outcomes assessed were the rate of engagement with the system, reasons for missing doses, and self-reported medication adherence.
RESULTS: Of the 25 patients studied over the 11 weeks, 3 never responded and subsequently opted out or were deleted by their provider. No other patients opted out or were deleted during the study period. Across the 11 weeks of the study period, the overall weekly engagement rate was 85.9\%. There were 109 total reported missed doses including "I forgot" at 33 events (30.3\%), "I felt better" at 29 events (26.6\%), "out of meds" at 20 events (18.4\%), "I felt sick" at 19 events (17.4\%), and "other" at 3 events (2.8\%). We also noted an increase in self-reported medication adherence in patients using the EpxMedTracking system.
CONCLUSIONS: EpxMedTracking is an effective tool for tracking self-reported medication adherence over time. It uniquely identifies actionable reasons for missing doses for subsequent provider intervention in real time based on patient feedback. Patients enrolled on EpxMedTracking also self-report higher rates of medication adherence over time while on the system.},
