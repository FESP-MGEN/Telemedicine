AB: Chronic respiratory patients requiring oxygen or home mechanical ventilation experience frequent exacerbations and hospitalisations with related costs. Strict monitoring and care have been recommended. The aim of the present study was to primarily evaluate reduction in hospitalisations and, secondly, exacerbations, general practitioner (GP) calls and related cost‐effectiveness of tele‐assistance (TA) for these patients. A total of 240 patients (101 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) were randomised to two groups: an intervention group entered a 1‐yr TA programme while controls received traditional care. No anthropometric and clinical differences were found between groups both in baseline and in mortality (18% for TA, 23% for controls). Compared with controls, the TA group experienced significantly fewer hospitalisations (‐36%), urgent GP calls (‐65%) and acute exacerbations (‐71%). Only COPD patients, as a separate group, had fewer hospitalisations, emergency room admissions, urgent GP calls or exacerbations. Each patient referred to staff a mean+/‐sd 36+/‐25 times. After deduction of TA costs, the average overall cost for each patient was 33% less than that for usual care. In chronic respiratory failure patients on oxygen or home mechanical ventilation, a nurse‐centred tele‐assistance prevents hospitalisations while it is cost‐effective. The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease group seems to have a greater advantage from tele‐assistance.

AB: Background: Swaziland has one of the highest adult HIV prevalence rates worldwide, 27%; with approximately 200,000 people 15 years and older living with HIV. Swaziland and many other countries in sub‐Saharan Africa have adopted universal test‐and‐treat (UTT) policies. As the number of people needing and receiving ART in Swaziland is rapidly increasing, it is critical to understand the cost of UTT scale‐up and its implications for the health system. The study presented here is the first empirical longitudinal costing study of annual ART patient costs under a public‐sector UTT policy with routine viral load monitoring. Methods: We collected comprehensive monthly facility‐level data on ART patient costs from 14 facilities implementing UTT as part of a large‐scale randomized stepped‐wedge health systems trial (September 2014‐December 2016). In addition to a comprehensive time‐and‐motion study, we used extracted cost data from facility budgets, expenditure reports, and patient records. Items included in this “bottom‐up costing” included direct personnel, medications, laboratory services including viral load, and treatment for opportunistic infections (OI). We express all costs per patient per year (PPPY). Costs were converted from local currency to U.S. Dollars using annualized exchange rates. Results: Total ART costs PPPY were $214 (95% CI: 201‐226). ARVs costs accounted for the largest proportion at $102 (95% CI: 101‐103), followed by personnel $77 (95% CI: 67‐88), laboratory services (including viral load) $31 (95% CI: 27‐35) and OI costs $4 (95% CI: 3‐4). In the descriptive data (Figure 1) and in multilevel regression analysis controlling for time fixed effects and facility random effects, we identified strong economies of scale in the relationship between costs PPPY and facility size (measured in the number of visits per month). As facility size increases, costs initially decrease rapidly (from about $800 PPPY) and then plateau (below $200 PPPY) approximately at 250 patient visits. Conclusion: Swaziland's public‐sector ART program displays strong economies of scale under UTT, with far less efficiency achieved in clinics reaching less than 250 patient visits per month. In the context of scaling up UTT, increases in patient volumes are efficient trajectories but where not feasible (such as rural and remote populations), alternative delivery models could provide efficiency gains; including community health worker delivered ART.

AB: BACKGROUND: Patients with depression use more health services than patients without depression. However, when depression symptoms respond to treatment, use of health services declines. Most depression quality improvement studies increase total cost in the short run, which if unevenly distributed across stakeholders, could compromise buy‐in and sustainability. The objective of this budget impact analysis was to examine patterns of utilization and cost associated with telemedicine‐based collaborative care, an intervention that targets patients treated in small rural primary care clinics. METHODS: Patients with depression were recruited from VA Community‐based Outpatient Clinics, and 395 patients were enrolled and randomized to telemedicine‐based collaborative care or usual care. Dependent variables representing utilization and cost were collected from administrative data. Independent variables representing clinical casemix were collected from self‐report at baseline. RESULTS: There were no significant group differences in the total number or cost of primary care encounters. However, as intended, patients in the intervention group had significantly greater depression‐related primary care encounters (marginal effect=0.34, P=0.004) and cost (marginal effect=$61.4, P=0.013) to adjust antidepressant therapy for nonresponders. There were no significant group differences in total mental health encounters or cost. However, as intended, the intervention group had significantly higher depression‐related mental health costs (marginal effect=$107.55, P=0.03) due to referrals of treatment‐resistant patients. Unexpectedly, patients in the intervention group had significantly greater specialty physical health encounters (marginal effect =0.42, P=0.001) and cost (marginal effect =$490.6, P=0.003), but not depression‐related encounters or cost. Overall, intervention patients had a significantly greater total outpatient cost compared with usual care (marginal effect=$599.28, P=0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that telemedicine‐based collaborative care does not increase total workload for primary care or mental health providers. Thus, there is no disincentive for mental health providers to offer telemedicine‐based collaborative care or for primary care providers to refer patients to telemedicine‐based collaborative care.

YR: 2015
AB: Europe currently has the highest proportion of older people in the world and is expected to maintain this leading position for the next 50 years. Population ageing is a great challenge for public health care systems as well as for economic development. As nations age, the prevalence of disability, frailty, and chronic diseases is expected to increase dramatically. The hospital, which at the moment is the first choice for the delivery of acute medical care, is not an ideal environment for frail, elderly patients. New functional impairment and iatrogenic events such as nosocomial infections, pressure sores, falls and delirium, are common during hospital stay. With developments in medical and other technologies, people with very complex conditions can increasingly have the possibility to remain at home or in nursing homes rather than in hospital. Technologies can also improve the quality of life of patients and informal caregivers, allowing people to receive care and remain active at home and in the community, instead of being institutionalized. These societal changes, such as needs of health care cost reduction and an aging population, are the main driving force for the development of telemedicine, especially for elderly patients. Residents in nursing homes or patients treated at home by community care services are usually old or very old, multimorbid and often cognitively impaired. For these patients transportation to the hospital for X‐ray examinations may be an exhausting and disorienting experience. They are collected by an ambulance or taxi and taken away from their environment and people they know. Patients wait in hospital corridors to have a fairly simple X‐ray done and then wait for the pickup. The first objective of RADHOME is to move equipments instead of patients in order to give a response to the geriatric tsunami and to the demand for more flexible health services, providing a view to advancing the economic efficiency of this service. Teleradiology has become an essential part of the practice of radiology, with broad implications for care delivery and the organization of work: combining teleradiology and domiciliary X‐ray examination has the potential to greatly improve the quality of care for elderly frail patients with acute or chronic conditions. Until now no wide randomized study on radiology at home has been published. Hence main aim of this project is to carefully analyze feasibility, safety and cost‐effectiveness of a public, extra‐hospital and domiciliary radiology service for frail elderly or immobile patients, more vulnerable to environmental and social changes than other groups of patients, which health conditions discourage the transportation to hospital.

AB: BACKGROUND: The growing cost of health care and lack of specialised staff have set e‐Health high on the European political agenda. In a prospective study we evaluated the effect of providing images for remote consultation through an iPad on the number of in‐hospital orthopaedic consultations for children with bone fractures. METHODS: Children from 0 to 18 years diagnosed with a bone fracture by the radiologist during the hours when an orthopaedic service is provided only on‐call were eligible for enrollment. Cases were enrolled prospectively during September and October 2013. A standard approach (verbal information only, no X‐Ray provided remotely) was compared to an experimental approach (standard approach plus the provision of X‐ray for remote consultation through an iPad). The primary outcome was the number of orthopaedic in‐hospital consultations that occurred. Other outcomes included: immediate activation of other services; time needed for decision‐making; technical difficulties; quality of images and diagnostic confidence (on a likert scale of 1 to 10). RESULTS: Forty‐two children were enrolled in the study. Number of in‐hospital consultancies dropped from 32/42 (76.1%) when no X‐ray was provided to 16/42 (38%) when the X‐rays was provided (p < 0.001). With remote X‐ray consultation in 14/42 (33.3%) cases services such as surgery and plaster room could be immediately activated, compared to no service activated without teleradiology (p < 0.001). Average time for decision making was 23.4 +/‐ 21.8 minutes with remote X‐ray consultation, compared to 56.2 +/‐ 16.1 when the X‐ray was not provided (p < 0.001). The comparison between images on the iPad and on the standard system for X‐ Ray visualisation resulted in a non statistically significant difference in the quality of images (average score 9.89 +/‐ 0.37 vs 9.91 +/‐ 0.30; p = 0.79), and in non statistically significant difference in diagnostic confidence (average score 9.91 +/‐ 0.32 vs 9.92 +/‐ 0.31; p = 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Remote X‐ray consultation through Aycan OsiriX PRO and iPad should be considered as a means for reducing the need of in‐hospital orthopaedic consultation during on‐call times, and potentially decrease the cost of care for the health system. In the future, alternative systems less expensive than Aycan OsiriX PRO should be further developed and tested.

AB: : We analyze one‐year costs and savings of a telemedically supported case management program after kidney transplantation from the perspective of the German Healthcare System. Recipients of living donor kidney transplantation (N = 46) were randomly allocated to either (1) standard aftercare or (2) standard aftercare plus additional telemedically supported case management. A range of cost figures of each patient's medical service utilization were calculated at month 3, 6 and 12 and analyzed using two‐part regression models. In comparison to standard aftercare, patients receiving telemedically supported case management are associated with substantial lower costs related to unscheduled hospitalizations (mean difference: 3,417.46 per patient for the entire one‐year period, p = 0.003). Taking all cost figures into account, patients receiving standard aftercare are associated, on average, with one‐year medical service utilization costs of 10,449.28, while patients receiving telemedically supported case management are associated with 5,504.21 of costs (mean difference: 4,945.07 per patient, p < 0.001). With estimated expenditures of 3,001.5 for telemedically supported case management of a single patient, we determined a mean difference of 1,943.57, but this result is not statistically significant (p = 0.128). Sensitivity analyses show that the program becomes cost‐neutral at around ten participating patients, and was beneficial starting at 15 patients. Routine implementation of telemedically supported case management in German medium and high‐volume transplant centers would result in annual cost savings of 791,033 for the German healthcare system. Patients with telemedically supported case management showed a lower utilization of medical services as well as better medical outcomes. Therefore, such programs should be implemented in medium and high‐volume transplant centers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: DRKS00007634 ( http://www.drks.de/DRKS00007634 )

AB: Purpose: Emergency radiology requires rapid and accurate interpretation of imaging examinations. Missed findings may lead to adverse outcomes. Double reporting may be used to minimize errors. Limited contemporaneous double reporting may be most efficient and cost‐effective, but no data exists. This study is intended to examine the benefits of double reading and identify examinations where this would be most useful. Methods: In this study, dual reporting was conducted in a parallel reading environment in a teleradiology practice for 3779 radiological procedures performed at two radiology centers in the USA over a period of 4 months. Discrepancies between reads were scored using the ACR peer review scoring system and grouped by modality and body part. Errors were tabulated across the study types, followed by identification of statistically significant differences. The interaction between image number and odds of an error was ascertained. Results: In 145 instances (3.8%; 95 % CI, 3.2‐4.4%), double reporting identified errors, leading to report modification. Study type was significantly related to error frequency (p = 0.0001), with higher than average frequencies of error seen for CT abdomen and pelvis and MRI head or spine, but lower than average for CT head, CT spine, and ultrasound. Image number was positively associated with error odds, but was not independently significant in a joint logistic regression model that included study type. Conclusion: Dual reporting identifies missed findings in about 1 of 25 emergency studies. This benefit varies substantially across study types and limited double reporting, merits further investigation as a cost‐effective practice improvement strategy.

AB: AimsTo assess the cost‐effectiveness and the cost utility of remote patient monitoring (RPM) when compared with the usual care approach based upon differences in the number of hospitalizations, estimated from a meta‐analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs).Methods and resultsWe reviewed the literature published between January 2000 and September 2009 on multidisciplinary heart failure (HF) management, either by usual care or RPM to retrieve the number of hospitalizations and length of stay (LOS) for HF and for any cause. We performed a meta‐analysis of 21 RCTs (5715 patients). Remote patient monitoring was associated with a significantly lower number of hospitalizations for HF [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.77, 95 CI 0.650.91, P < 0.001] and for any cause (IRR: 0.87, 95 CI: 0.790.96, P 0.003), while LOS was not different. Direct costs for hospitalization for HF were approximated by diagnosis‐related group (DRG) tariffs in Europe and North America and were used to populate an economic model. The difference in costs between RPM and usual care ranged from €300 to €1000, favouring RPM. These cost savings combined with a quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) gain of 0.06 suggest that RPM is a 'dominant' technology over existing standard care. In a budget impact analysis, the adoption of an RPM strategy entailed a progressive and linear increase in costs saved.ConclusionsThe novel cost‐effectiveness data coupled with the demonstrated clinical efficacy of RPM should encourage its acceptance amongst clinicians and its consideration by third‐party payers. At the same time, the scientific community should acknowledge the lack of prospectively and uniformly collected economic data and should request that future studies incorporate economic analyses. © 2010 The Author.

AB: PURPOSE: Telemedicine provides patients with easy and remote access to consultant expertise irrespective of geographic location. In a randomized controlled trial, this study has applied a rigorous costing methodology to the use of telemedicine in chronic pain management. METHODS: We performed a randomized two‐period crossover trial comparing in‐person (IP) consultation with telemedicine (TM) consultation in the management of chronic pain. Over an 18‐month period, 26 patients each completed two diaries capturing their direct and indirect travel costs, daily pain scores, and satisfaction with physician consultation. Costing models were developed to account for direct, indirect, fixed, and variable costs in order to perform break‐even analyses. Sensitivity analysis was performed over a broad range of assumptions. RESULTS: Direct patient costs were significantly lower in the TM group than in the IP group, with median cost and interquartile range 133 dollars (28‐377) vs 443 dollars (292‐1075), respectively (P = 0.001). More patients were highly satisfied with the TM consultation than with the IP consultation (56 and 24%, respectively; P < 0.05). Break‐even annual patient volume was estimated at 57 patients. A two‐way sensitivity analysis controlling for annual patient volume and round‐trip distance indicated that TM remains cost‐effective at volumes >50 patients/year or at round‐trip distances >200 km. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine is cost‐effective over a broad range of assumptions, including annual patient volumes, travel distance, fuel costs, amortization, and discount rates. This study provides data from a real‐world setting to determine relevant thresholds and targets for establishing a TM program for patients who are undergoing chronic pain therapy.

AB: BACKGROUND: A web‐based followup assessment may be a feasible, cost‐saving alternative of tracking patient outcomes after total joint arthroplasty. However, before implementing a web‐based program, it is important to determine patient satisfaction levels with the new followup method. Satisfaction with the care received is becoming an increasingly important metric, and we do not know to what degree patients are satisfied with an approach to followup that does not involve an in‐person visit with their surgeons. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined (1) patient satisfaction and (2) patients' preferences for followup method (web‐based or in‐person) after total joint arthroplasty. METHODS: We randomized patients who were at least 12 months after primary THA or TKA to complete a web‐based followup or to have their appointment at the clinic. There were 410 eligible patients contacted for the study during the recruitment period. Of these, 256 agreed to participate, and a total of 229 patients completed the study (89% of those enrolled, 56% of those potentially eligible; 111 in the usual‐care group, 118 in the web‐based group). Their mean age was 69 years (range, 38‐86 years). There was no crossover between groups. All 229 patients completed a satisfaction questionnaire at the time of their followup appointments. Patients in the web‐based group also completed a satisfaction and preference questionnaire 1 year later. Only patients from the web‐based group were asked to indicate preference as they had experienced the web‐based and in‐person followup methods. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the satisfaction questionnaires and compared results using Pearson's chi‐square test. RESULTS: Ninety‐one patients (82.0%) in the usual‐care group indicated that they were either extremely or very satisfied with the followup process compared with 90 patients (75.6%) who were in the web‐based group (p < 0.01; odds ratio [OR] = 3.95; 95% CI, 1.79‐8.76). Similarly, patients in the usual care group were more satisfied with the care they received from their surgeon, compared with patients in the web‐based group (92.8% versus 73.9%; p < 0.01, OR = 1.37; 95% CI, 0.73‐2.57). Forty‐four percent of patients preferred the web‐based method, 36% preferred the usual method, and 16% had no preference (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show moderate to high satisfaction levels with a web‐based followup assessment. Patients who completed the usual method of in‐person followup assessment reported greater satisfaction; however, the difference was small and may not outweigh the additional cost and time‐saving benefits of the web‐based followup method. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, therapeutic study. See the Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB: Background: Common mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and somatisation are associated with long‐term sickness absence. Routine care, as offered by mental health services (MHS), has little effect on sick leave duration. Therefore it is important to explicitly focus on return‐to‐work during treatment. For that purpose, a blended e‐health module was developed and embedded in a collaborative occupational and mental health care model: the ECO intervention. ECO comprises two parts: one for the employee, aimed at changing cognitions of the employee regarding return‐to‐work, and another part supporting the occupational physician (OP) with a decision aid for advice regarding treatment, psychiatric consultation and referral options to MHS based on monitoring of the employee's progress during treatment. Aims of the Study: To evaluate the ECO intervention compared to care as usual (CAU) in terms of cost‐utility and cost‐benefits (net‐benefits) from the perspective of (i) patient/employee, (ii) health care system, and (iii) employer. Methods cluster randomized controlled trial in two parallel groups, with randomisation at the level of OPs. A total of 220 sicklisted employees with CMD were enrolled and an economic evaluation was performed. Results: Preliminary results show that both ECO and CAU improved health‐related quality of life: in both conditions utilities (derived from the EuroQoL, EQ‐5D‐3L) increased from 0.60 to a much better 0.76, with improvements equally large in both conditions. However, ECO (costing €300 per recipient) was associated with a 64% likelihood to be dominant (less costly and associated with more health gains than CAU), with net‐benefits of €1,518 (95% CI: 587∼2,450) per patient per year from the health care perspective, €8,470 (95% CI: 3,397∼13,544) from the employer's perspective, and net‐benefits of €183 from the patient perspective. The latter is surrounded by uncertainty (95% CI:‐203∼569). Discussion: A dedicated return‐to‐work intervention offers good value for money in a group of sick‐listed employees with common mental disorders. Limitations are that the study suffered from dropout and our intention‐to‐treat analyses relied on imputation, but different imputation strategies produced very similar results, which attests to the robustness of our findings. Implications for Health Care Provision: It is recommended that mental health services offer dedicated and integrated return‐to‐work interventions for employees on sick leave, preferably in close collaboration with OPs. Implications for Health Policies: In the current economic climate it is important that mental health services make an effort to become economically more relevant. Offering interventions that have a high return‐on‐investment and can be regarded as good business propositions for employers are key. Implications for Research: In the same vein, health economic evaluation should perhaps be more geared toward (societal) cost‐benefit analyses to become more politically relevant and informative.

YR: 2012
AB: This study is one of the first European randomized studies using the criteria MAST (Model for Assessment of Telemedicine) for medico‐economic evaluation of technology solutions for the prevention and care in the elderly. The medico‐economic evaluation of the overall contribution of home automation kit associated with telecare will be conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the research program Renewing Health FP7 the European Union. This program has developed an analytical model common to all evaluations of telemedicine applications that have an impact on health. . The home‐based technology in this study will be a simple home automation pack coupled to teleassistance service. The automation pack will include: a remote intercom, an electronic bracelet or pendentive, a pull shower in the bathroom, a light path, a smoke detector and a gas detector in the kitchen. The central hotline will provide telephone support at all times. Intercom is a remote transmitter which enables the platform to provide remote assistance with the elderly at home. Each person will have electronic bracelet or pendentive with a medallion which will be provided with the dialer. It is a system that allows remote assistance to the elderly by pressing the central medallion of the device to request assistance or report a dangerous situation (risk of falling, or fall) to the platform of teleassistance. The bathroom alarm zipper is a device installed in the shower that allows subjects to use it when at risk of falling or fall detection. The shower is a high risk of fall for the elderly due to movements very often results in an imbalance of seniors already weakened by aging. The light path is a 1.5 m device installed near the bed and turns automatically on when the person sets foot on the ground. It can provide adapted visibility by showing the right path and improving consciousness. The smoke and gas detector are devices installed on the ceiling of the kitchen. They allow respectively detecting abnormally high rates of smoke or a gas leak in the house or apartment. The teleassistance platform is a central technical hotline located in Creuse area. It is functional at any time. All electronic devices are connected to the plant. An alert is signaled by an alarm, involving an immediate phone call to the resident of the house to assess the situation. The resulting actions taken are either reassuring the person, giving directions to the person or sending a message to aid in the event ascertained or suspected. A monthly questionnary should be filled by patients. Primary outcome: The main judgment criterion will be the cumulated incidence of home falls requiring emergency admission. Secondary outcomes: 1. Changes score ISO profile resource according to SMAF scale, 2. Proportion of participants with regular physical activity 3. Effect on admissions in institutions (nursing homes or senior residential care) 4. Time before management of stroke and the length of stay in rehabilitation unit.

AB: BACKGROUND: Self‐management is crucial to successful glycemic control in patients with diabetes, yet it requires patients to initiate and sustain complicated behavioral changes. Support programs can improve glycemic control, but may be expensive to implement. We report here an analysis of the costs of a successful telephone‐based self‐management support program delivered by lay health educators utilizing a municipal health department A1c registry, and relate them to near‐term effectiveness. METHODS: Costs of implementation were assessed by micro‐costing of all resources used. Per‐capita costs and cost‐effectiveness ratios from the perspective of the service provider are estimated for net A1c reduction, and percentages of patients achieving A1c reductions of 0.5 and 1.0 percentage points. One‐way sensitivity analyses of key cost elements, and a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis are reported. RESULTS: The telephone intervention was provided to 443 people at a net cost of $187.61 each. Each percentage point of net A1c reduction was achieved at a cost of $464.41. Labor costs were the largest component of costs, and cost‐effectiveness was most sensitive to the wages paid to the health educators. CONCLUSIONS: Effective telephone‐based self‐management support for people in poor diabetes control can be delivered by health educators at moderate cost relative to the gains achieved. The costs of doing so are most sensitive to the prevailing wage for the health educators.

AB: Objectives: To estimate the cost‐effectiveness of home telemonitoring (TM) or structured telephone support (STS) strategies versus usual care for adults recently discharged (within 28 days) after a heart failure (HF) exacerbation in England and Wales. Methods: A Markov model was used to evaluate a) STS via human to machine (HM) interface, b) STS via human to human (HH) contact, and c) TM, against d) usual care. Given heterogeneity in the interventions, cost‐effectiveness analysis was performed using bottom up costing scenarios regarding costs of devices, monitoring and medical care to deal with alerts. Costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 30 year (patient lifetime) horizon were estimated based on monthly probabilities of death and monthly risks of hospitalisations (HF‐related complications or other causes) estimated from clinical effectiveness parameters computed using a network meta‐analysis of randomised controlled trials. Results: Base case monthly costs per patient were: £27 for usual care, £119 for STS HM, £179 for STS HH and £175 for TM. TM was the most cost‐effective strategy in the scenario using these base case costs. Compared with usual care, TM had an estimated incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £9,552/QALY, whereas STS HH had an ICER of £63,240/ QALY against TM. STS HM was dominated by usual care. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) showed 44% chance of TM being cost‐effective at a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY, with STS HH 36%, STS HM 18% and usual care 2%, respectively. Scenario analyses performed using higher costs of usual care higher costs of STS HH and lower costs of TM do not substantially change the conclusions. Conclusions: Cost‐effectiveness analyses suggest TM was an optimal strategy in most scenarios, but there is considerable uncertainty in relation to clear descriptions of the interventions and robust estimation of costs.

Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) showed 44% chance of TM being costeffective with STS HH 36%, STS HM 18% and usual care 2%, respectively. Threshold analysis suggested that the monthly cost of TM has to be higher than £390 to have an ICER greater than £20,000/QALY against STS HH. Scenario analyses performed using higher costs of usual care, higher costs of STS HH and lower costs of TM do not substantially change the conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Cost‐effectiveness analyses suggest TM was an optimal strategy in most scenarios, but there is considerable uncertainty in relation to clear descriptions of the interventions and robust estimation of costs.

AB: Lack of access to self‐management education is a barrier to care for patients with diabetes in rural areas. A randomized, controlled, clinical trial evaluated the cost‐effectiveness of a 12‐month remote DSME program that increased the availability of a CDE, a dietitian, and provided remotecamera retinal screening to patients with diabetes in rural community in South Carolina. Adults with type 2 diabetes were randomized (n=165; 85 intervention and 80 usual care). The intervention was conducted in‐person and remotely in single and group formats. Usual care consisted of one education session by a CDE lasting about 15 minutes followed by approximately 4 hours of education by a health educator. Data were collected prospectively on clinical outcomes, health utilities, resource utilization, and costs. (Table presented) Cost‐effectiveness may be understood in terms of its incremental cost relative to the incremental improvement in A1c, LDL‐cholesterol, and eye exam rates. The incremental cost of the DTC intervention relative to usual care was $1,380 over one year. The investment of $1,380 over one year bought a 0.6% absolute improvement in A1c and a 11 mg/dL absolute decrease in LDL‐cholesterol. The incremental cost of the DTC educational intervention relative to usual care was less than the annual cost of adding a third‐line pharmacologic agent to improve glycemia. The cost‐utility for the combined DTC educational intervention and screening eye exam compared to no intervention would then be approximately $17,000 per QALY‐gained over 1 year. Interventions costing less than $50,000 per QALY‐gained are generally considered being cost‐effective. This investment thus represents a good value for the money spent.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the health‐economic costs and benefits of a guided eHealth intervention (E‐health module embedded in Collaborative Occupational healthcare (ECO)) encouraging sick‐listed employees to a faster return to work. DESIGN: A two‐armed cluster randomised trial with occupational physicians (OPs) (n=62), clustered and randomised by region into an experimental and a control group, to conduct a health‐economic investment appraisal. Online self‐reported data were collected from employees at baseline, after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. SETTING: Occupational health care in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Employees from small‐sized and medium‐sized companies (≥18 years), sick‐listed between 4 and 26 weeks with (symptoms of) common mental disorders visiting their OP. INTERVENTIONS: In the intervention group, employees (N=131) received an eHealth module aimed at changing cognitions regarding return to work, while OPs were supported by a decision aid for treatment and referral options. Employees in the control condition (N=89) received usual sickness guidance. OUTCOMES MEASURES: Net benefits and return on investment based on absenteeism, presenteeism, health care use and quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: From the employer's perspective, the incremental net benefits were €3187 per employee over a single year, representing a return of investment of €11 per invested Euro, with a break‐even point at 6 months. The economic case was also favourable from the employee's perspective, partly because of QALY health gains. The intervention was costing €234 per employee from a health service financier's perspective. The incremental net benefits from a social perspective were €4210. This amount dropped to €3559 in the sensitivity analysis trimming the 5% highest costs. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the ECO intervention offers good value for money for virtually all stakeholders involved, because initial investments were more than recouped within a single year. The sometimes wide 95% CIs suggest that the costs and benefits are not always very precise estimates and real benefits could vary considerably. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR2108; Results.

AB: AIM: Remote follow‐up (FU) of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) allows for fewer in‐office visits in combination with earlier detection of relevant findings. Its implementation requires investment and reorganization of care. Providers (physicians or hospitals) are unsure about the financial impact. The primary end‐point of this randomized prospective multicentre health economic trial was the total FU‐related cost for providers, comparing Home Monitoring facilitated FU (HM ON) to regular in‐office FU (HM OFF) during the first 2 years after ICD implantation. Also the net financial impact on providers (taking national reimbursement into account) and costs from a healthcare payer perspective were evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 312 patients with VVI‐ or DDD‐ICD implants from 17 centres in six EU countries were randomised to HM ON or OFF, of which 303 were eligible for data analysis. For all contacts (in‐office, calendar‐ or alert‐triggered web‐based review, discussions, calls) time‐expenditure was tracked. Country‐specific cost parameters were used to convert resource use into monetary values. Remote FU equipment itself was not included in the cost calculations. Given only two patients from Finland (one in each group) a monetary valuation analysis was not performed for Finland. Average age was 62.4 ± 13.1 years, 81% were male, 39% received a DDD system, and 51% had a prophylactic ICD. Resource use with HM ON was clearly different: less FU visits (3.79 ± 1.67 vs. 5.53 ± 2.32; P < 0.001) despite a small increase of unscheduled visits (0.95 ± 1.50 vs. 0.62 ± 1.25; P < 0.005), more non‐office‐based contacts (1.95 ± 3.29 vs. 1.01 ± 2.64; P < 0.001), more Internet sessions (11.02 ± 15.28 vs. 0.06 ± 0.31; P < 0.001) and more in‐clinic discussions (1.84 ± 4.20 vs. 1.28 ± 2.92; P < 0.03), but with numerically fewer hospitalizations (0.67 ± 1.18 vs. 0.85 ± 1.43, P = 0.23) and shorter length‐of‐stay (6.31 ± 15.5 vs. 8.26 ± 18.6; P = 0.27), although not significant. For the whole study population, the total FU cost for providers was not different for HM ON vs. OFF [mean (95% CI): €204 (169‐238) vs. €213 (182‐243); range for difference (€‐36 to 54), NS]. From a payer perspective, FU‐related costs were similar while the total cost per patient (including other physician visits, examinations, and hospitalizations) was numerically (but not significantly) lower. There was no difference in the net financial impact on providers [profit of €408 (327‐489) vs. €400 (345‐455); range for difference (€‐104 to 88), NS], but there was heterogeneity among countries, with less profit for providers in the absence of specific remote FU reimbursement (Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands) and maintained or increased profit in cases where such reimbursement exists (Germany and UK). Quality of life (SF‐36) was not different. CONCLUSION: For all the patients as a whole, FU‐related costs for providers are not different for remote FU vs. purely in‐office FU, despite reorganized care. However, disparity in the impact on provider budget among different countries illustrates the need for proper reimbursement to ensure effective remote FU implementation.

AB: Aim Remote follow‐up (FU) of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) allows for fewer in‐office visits in combination with earlier detection of relevant findings. Its implementation requires investment and reorganization of care. Providers (physicians or hospitals) are unsure about the financial impact. The primary end‐point of this randomized prospective multicentre health economic trial was the total FU‐related cost for providers, comparing Home Monitoring facilitated FU (HM ON) to regular in‐office FU (HM OFF) during the first 2 years after ICD implantation. Also the net financial impact on providers (taking national reimbursement into account) and costs from a healthcare payer perspective were evaluated. Methods and results A total of 312 patients with VVI‐ or DDD‐ICD implants from 17 centres in six EU countries were randomised to HM ON or OFF, of which 303 were eligible for data analysis. For all contacts (in‐office, calendar‐ or alert‐triggered web‐based review, discussions, calls) time‐expenditure was tracked. Country‐specific cost parameters were used to convert resource use into monetary values. Remote FU equipment itself was not included in the cost calculations. Given only two patients from Finland (one in each group) a monetary valuation analysis was not performed for Finland. Average age was 62.4 ± 13.1 years, 81% were male, 39% received a DDD system, and 51% had a prophylactic ICD. Resource use with HM ON was clearly different: less FU visits (3.79 ± 1.67 vs. 5.53 ± 2.32; P < 0.001) despite a small increase of unscheduled visits (0.95 ± 1.50 vs. 0.62 ± 1.25; P < 0.005), more non‐office‐based contacts (1.95 ± 3.29 vs. 1.01 ± 2.64; P < 0.001), more Internet sessions (11.02 ± 15.28 vs. 0.06 ± 0.31; P < 0.001) and more in‐clinic discussions (1.84 ± 4.20 vs. 1.28 ± 2.92; P < 0.03), but with numerically fewer hospitalizations (0.67 ± 1.18 vs. 0.85 ± 1.43, P = 0.23) and shorter length‐of‐stay (6.31 ± 15.5 vs. 8.26 ± 18.6; P = 0.27), although not significant. For the whole study population, the total FU cost for providers was not different for HM ON vs. OFF [mean (95% CI): 204 (169‐238) vs. 213 (182‐243); range for difference (‐36 to 54), NS]. From a payer perspective, FU‐related costs were similar while the total cost per patient (including other physician visits, examinations, and hospitalizations) was numerically (but not significantly) lower. There was no difference in the net financial impact on providers [profit of 408 (327‐489) vs. 400 (345‐455); range for difference (‐104 to 88), NS], but there was heterogeneity among countries, with less profit for providers in the absence of specific remote FU reimbursement (Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands) and maintained or increased profit in cases where such reimbursement exists (Germany and UK). Quality of life (SF‐36) was not different. Conclusion For all the patients as a whole, FU‐related costs for providers are not different for remote FU vs. purely in‐office FU, despite reorganized care. However, disparity in the impact on provider budget among different countries illustrates the need for proper reimbursement to ensure effective remote FU implementation.

AB: Background: There is a lack of information on effective therapies for patients with heart failure (HF) with mid‐range (HFmrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Whether these subtypes of patients with heart failure would benefit from a telemedicine‐based management has not been studied. Methods: In this study, 116 eligible patients with HFmrEF (LVEF 40‐49%, 27 patients) or HFpEF (LVEF ≥50%, 89 patients) were randomized to either structured follow‐up in the basis of face‐to‐face encounters (usual care group‐UC‐, 66 patients) or delivering healthcare using telemedicine (TM, 50 patients). Telemedicine included daily signs and symptoms telemonitoring and structured follow‐up by the means of video or audio‐conference. The primary end‐point was non‐fatal HF events after 6 months of follow‐up. Cost calculations were based on full‐costing allocation to assess direct costs derived from clinical activity. Results: The mean (SD) age of the patients was 77 (10) years, mean (SD) LVEF was 58% (10), 47% were female, and 28% were frail patients. In Cox proportional hazards models, the hazard ratio for the primary end‐point was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.17‐0.64; p‐value=0.001) in favour of telemedicine. Similars results were seen when event risk was analysed in 4 groups (UC+HFmrEF, UC+HFpF, TM+HFmrEF, TM+HFpEF; figure 1, p‐value=0.011). HF readmission (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% CI [0.16‐0.89); p‐value=0.027]) and cardiovascular readmission (hazard ratio 0.40, 95% CI [0.19‐0.86]; p‐value=0.019) were also reduced in the telemedicine group. Mortality was similar in both groups (telemedicine: 6.0% vs. control: 12.1%, p‐value=0.346). The telemedicine group experienced a significant mean net reduction in direct costs of Δ3,170 per patient per 6 months of followup (p‐value=0.001). This reduction was mainly driven by a relative reduction of 55% in the cost associated with re‐hospitalizations (p‐value=0.006). There was no significant interaction between allocation arm (telemedicine vs. usual care) and LVEF category (HFmrEF vs. HFpEF) (p‐value>0.1) neither for clinical events nor reduction in costs.

AB: BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation programs at health care facilities are effective but under‐used. Telephone quit lines provide easy access but only a small portion of smokers contact quit lines for help. Costeffective methods are needed to increase use of smoking‐cessation care. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial enrolled 836 veterans at five VA medical centers from June, 2001 to December, 2002. The telephonecare group received behavioral counseling by telephone and medications by mail. Usual care consisted of standard treatment at VA medical centers. At 12 months participants were assessed for continuous abstinence over the prior sixmonths. Clinical resultspublished earlier revealedsignificantly greater long‐termabstinence in the telephone‐care group (13.0%vs. 4.1%). The present study determined the relative cost‐effectiveness of telephone care from the VA perspective over a lifetime horizon. There were 819 usable observations. Case report forms captured demographic information, clinical data, and 12‐monthoutcomes. Use and cost of VA services during the 12months after enrollment were extracted fromthe VA Decision Support System. VA Fee Basis files were searched for care purchased by VA from outside vendors. Intervention costs were derived through micro‐costing. Our primary outcome was cost per life‐year gained. We assumed 1.2 life years per quit based on a recent international review. An initial intent‐totreat analysis treated decedents and persons lost to follow‐up assmokers.A second analysis excluded the 15 decedents because no deaths were studyrelated. The final analysis employed regression‐based multiple imputation to complete missing values of smoking abstinence based on baseline characteristics, again excluding decedents. We used bootstrapping to determine the 95th percentile of costs per life‐year. Cost figures are reported in 2008 dollars. Discounting was deemed unnecessary due to the short study timeframe. All analyses were carried out in Stata 10. RESULTS: The intervention cost $123 (s.d. $31) per person on average. Mean total cost of all VA care received during the study period was $6,210 ($14,329) in the telephone‐care arm and $5,776 ($12,841) in usual care (n.s.). Inpatient and outpatient costs were both greater in the intervention arm but differences were never significant at conventional levels. Under the intent‐to‐treat analysis the average cost per quit was $5,667, or $4,723 per life‐year. Ninety‐five percent of bootstrapped values fell at≤$21,300 per life‐year. Excluding decedents raised the 95% threshold to≤$22,300 but applying multiple imputation lowered it to ≤ $19,000. CONCLUSIONS: The telephone care intervention is cost‐effective by conventional standards. Under a conservative assumption of 0.50 utility for life‐years gained, the telephone‐care intervention would still fall below $50,000 per QALY. We assume no cost difference between arms after 12 months in present discounted value. This is conservative because smokers incur greater costs for many years. We also assume that relapsers are exactly offset by new quitters after 12months. A sensitivity analysiswill vary these assumptions. Recent research showed that treating people with missing outcomes as smokers is not necessarily conservative. In our study using multiple imputation raised clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness. This approach should be treated as the standard for smoking‐cessation trials.

KY: Depression; Depressive Disorder
AB: The long‐term objective of the proposed study is to improve access to depression treatments for low‐income, racially diverse homebound seniors, a population experiencing significant disparities in mental health care due to their homebound and low‐income status. Specific aims are to compare the acceptability, clinical effectiveness, treatment cost, and budget impact of the two teledelivered treatment delivery models: problem‐solving therapy (PST) by licensed clinicians and self‐care management (SCM) support by trained lay mental health workers/advisors. The interventionists will be integrated into an aging‐service agency; hence, integrated tele‐PST (IT‐PST) ad integrated tele‐SCM (IT‐SCM). Although tele‐psychotherapy is likely to be an effective mental health service delivery model for the target population, the current and projected shortage of such clinicians and the costs of deploying highly trained professionals pose barriers to this model's widespread real‐world adoption and sustainability. A more plausible option may indeed have to utilize trained lay mental health workers. The study participants will be 276 low‐income, racially diverse homebound seniors who are served by a home‐delivered meal (HDM) program and other aging‐service agencies in Austin, Tex. In a 3‐arm, pragmatic clinical trial with randomization prior to consent (a preferred public health approach), the participants will receive five sessions of IT‐PST, five sessions of IT‐SCM, or five telephone check‐in calls (for the usual care‐UC‐group). Our first hypothesis is that IT‐PST and IT‐SCM will be equally acceptable to the participants. Our second hypothesis is that both IT‐PST and IT‐SCM will be more effective than UC in reducing depressive symptoms, although IT‐PST may be more effective than IT‐SCM. Symptoms will be assessed with the 24‐item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) at 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Additional outcomes will be depression‐free days (DFDs) and disability (WHODAS 2.0). Our third hypothesis is that IT‐SCM will have a lower delivery cost than IT‐PST, but both IT‐PST and IT‐SCM will be more cost‐effective than usual care. The analyses include (a) comparisons of delivery costs between IT‐PST and IT‐SCM; (b) assessment of cost‐effectiveness (CEA) based on DFDs and health‐related quality adjusted life‐year measured by EuroQol‐5 (EQ‐5D); and (3) budget impact (BIA) of IT‐PST relative to IT‐SCM. Both CEA and BIA will employ a hybrid public program perspective of the AoA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Public health significance of this study is that the data will help aging‐service providers and funders assess respective strengths and weaknesses of each model as a sustainable approach to providing depression care for an underserved and growing population group and improving their access to evidence‐based mental health services. (The terms older adults and seniors are used interchangeably because the latter term is frequently used in aging services.)

TI: DVD Lifestyle Intervention
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03260140
YR: 2017
AB: More than a third of US Veterans who receive care through the VHA are obese, putting them at higher risk for multiple serious chronic health conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and stroke. Losing even small amounts of weight can reduce the risks associated with those conditions. Lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of weight loss treatment. While efficacious lifestyle interventions for obesity exist, finding evidence‐based programs that are scalable, cost‐efficient, and serves a diverse VA population is a priority for the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP). In response, VA disseminated MOVE! Weight Management Program for Veterans (MOVE!) in 2006, a comprehensive, evidenced‐based intervention that combines diet and physical activity counseling with behavior change strategies. MOVE! results in meaningful weight loss for those who actively engage in the program, but less than 5% of Veterans eligible for the program participate, and among those, few participate at a level that would result in meaningful weight loss. To address the growing burden that obesity places on Veterans and the health care system, VA now faces the challenge to improve access to comprehensive lifestyle interventions using a patient‐centered and population‐based approach. The investigators aim to fill this gap by producing evidence on the effectiveness of a proven 12‐month pragmatic DVD‐based self‐directed lifestyle intervention targeting modest, clinically meaningful weight loss and increased physical activity among obese Veterans. The curriculum, aimed at gradual weight loss through progressive healthful changes in diet quality and physical activity and behavioral skills training, is grounded in the Diabetes Prevention Program's (DPP) Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) 12‐session DVD. The program encourages supplementary goal setting and self‐monitoring via the Heart360 website, and optional remote lifestyle coaching. The investigators propose to leverage the VA's Corporate Data Warehouse to identify and enroll 500 obese Veterans. The investigators will randomize participants to receive usual care or the lifestyle intervention. As primary outcomes, the investigators will test whether, compared with usual care controls, intervention participants have better outcomes through 12 months of follow‐up on weight loss and self‐reported physical function. Secondary outcomes through 24 months include sustained weight loss, physical function, physical activity, sedentary behavior, diet quality, blood pressure, sleep quality, self‐efficacy, and program reach. Dissemination work with NCP includes development of toolkits and budget impact analyses. The investigators hypothesize that intervention participants will have more weight loss and improved physical function, as well as improvements in physical activity, sedentary behavior, diet quality, blood pressure, sleep quality, and self‐efficacy.

TI: TeleMonitoring to Improve Substance Use Disorder Treatment After Detoxification
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02269787
YR: 2014
KY: Substance‐Related Disorders
AB: Annually, about 25,000 Veterans receive inpatient detoxification (detox) for substance use disorders (SUDs). Detox is not SUD treatment; it is the medical management of withdrawal to prevent complications, which may be fatal. Detox inpatients who enter SUD treatment and peer‐based mutual‐help groups (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous) have much better outcomes (less substance use, HIV/HCV risk behaviors, homelessness, rehospitalizations, Emergency Department visits) than those who do not. However, because of their unique characteristics (severe and chronic addictions, co‐morbidities, lack of resources, self‐ and provider‐perceptions as unsuitable for treatment), most Veterans discharged from inpatient detox do not enter SUD treatment. For many Veterans, a pattern of repeated inpatient detox, with each episode incurring a higher risk of overdose, occurs. Therefore, in its Uniform Services Handbook, Mental Health Operations places major emphasis on increasing the rate of SUD treatment initiation and engagement following detox to benefit Veterans' outcomes and prevent more use of costly health care. The primary objective of this project is to implement and evaluate Enhanced Telephone Monitoring (ETM) as a new and innovative telehealth intervention to facilitate the transition from inpatient detox to SUD specialty treatment (residential, outpatient, pharmacotherapy), thereby improving Veterans' outcomes and decreasing VA health care costs. In a randomized trial at two sites (VA Palo Alto and Boston), investigators hypothesize that patients receiving ETM, compared to patients in usual care (UC), will be more likely to enter and engage in SUD treatment and mutual‐help, have better SUD and related outcomes, and have fewer and delayed acute care episodes. This project will also conduct a formative evaluation of how to implement ETM VA‐wide, focusing on diverse subgroups of Veterans. Further, it will conduct a Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) to determine the impact of ETM on total costs of VA care. Investigators hypothesize that the higher costs associated with ETM (because patients will engage in SUD treatment) will be more than offset by its lower costs of acute care. Patients in the ETM condition will receive an in‐person session while in detox, followed by coaching over the telephone for 3 months after discharge. The intervention will incorporate Motivational Interviewing, and Contracting, Prompting, and Reinforcing, to provide support while waiting for treatment, and facilitate entry into treatment and mutual‐help, and improved responses to crises. Patients will be assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months post‐discharge for outcomes and non‐VA health care; VA health care will be assessed with VA databases. GLMM analyses will be conducted to compare the UC and ETM groups on course of outcomes over time. The formative evaluation to inform the implementation of ETM will use the RE‐AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework. Semi‐structured interviews will be conducted with inpatient detox staff and patients to yield facilitators of ETM implementation and modifiable barriers with associated action plans. For the BIA, costs of ETM will be measured through microcosting methods. For patients in both the ETM and UC groups, all inpatient, residential, outpatient, and pharmacy care will be measured from VA utilization and cost files. In summary, Mental Health Operations is committed to eradicating the dangerous, costly pattern of Veterans obtaining inpatient detox services but not receiving the SUD treatment they need. Telehealth interventions, a promising way to improve treatment access and outcomes by SUD patients, have not been utilized with the challenging population of detox inpatients before. In accordance with others in this CREATE, this project will help to accomplish Mental Health Operations' goal of implementing the Uniform Handbook by increasing Veterans' access to, engagement in, and benefit from, SUD treatment services, particularly among Veterans who are using VA medical services and need SUD services but are not receiving them.

SO: Http://www.who.int/trialsearch/trial2.aspx? Trialid=isrctn94074203
YR: 2018
AB: INTERVENTION: Randomisation is done at the level of the participating physical therapy practices. Participating primary care physical therapy practices will be randomized by an independent researcher to either the intervention group or the usual care (control) group by a computer‐generated random sequence table generated using SPSS. Through cluster randomization, the possibility of professionals offering both experimental and usual care intervention is avoided and/or that professionals who offer the experimental or usual care intervention within one physical therapy practice will influence each other (contamination‐effect). Participants in the intervention group are stratified into 3 different groups based on the risk to develop persistent low back pain. All participants in the intervention group are treated using a blended care approach (e‐Exercise), in which online e‐health modules are an integral part of face‐to‐face physical therapy treatment ‐ face‐to‐face care by a physical therapist, supported by a smartphone app. The stratification of the patients in this group means that the support of the app can differ based upon the risk profile of the patient ‐ e‐Exercise is tailored to the patients’ individual needs, based on their prognostic risk for developing persistent LBP, as determined by the Keele STarT Back Screening Tool. The e‐Exercise low back pain program is an app containing information and self‐management modules, a home‐based exercise module and offers remote support to increase adherence to physical activity and exercise recommendations. The online modules consist of (1) video‐based LBP self‐management information, (2) an individualized home‐based exercise program including instruction videos and (3) a physical activity module to maintain or improve patients’ individual level of physical activity, based on the principles of graded activity. The control group receive usual care according to the recommendations of the guideline LBP of the Royal Dutch Association for P CONDITION: Non‐specific low back pain ; Musculoskeletal Diseases ; Non‐specific low back pain (nsLBP) PRIMARY OUTCOME: 1. Short‐term improvement of low‐back‐related physical functioning assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index version 2.1a at the baseline, after 3 months, after 12 months and after 24 months; 2. Long‐term reduction of low‐back‐pain‐related costs assessed using 8 retrospective cost questionnaires every 3 months from the baseline to the 24 months follow‐up. Cost effectiveness is determined after 12 months and after 24 months, based on patient's healthcare utilisation and (unpaid) productivity losses due to LBP (based on responses to the cost questionnaires). Healthcare utilization will be valued using Dutch standards costs. If these are unavailable, prices reported by professional organizations will be used. Unpaid productivity losses will be valued in accordance with the “Dutch Manual of Costing”. Paid productivity losses comprise of both sickness absence and presenteeism (i.e. reduced productivity while at work). Sickness absence will be valued in accordance with the “Friction Cost Approach” (FCA), with a friction period of 23 weeks and an elasticity of 0.8, using age‐ and gender‐specific price weights. The FCA assumes that production losses are confined to the “friction period” (i.e. time needed to replace a sick worker) and that a 100 percent loss of labor input corresponds with an 80 percent reduction in productivity (i.e. an elasticity of 0.8)(63). The participants’ level of presenteeism will be measured using the “World Health Organization – Work Performance Questionnaire” as well as the “Productivity and Disease Questionnaire”, and valued using age‐ and gender specific price weights. The costs of e‐Exercise LBP will be estimated using a bottom‐up microcosting approach. SECONDARY OUTCOME: The following will be assessed at the baseline, after 3 months, after 12 months and at the 24 months follow‐up:; 1. Pain intensity, assessed using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS); 2. Physical activity, assessed using Activ8 activity monitor; 3. Adherence to prescribed home exercises, assessed using Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS) and Utrecht Home‐based Exercise Adherence Questionnaire (UHAQ). EARS is a self‐reported questionnaire and UHAQ is an interview‐based questionnaire, which will be used by the physical therapist during face‐to‐face care, to determine qualitative performance of the recommended recommended home exercises and the agreement between recommended home exercises and patient reported adherence; 4. Psychological function, assessed using the Fear‐Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS); 5. Self‐efficacy, assessed using the Generalized Self‐Efficacy (GSE) scale; 6. Self‐management skills, assessed using the Dutch version of the Pain Activation Measure (PAM13‐Dutch); 7. Health‐related quality of life, assessed using the EQ‐5D‐5L; 8. Risk of developing persistent low back pain, assessed using the STarT Back Tool (SBT); 9. Central sensitivity, assessed using the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI); 10. Usability of the e‐Exercise low back pain app, assessed using the System Usability Scale (SUS); ; 11. Number of recurrent low back pain episodes, assessed every 3 months from the baseline until the 24 months follow‐up. This is measured using the number of self‐reported LBP episodes during the follow‐up period (a recurrent LBP episode is defined as return of LBP with a minimum duration of 24 hours with a minimum pain intensity of 3 or more on the NRS since the date of recovery. For recovery, a minimum duration of 4 weeks pain‐free is used) INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Applying for physical therapy for LBP 2. Aged 18 years or older 3.

AB: Background and aims: Estimates show that there are 35.6 million people with dementia (PwD) worldwide. This prevalence rate is expected to rise with increased life expectancy. This could pose a challenge to health systems, so newways ofmanaging dementia need to be considered. Around 40% ofPwD reside in care homes, costing over $315 billion worldwide, and the 60% in the community are mainly supported by informal carers. The aim of this project was to evaluate 'telemedicine' for remote monitoring of the cognitive and behavioral state of PwD and detection of carer burden, a principal determinant of nursing home placement of PwD. Method: 60 PwD (MMSE >11 and Barthel Index>35) living at home with a full‐time carer were recruited in three pilot sites in the UK, Spain and Greece, and were randomly allocated to the telemedicine group (n=30) or the control group (n=30). Assessments of the PwDs' cognition, mood and quality of life, and the carers' burden, mood and quality of life were carried out at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Results: The results of the project are being analysed. It is predicted that increased communication and availability of information through telemedicine will enhance detection of change, management of the symptoms of PwD, and provide support for the carers relative to the control group. Discussion and conclusion: If positive, the outcomes can be a step forward towards better management of PwD living at home and avoid/delay institutionalisation, through frequent remote monitoring of their symptoms and supporting their carers.

AB: BACKGROUND: Audio/video‐mediated communication between patients and clinicians using videoconferencing over telecommunication networks is a key component of providing teletreatments in rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to (1) document the conditions of use, performance, and reliability of videoconferencing‐based communication in the context of in‐home teletreatment (TELE) following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and (2) assess from the perspective of the providers, the quality attributes of the technology used and its impact on clinical objectives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Descriptive embedded study in a randomized controlled trial using a sample of 97 post‐TKA patients, who received a total of 1,431 TELE sessions. Technical support use, service delivery reliability, performance, and use of network connection were assessed using self‐report data from a costing grid and automated logs captured from videoconferencing systems. Physical therapists assessed the quality and impact of video‐mediated communications after each TELE session on seven attributes. RESULTS: Installation of a new Internet connection was required in 75% of the participants and average technician's time to install test and uninstall technology (including travel time) was 308.4 min. The reliability of service delivery was 96.5% of planned sessions with 21% of TELE session requiring a reconnection during the session. Remote technical support was solicited in 43% of the sessions (interventions were less than 3‐min duration). Perceived technological impacts on video‐mediated communications were minimal with quality of the overall technical environment evaluated as good or acceptable in 96% of the sessions and clinical objectives reached almost completely or completely in 99% of the sessions. CONCLUSIONS: In‐home rehabilitation teletreatments can be delivered reliably but requires access to technical support for the initial setup and maintenance. Optimization of the processes of reliably connecting patients to the Internet, getting the telerehabilitation platform in the patient's home, installing, configuring, and testing will be needed to generalize this approach of service delivery.

AB: AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to compare the costs of home blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring (HBPM) with the costs of conventional office BP monitoring. In a randomized controlled trial, 105 hypertensive patients performed HBPM and 118 patients received usual care with conventional office BP monitoring during 6 months. Costs were quantified from the healthcare perspective. Non‐parametric simulations were performed to quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates and cost‐effectiveness acceptability curves were made. MAJOR FINDINGS: Systolic and diastolic daytime and night‐time ambulatory BP (ABP) were reduced in both groups. The uncertainty around the incremental cost effectiveness ratio point estimates was considerable for both systolic and diastolic ABP. For systolic ABP, the difference in cost effectiveness ratio between the two groups was 256 Danish kroner (DKK)/mmHg [95% uncertainty interval, UI ‐860 to 4544]. For diastolic ABP, the difference in cost effectiveness ratio between the two groups was 655 DKK/mmHg [95% UI ‐674 to 69315]. Medication and consultation costs were lowest in the intervention group, but were offset by the cost of the telemonitoring equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Cost‐effectiveness analysis showed that telemonitoring of home BP was more costly compared with usual monitoring of office BP. The cost‐effectiveness result is surrounded with considerable uncertainty.

AB: Objective: This one‐year study investigated whether the Manitoba Provincial Health Contact program for congestive heart failure (CHF) is a cost‐effective intervention relative to the standard treatment. Design: Individual patient‐level, randomized clinical trial of cost‐effective model using data from the Health Research Data Repository at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, University of Manitoba. Methods: A total of 179 patients aged 40 and over with a diagnosis of CHF levels II to IV were recruited from Winnipeg and Central Manitoba and randomized into three treatment groups: one receiving standard care, a second receiving Health Lines (HL) intervention and a third receiving Health Lines intervention plus in‐house monitoring (HLM). A cost‐effective‐ness study was conducted in which outcomes were measured in terms of QALYs derived from the SF‐36 and costs using 2005 Canadian dollars. Costs included intervention and healthcare utilization. Bootstrap‐resampled incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios were computed to take into account the uncertainty related to small sample size. Results: The total per‐patient mean costs (including intervention cost) were not significantly different between study groups. Both interventions (HL and HLM) cost less and are more effective than standard care, with HL able to produce an additional QALY relative to HLM for $2,975. The sensitivity analysis revealed that there is an 85.8% probability that HL is cost‐ effective if decision‐makers are willing to pay $50,000. Conclusion: Findings demonstrate that the HL intervention from the Manitoba Provincial Health Contact program for CHF is an optimal intervention strategy for CHF management compared to standard care and HLM.

AB: Objectives: To determine the cost‐effectiveness of using an online questionnaire (ePAQ‐PF) in combination with a telephone consultation compared to standard care. Methods: All women, aged > 18 years and referred to urogynaecology services in Sheffield were eligible. Women completed ePAQ‐PF online and then received a telephone consultation (intervention), or face‐to‐face consultation (standard care). Costs for ePAQ‐PF completion and consultation were derived in a microcosting study. Resource use data were collected at 6‐months follow‐up. The SF‐12 was administered at baseline and follow‐up. SF‐6D estimates were used to calculate quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs). Patient experience was measured by the Patient Experience Questionnaire and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire. Results: A total of 195 women were randomised. Consultation costs for the intervention group (31.75) were lower than for the control (72.17). The intervention group incurred greater direct costs and personal expenditure during follow‐up. However lower costs associated with productivity loss for the intervention group resulted in lower indirect costs per‐patient. Mean total costs per‐patient were 38.04 greater in the intervention group (1,139.86) than the control (1101.82). SF‐6D scores reduced slightly during follow‐up for the intervention group, and increased slightly for the control, resulting in QALY loss for the intervention group, and QALY gains for the control. Statistically significant gains in patient experience were identified for the intervention group, although in strict cost‐utility terms the intervention was dominated by the control. Incremental costs and QALYs resulted in a negative incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER). Conclusions: Although the intervention was not cost‐effective compared to the controls, there was a significant difference in an important aspect of the care process, which was not captured by the ICER. This highlights the importance of decision makers accounting for intervention effects that fall outside the conventional conceptualization of the QALY. Methods could be developed that allow non‐health effects, such as process utility, to be incorporated into the QALY.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To conduct an economic evaluation of intensive management by Indigenous health workers (IHWs) of Indigenous adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes in rural and remote north Queensland. DESIGN: Cost‐consequence analysis alongside a cluster randomised controlled trial of an intervention delivered between 1 March 2012 and 5 September 2013. SETTING: Twelve primary health care services in rural and remote north Queensland communities with predominantly Indigenous populations. PARTICIPANTS: Indigenous adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 69 mmol/mol) and at least one comorbidity (87 people in six IHW‐supported communities (IHW‐S); 106 in six usual care (UC) communities). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Per person cost of the intervention; differential changes in mean HbA1c levels, percentage with extremely poor HbA1c level control, quality of life, disease progression, and number of hospitalisations. RESULTS: The mean cost of the 18‐month intervention trial was $10 060 per person ($6706 per year). The intervention was associated with a non‐significantly greater reduction in mean HbA1c levels in the IHW‐S group (‐10.1 mmol/mol v ‐5.4 mmol/mol in the UC group; P = 0.17), a significant reduction in the proportion with extremely poor diabetes control (HbA1c ≥ 102 mmol/mol; P = 0.002), and a sub‐significant differential reduction in hospitalisation rates for type 2 diabetes as primary diagnosis (‐0.09 admissions/person/year; P = 0.06), with a net reduction in mean annual hospital costs of $646/person (P = 0.07). Quality of life utility scores declined in both groups (between‐group difference, P = 0.62). Rates of disease progression were high in both groups (between‐group difference, P = 0.73). CONCLUSION: Relative to the high cost of the intervention, the IHW‐S model as implemented is probably a poor investment. Incremental cost‐effectiveness might be improved by a higher caseload per IHW, a longer evaluation time frame, and improved service integration. Further approaches to improving chronic disease outcomes in this very unwell population need to be explored, including holistic approaches that address the complex psychosocial, pathophysiological and environmental problems of highly disadvantaged populations.

AB: BACKGROUND: Half of patients with hypertension have poor blood pressure (BP) control. Recent models for treating hypertension have integrated disease monitoring and telephone‐based interventions delivered in patients' homes. This study evaluated the costs of the Hypertension Intervention Nurse Telemedicine Study (HINTS), aimed to improve BP control in veterans. METHODS: Eligible veterans were randomized to either usual care or 1 of 3 telephone‐based intervention groups using home BP telemonitoring: (1) behavioral management, (2) medication management, or (3) combined. Intervention costs were derived from information collected during the trial. Direct medical costs (inpatient, outpatient, and outpatient pharmacy, including hypertension‐specific pharmacy) at 18 months by group were calculated using Veterans Affairs (VA) Decision Support System data. Bootstrapped CIs were computed to compare intervention and medical costs between intervention groups and usual care. RESULTS: Patients receiving behavior or medication management showed significant gains in BP control at 12 months; there were no differences in BP control at 18 months. In subgroup analysis, patients with poor baseline BP control receiving combined intervention significantly improved BP at 12 and 18 months. In overall and subgroup samples, average intervention costs were similar in the 3 study arms, and at 18 months, there were no statistically significant differences in direct VA medical costs or total VA costs between treatment arms and usual care. CONCLUSIONS: To optimize investment in telephone‐based home interventions such as the HINTS, it is important to identify groups of patients who are most likely to benefit from more intensive home BP management.

AB: BACKGROUND: An economic evaluation was performed alongside a randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN 74071417) investigating the cost‐effectiveness of nurse‐led telephone follow‐up instead of hospital visits, and of a short educational group programme (EGP) in the first year after breast cancer treatment. METHOD: This economic evaluation (n = 299) compared the one‐year costs and the effects of four follow‐up strategies: (1) hospital follow‐up; (2) nurse‐led telephone follow‐up; (3) hospital follow‐up plus EGP; and (4) nurse‐led telephone follow‐up plus EGP. Costs were measured using cost diaries and hospital registrations. Quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured using the EQ‐5D. Outcomes were expressed in incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost‐effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Hospital follow‐up plus EGP yielded most QALYs (0.776), but also incurred the highest mean annual costs (€4914). The ICER of this strategy versus the next best alternative, nurse‐led telephone follow‐up plus EGP (0.772 QALYs and €3971), amounted to €235.750/QALY. Hospital and telephone follow‐up without EGP both incurred higher costs and less QALYs than telephone follow‐up plus EGP and were judged inferior. Hospital follow‐up plus EGP was not considered cost‐effective, therefore, telephone follow‐up plus EGP was the preferred strategy. The probability of telephone follow‐up plus EGP being cost‐effective ranged from 49% to 62% for different QALY threshold values. Secondary and sensitivity analyses showed that results were robust. CONCLUSION: Nurse‐led telephone follow‐up plus EGP seems an appropriate and cost‐effective alternative to hospital follow‐up for breast cancer patients during their first year after treatment.

AB: Background: Pharmacist‐managed (team‐based) care for hypertension with home blood pressure monitoring support interventions has been widely studied and shown to be effective in improving rates of hypertension control and lowering blood pressure; however, few studies have evaluated the economic considerations related to bringing these programs into usual practice. Objective: To analyze the economic outcomes of the Home Blood Pressure Telemonitoring and Case Management to Control Hypertension (Hyperlink) study, a cluster randomized controlled trial which used home blood pressure telemonitoring and pharmacist case management to achieve better blood pressure control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension was conducted. Methods: A prospective analysis compared differences in medical costs and encounters in the Hyperlink telemonitoring intervention and usual care groups in the 12 months pre‐ and postenrollment using medical and pharmacy insurance claims from a health care sector perspective. Generalized estimating equation models were used to estimate differences between the groups over time. These results, combined with previously published prospective study results on intervention costs and blood pressure outcomes, were used to estimate cost‐effectiveness measures for blood pressure control and reduction. Findings: Total medical costs in the intervention group were lower compared with the usual care group by an average of $281 per person, but this difference was not statistically significant. Clinic‐based office visit, radiology, pharmacy and hospital costs were also nonsignificantly lower in the intervention group. Statistically significant differences were found in lipid‐related laboratory costs (higher) and in hypertension‐related (higher) and lipid‐related (lower) pharmacy costs. Patterns in medical costs were similar for medical encounters. On average, the intervention cost $7337 per person achieving hypertension control and $139 or $265 per mm Hg reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, respectively. Conclusions: Home blood pressure monitoring and pharmacist case management to improve hypertension care can be implemented without increasing, and potentially reducing, overall medical care costs.

AB: Objectives: Despite the growing evidence supporting Home‐based telebehavioral health (HBTBH) in improving mental health, there has not been an economic analysis comparing it to traditional In‐person (IP) setting. The National Center for Telehealth and Technology recently completed a randomized controlled trial comparing the safety and efficacy of HBTBH among U.S. military personnel and Veterans with depression. We performed a trial‐based economic analysis comparing HBTBH and IP care for depression. Methods: We performed a cost‐minimization analysis on 121 patients with depression to assess the economic impact of HBTBH versus IP behavioral health care from the payer perspective (Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs) at 3 months. Sample population included US service members and veterans with a diagnosis of depression from Joint Base Lewis‐ McChord (Washington state) and veterans were enrolled from the VA Health Care System (Portland, Oregon). We also performed a scenario analysis assuming that all patients had access to personal video conferencing technology. One‐way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model assumptions. Results: In the base‐case analysis the total direct cost of HBTBH care was higher than IP care ($68,483 versus $21,561). This translates to an $813 increase per patient. Assuming that patients personally owned computers could be used, HBTBH care was less costly compared to IP care ($18,242 versus $21,561). In one‐way sensitivity analyses, the proportion of patients using personal computers was a major driver of direct costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis did not differ substantially from the base‐case results. Conclusions: Total direct cost of HBTBH care was sensitive to whether patients were able to utilize their personally owned technology. Avoiding the use of government provided computers substantially improves the cost of HBTBH. Health care policies centered on implementation of HBTBH care may benefit from evaluation of technology restrictions among beneficiaries.

AB: Background: Despite recent developments in surgical education, obstacles including inadequate budget, limited human resources, and a scarcity of time have limited its widespread adoption. To provide systematic training for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair, we had previously developed and validated a checklist to evaluate the recorded performance of transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair. We had also developed an educational system that included didactic materials based on the TAPP checklist and incorporated remote evaluation and feedback system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the educational impact of the TAPP education system on novice surgeons. Methods: Residents and surgeons from participating hospitals, who had performed 0 or 1 TAPP procedure, were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG), who trained using this new educational tool, and the control group (CG), who trained using the conventional system. Their surgical videos were rated by blinded raters. All participants performed their first case prior to randomization. The primary outcome was improvement of TAPP checklist score from the first to the third case. Results: Eighteen participants from 9 institutes were recruited for this study. Seven participants in the IG and 5 participants in the CG were included in the final analysis. The participants in the IG demonstrated significant improvement in their TAPP performance (p = 0.044) from their first case to their third case, whereas their counterparts in the CG failed to make any significant progress during the same period (p = 0.581). Conclusion: The new TAPP educational system was effective in improving the TAPP performance of novice surgeons.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs and cost effectiveness of telehealth in addition to standard support and treatment, compared with standard support and treatment. DESIGN: Economic evaluation nested in a pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Community based telehealth intervention in three local authority areas in England. PARTICIPANTS: 3230 people with a long term condition (heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or diabetes) were recruited into the Whole Systems Demonstrator telehealth trial between May 2008 and December 2009. Of participants taking part in the Whole Systems Demonstrator telehealth questionnaire study examining acceptability, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness, 845 were randomised to telehealth and 728 to usual care. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention participants received a package of telehealth equipment and monitoring services for 12 months, in addition to the standard health and social care services available in their area. Controls received usual health and social care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary outcome for the cost effectiveness analysis was incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: We undertook net benefit analyses of costs and outcomes for 965 patients (534 receiving telehealth; 431 usual care). The adjusted mean difference in QALY gain between groups at 12 months was 0.012. Total health and social care costs (including direct costs of the intervention) for the three months before 12 month interview were £1390 (€1610; $2150) and £1596 for the usual care and telehealth groups, respectively. Cost effectiveness acceptability curves were generated to examine decision uncertainty in the analysis surrounding the value of the cost effectiveness threshold. The incremental cost per QALY of telehealth when added to usual care was £92 000. With this amount, the probability of cost effectiveness was low (11% at willingness to pay threshold of £30 000; >50% only if the threshold exceeded about £90 000). In sensitivity analyses, telehealth costs remained slightly (non‐significantly) higher than usual care costs, even after assuming that equipment prices fell by 80% or telehealth services operated at maximum capacity. However, the most optimistic scenario (combining reduced equipment prices with maximum operating capacity) eliminated this group difference (cost effectiveness ratio £12 000 per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: The QALY gain by patients using telehealth in addition to usual care was similar to that by patients receiving usual care only, and total costs associated with the telehealth intervention were higher. Telehealth does not seem to be a cost effective addition to standard support and treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN43002091.

AB: Management of oral anti‐coagulation therapy (OAT) in a hospital based setting is an unnecessary burden on tertiary care services. Alternative flexible systems of anti‐coagulation management are available. One option is pharmacist led patient self‐testing (PST) of international normalised ratio (INR) levels. PST has demonstrated improvements in anticoagulation control, but its cost‐effectiveness is inconclusive. The aim of this study is to conduct a cost‐effectiveness evaluation of an automated direct‐to‐patient expert system, enabling remote and effective management of patients on OAT. We conducted an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial investigating a pharmacist led PST method. Full results of clinical trial are published elsewhere [1]. Trial was conducted in an Irish university teaching hospital. Long term anticoagulation patients (n = 162), were recruited to a 6‐month cross over study between PST and routine care in a hospital based anti‐coagulation clinic. Costs were informed by individual patient resource use, published salary scales, data from suppliers of expert systems and in‐house hospital data. The outcome measure of this economic evaluation was the incremental cost of patient management over a 6‐month period. Economic evaluation was from the healthcare payer perspective. Ethical approval was obtained from all responsible committees. On a per patient basis over a 6‐month period, PST resulted in an incremental cost of €59.08 in comparison with routine care. Patients achieved a significantly higher time in therapeutic range (TTR) during the PST arm in comparison with routine care. Overall cost of managing a patient through pharmacist supervised PST for a 6‐month period is €226.45. Additional analysis of strategies from a societal perspective indicated that PST was the dominant strategy. PST is marginally more expensive in comparison with centralised laboratory testing. However, the associated increase in INR control for a modest increase in expenditure provides further evidence that optimally managed warfarin therapy remains a successful strategy for anticoagulation management. TTR levels demonstrated in the intervention arm of the study are associated with significantly improved patient outcomes in terms of death, major bleeding and stroke[2]. (Table Presented).

AB: OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost‐effectiveness of an internet‐based, nurse‐led vascular risk factor management programme in addition to usual care compared with usual care alone in patients with a clinical manifestation of a vascular disease. DESIGN: Cost‐effectiveness analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial (the Internet‐based vascular Risk factor Intervention and Self‐management (IRIS) study). SETTING: Multicentre trial in a secondary and tertiary healthcare setting. PARTICIPANTS: 330 patients with a recent clinical manifestation of atherosclerosis in the coronary, cerebral, or peripheral arteries and with ≥2 treatable vascular risk factors not at goal. INTERVENTION: The intervention consisted of a personalised website with an overview and actual status of patients' vascular risk factors, and mail communication with a nurse practitioner via the website for 12 months. The intervention combined self‐management support, monitoring of disease control and pharmacotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Societal costs, quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) and incremental cost‐effectiveness. RESULTS: Patients experienced equal health benefits, that is, 0.86 vs 0.85 QALY (intervention vs usual care) at 1 year. Adjusting for baseline differences, the incremental QALY difference was ‐0.014 (95% CI ‐0.034 to 0.007). The intervention was associated with lower total costs (€4859 vs €5078, difference €219, 95% CI ‐€2301 to €1825). The probability that the intervention is cost‐effective at a threshold value of €20,000/QALY, is 65%. At mean annual cost of €220 per patient, the intervention is relatively cheap. CONCLUSIONS: An internet‐based, nurse‐led intervention in addition to usual care to improve vascular risk factors in patients with a clinical manifestation of a vascular disease does not result in a QALY gain at 1 year, but has a small effect on vascular risk factors and is associated with lower costs.

AB: BACKGROUND: Most patients with chest pain have nothing wrong with their cardiac function. Psychological forms of treatment for this condition are more likely to be successful than others. METHODS/DESIGN: A two‐arm parallel controlled randomized trial of standard care versus a modified form of cognitive behaviour therapy for chest pain (CBT‐CP) in patients who have attended emergency hospital services. Inclusion criteria include (i) emergency attendance more than once in the previous year with chest pain when no physical pathology has been found, (ii) aged between 16 and 75, (iii) signed consent to take part in the study. Exclusion criteria are (i) under current psychiatric care, (ii) those who have had new psychotropic drugs prescribed within the last two months, (iii) are receiving or about to receive a formal psychological treatment. Those satisfying these criteria will be randomized to 4‐10 sessions of CBT‐CP or to continue with standard care. Participants are randomized using a remote web‐based system using permuted stacked blocks stratified by study centre. Assessment is carried out at baseline by researchers subsequently masked to allocation and at 6 months and 1 year after randomization. The primary outcome is the Health Anxiety Inventory score at 6 months, and secondary outcomes are generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms, the Lucock Health Anxiety Questionnaire adapted for chest pain, visual analogue scales for chest pain and discomfort (Inskip Scale), the Schedule for Evaluating Persistent Symptoms (SEPS), health related quality of life, social functioning and medical resource usage. Intention to treat analyses will be carried out with clinical and functioning data, and a cost‐utility analysis will compare differences in total costs and differences in quality of life using QALYs derived from the EQ‐5D. The data will also be linked to another parallel study in New Zealand where 126 patients with the same inclusion criteria have been treated in a similar trial; the form of analysis of the combined data has yet to be determined. DISCUSSION: The morbidity and costs of non‐cardiac chest pain are substantial and if a simple psychological treatment given by health professionals working in medical departments is beneficial it should prove to be of great value. Combining data with a similar study in New Zealand is an additional asset. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN14711101 (registered 05/03/2015).

AB: Objectives: To preliminary assess the economic impact of CareToy, the innovative technological smart modular system for early intervention (EI) in preterm infants at risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. The incidence of preterm births (before than 37 weeks of gestational age) has increased and survival rates in very preterm infants have improved over the past two decades. EI has been used in the clinical setting with the aim of improving the overall outcome for preterm infants and the CareToy project ‐ funded by the European Commission within the FP7 ‐ has developed and validated the CareToy system as a new technological tool for an intensive, individualized, home‐based and family‐centred EI in preterm infants. Methods: A decision tree model was developed in order to assess the likely cost‐effectiveness of the innovative tele‐rehabilitation system in comparison with the Standard of Care (SoC) to treat preterm infants at risk from a neurodevelopmental perspective. In addition to the data collected by the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) study within the CareToy project, a structured search was carried out to identify evidence of relevant facts concerning clinical outcomes, costs and effectiveness in order to populate the entire model. It should be stressed that a small amount of literature evidence on current treatments in the EI field was to date available. Results: The decision model provided the tools to measure the innovation of the CareToy system in health economic terms. Conclusions: An advantageous collaboration among technology developers, physicians and assessors of innovations is essential for improving the efficiency of taking innovative biomedical technologies through the Early Health Technology Assessment (EHTA) process and into adoption in the healthcare practice.

AB: Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of tailored print communication (TPC), telephone motivational interviewing (TMI), a combination of the two, and no intervention on two outcomes in adults aged 45 to 70, half of them having hypertension: increasing the number of public health guidelines met for three behaviors (physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption), and impact on quality adjusted life years (QALYs).Methods: Participants (n = 1,629) from 23 Dutch general practices were randomized into one of four groups, which received 4 TPCs, 4 TMIs, 2 of each (combined), or no intervention (control), respectively. The self‐reported outcomes, measured at baseline and 73 weeks follow‐up (7 months after the last intervention component), were difference in total number of guidelines met at follow‐up compared to baseline, and number of QALYs experienced over 73 weeks. The costs of implementing the intervention were estimated using a bottom‐up approach.Results: At 73 weeks follow‐up participants showed increased adherence with 0.62 (TPC), 0.40 (TMI), 0.50 (combined), and 0.26 (control) guidelines compared to baseline, and experienced 1.09, 1.08, 1.08, and 1.07 QALYs, respectively. The costs for the control group were considered to be zero. TMI was more expensive (€107 per person) than both the combined intervention (€80) and TPC (€57). The control condition was most cost‐effective for lower ceiling ratios, while TPC had the highest probability of being most cost‐effective for higher ceiling ratios (more than €160 per additional guideline met, and €2,851 for each individual QALY).Conclusions: For low society's willingness to pay, the control group was most cost‐effective for the number of QALYs experienced over 73 weeks. This also applied to the increase in the number of guidelines met at lower ceiling ratios, whereas at higher ceiling ratios, TPC had a higher probability of being more cost‐effective than the TMI, combined or control conditions. This also seemed to apply for QALYs experienced over 73 weeks. More research is needed on the long‐term efficacy of both TPC and TMI, as well as on how to increase their cost‐effectiveness. © 2010 van Keulen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Overall cost of managing a patient through pharmacist supervised PST for a 6 month period is € 226.45. Additional analysis of strategies from a societal perspective indicated that PST was the dominant strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist led patient self‐testing is a viable method of management. It provides significant increases in anti‐coagulation control for a minimal increase in cost.

AB: INTERVENTION: The Embedding Package is implemented in each practice for a six month period during the feasibility study. An integrated ethnographic element, using observation and semi‐structure interviews, are conducted to provide detailed contextually‐sensitive data about the process of implementation, sustainability of the change and the ‘fit’ of the Embedding Package within routine practice. The Embedding Package comprises of four key components which have been collated in to an online resource: 1. A clear marketing strategy 2. User friendly and effective referral pathway 3. New/amended roles including a local clinical champion and an ‘Embedder’ 4. Toolkit of resources (for patients, healthcare professionals and other key stakeholders Packages of support and resources, resources developed in an earlier part of our research project that deals with a wide variety of needs, from training GPs and nurses in how to explain the benefits of diabetes education to improving the way that information about diabetes education is made available in local communities. A skilled person described as an ‘Embedder’ is provided to centres to support practices with ideas and skills. Information from patients with type 2 diabetes and healthcare staff is collected through a variety of different methods, including a patient questionnaire, interviews and observations and pseudonymised electronic patient data. Eligible patient participants are asked to complete a questionnaire, take part in observations and interviews relating to diabetes structured education and provide consent to access medical information. The information gathered is used to to develop the resources ready for a larger scientific trial in 80 more GP practices around the UK in 2018.

AB: OBJECTIVE: A previous multisite, randomized, controlled trial of peer support compared with usual care for prevention of postpartum depression demonstrated a reduction in depression symptoms at 12 weeks postbirth. Our objective was to determine the cost‐effectiveness of this intervention. STUDY DESIGN: Prospectively planned economic evaluation alongside the clinical trial to determine the cost per case of postpartum depression averted, using individual patient data (n = 610) and societal perspective. All costs were expressed in 2011 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: The mean cost per woman was $4,497 in the peer support group and $3,380 in the usual care group (difference of $1,117, p < 0.0001). There was a 95% probability that the program would cost less than $20,196 per case of postpartum depression averted. CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a volunteer‐based program, it results in a net cost to the health care system and society. However, this cost is within the range for other accepted interventions for this population.

AB: Background: Although results of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) are beneficial, many eligible patients do not participate in CR, and the beneficial effects of CR are often not maintained over time. Home‐based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve participation rates and enhance long‐term effectiveness. However, evidence on its relative cost‐effectiveness compared to centre‐based CR is scarce. Methods: We randomized 90 low to moderate risk patients entering CR to 3 months of either home‐based training (HB) or centre‐based training (CB). We conducted an economic evaluation by comparing healthcare and non‐healthcare costs of both groups after one year, and a cost‐utility analysis based on quality‐adjusted‐life‐years (QALYs). Results: The QALYs calculated for both groups were similar (CB: 0.78±0.08, HB: 0.77±0.13, p=0.73). The costs for the CR programmes were similar between groups (CB: E336±68, HB: E314±68, p=0.13). Total healthcare costs for the HB group were E437 less than for the CB group, and total non‐healthcare costs were E2,723 less for the HB group. However, these differences were not significant (p=0.39 and p=0.12 respectively). From a societal perspective, a non‐significant difference of E3,160 per patient in favour of home‐based CR was found (p=0.09) and the probability that it was more cost‐effective varied between 97% and 75% (willingness‐to‐pay of E0 and E100,000 per QALY respectively). Discussion: Although we found no statistically significant differences in QALYs and costs between home‐based CR and centre‐based CR, almost all components in the economic evaluation were favourable for the home‐based CR. For the accepted willingness‐to‐pay per QALY (€20,000‐40,000), we conclude that home‐based CR training appears to be more cost‐effective than centre‐based CR. [TABLE PRESENTED].

DOI: 10.1186/1471-2288-11-126
AB: BACKGROUND: Surveys of doctors are an important data collection method in health services research. Ways to improve response rates, minimise survey response bias and item non‐response, within a given budget, have not previously been addressed in the same study. The aim of this paper is to compare the effects and costs of three different modes of survey administration in a national survey of doctors. METHODS: A stratified random sample of 4.9% (2,702/54,160) of doctors undertaking clinical practice was drawn from a national directory of all doctors in Australia. Stratification was by four doctor types: general practitioners, specialists, specialists‐in‐training, and hospital non‐specialists, and by six rural/remote categories. A three‐arm parallel trial design with equal randomisation across arms was used. Doctors were randomly allocated to: online questionnaire (902); simultaneous mixed mode (a paper questionnaire and login details sent together) (900); or, sequential mixed mode (online followed by a paper questionnaire with the reminder) (900). Analysis was by intention to treat, as within each primary mode, doctors could choose either paper or online. Primary outcome measures were response rate, survey response bias, item non‐response, and cost. RESULTS: The online mode had a response rate 12.95%, followed by the simultaneous mixed mode with 19.7%, and the sequential mixed mode with 20.7%. After adjusting for observed differences between the groups, the online mode had a 7 percentage point lower response rate compared to the simultaneous mixed mode, and a 7.7 percentage point lower response rate compared to sequential mixed mode. The difference in response rate between the sequential and simultaneous modes was not statistically significant. Both mixed modes showed evidence of response bias, whilst the characteristics of online respondents were similar to the population. However, the online mode had a higher rate of item non‐response compared to both mixed modes. The total cost of the online survey was 38% lower than simultaneous mixed mode and 22% lower than sequential mixed mode. The cost of the sequential mixed mode was 14% lower than simultaneous mixed mode. Compared to the online mode, the sequential mixed mode was the most cost‐effective, although exhibiting some evidence of response bias. CONCLUSIONS: Decisions on which survey mode to use depend on response rates, response bias, item non‐response and costs. The sequential mixed mode appears to be the most cost‐effective mode of survey administration for surveys of the population of doctors, if one is prepared to accept a degree of response bias. Online surveys are not yet suitable to be used exclusively for surveys of the doctor population.

AB: Background: Evidence for the use of telephone consultation in childhood inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is lacking. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost consequences of telephone consultation compared with the usual out‐patient face‐to‐face consultation for young people with IBD. Methods: We conducted a randomised‐controlled trial in Manchester, UK, between July 12, 2010 and June 30, 2013. Young people (aged 8‐16. years) with IBD were randomized to receive telephone consultation or face‐to‐face consultation for 24. months. The primary outcome measure was the paediatric IBD‐specific IMPACT quality of life (QOL) score at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures included patient satisfaction with consultations, disease course, anthropometric measures, proportion of consultations attended, duration of consultations, and costs to the UK National Health Service (NHS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02319798. Findings: Eighty six patients were randomised to receive either telephone consultation (n = 44) or face‐to‐face consultation (n = 42). Baseline characteristics of the two groups were well balanced. At 12 months, there was no evidence of difference in QOL scores (estimated treatment effect in favour of the telephone consultation group was 5.7 points, 95% CI ‐ 2.9 to 14.3; p = 0.19). Mean consultation times were 9.8. min (IQR 8 to 12.3) for telephone consultation, and 14.3. min (11.6 to 17.0) for face‐to‐face consultation with an estimated reduction (95% CI) of 4.3 (2.8 to 5.7) min in consultation times (p < 0.001). Telephone consultation had a mean cost of UK35.41 per patient consultation compared with 51.12 for face‐face consultation, difference 15.71 (95% CI 11.8‐19.6; P. < 0.001). Interpretation: We found no suggestion of inferiority of telephone consultation compared with face‐to‐face consultation with regard to improvements in QOL scores, and telephone consultation reduced consultation time and NHS costs. Telephone consultation is a cost‐effective alternative to face‐to‐face consultation for the routine outpatient follow‐up of children and adolescents with IBD.

AB: PURPOSE: BRCA1/2 counseling and mutation testing is recommended for high‐risk women, but geographic barriers exist, and no data on the costs and yields of diverse delivery approaches are available. METHODS: We performed an economic evaluation with a randomized clinical trial comparing telephone versus in‐person counseling at 14 locations (nine geographically remote). Costs included fixed overhead, variable staff, and patient time costs; research costs were excluded. Outcomes included average per‐person costs for pretest counseling; mutations detected; and overall counseling, testing, and disclosure. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of uncertainty. RESULTS: In‐person counseling was more costly per person counseled than was telephone counseling ($270 [range, $180 to $400] v $120 [range, $80 to $200], respectively). Counselors averaged 285 miles round‐trip to deliver in‐person counseling to the participants (three participants per session). There were no differences by arm in mutation detection rates (approximately 10%); therefore, telephone counseling was less costly per positive mutation detected than was in‐person counseling ($37,160 [range, $36,080 to$38,920] v $40,330 [range, $38,010 to $43,870]). In‐person counseling would only be less costly than telephone counseling if the most favorable assumptions were applied to in personc ounseling and the least favorable assumptions were applied to telephone counseling. CONCLUSION: In geographically underserved areas, telephone counseling is less costly than in‐person counseling.

AB: Background: Child maltreatment is a significant public health problem. Group Family Nurse Partnership (gFNP) is a new intervention for young, expectant mothers implemented successfully in pilot studies. This study was designed to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of gFNP in reducing risk factors for maltreatment with a potentially vulnerable population. Methods: A multi‐site, randomized controlled, parallel‐arm trial and prospective economic evaluation was conducted, with allocation via remote randomization (minimization by site, maternal age group) to gFNP or usual care. Participants were expectant mothers aged below 20 years with at least one live birth, or aged 20‐24 years with no live births and with low educational qualifications. Data from maternal interviews at baseline and when infants were 2, 6 and 12 months, and video‐recording at 12 months, were collected by researchers blind to allocation. Cost information came from weekly logs completed by gFNP family nurses and other service delivery data reported by participants. Primary outcomes measured at 12 months were parenting attitudes (Adult‐Adolescent Parenting Index, AAPI‐2) and maternal sensitivity (CARE Index). The economic evaluation was conducted from a UK NHS and personal social services perspective with cost‐effectiveness expressed in terms of incremental cost per quality‐adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The main analyses were intention‐to‐treat with additional complier average causal effects (CACE) analyses. Results: Between August 2013 and September 2014, 492 names of potential participants were received of whom 319 were eligible and 166 agreed to take part, 99 randomly assigned to receive gFNP and 67 to usual care. There were no between‐arm differences in AAPI‐2 total (7 . 5/10 in both, SE 0.1), difference adjusted for baseline, site and maternal age group 0 . 06 (95% CI ‐ 0 . 15 to 0 . 28, p = 0 . 59) or CARE Index (intervention 4 . 0 (SE 0 . 3); control 4 . 7 (SE 0 . 4); difference adjusted for site and maternal age group ‐ 0 . 68 (95% CI ‐ 1 . 62 to 0 . 16, p = 0 . 25) scores. The probability that gFNP is cost‐effective based on the QALY measure did not exceed 3%. Conclusions: The trial did not support gFNP as a means of reducing the risk of child maltreatment in this population but slow recruitment adversely affected group size and consequently delivery of the intervention.

AB: Background: The older population is increasing with an expected increase in hospital admissions and associated cost. Out‐of‐hospital‐treatment in the form of a hospital at home (HH) is a potential alternative, but the evidence is limited. This study aimed to test feasibility of performing a full trial of HH in acutely ill older patients. Methods: We conducted a feasibility study in acutely ill patients ≥65 years admitted to the Emergency Department. Patients were included based on five main criteria: General eligibility, medical status, treatment requirement, cognition, and willingness to participate. Patients were transferred home within 36 hours with subsequent daily visits from healthcare professionals. Telemedicine technologies were used to increase the safety of the patients. Results: Of 601 patients screened (median age=80 years, 56% female) only 7 (1%) were eligible and willing to participate. Main reasons for not participating were poor status of health and scepti‐cism towards the home admission. Patients admitted at home felt safe and found several positive aspects. Health‐care professionals found that the HH intervention gave the opportunity to create a patient‐centred treatment. The intervention was not successfully integrated because of the few cases resulting in unfamiliarity with the setup. Economic evaluation found that HH had no economic advantages over usual in‐hospital admission. Conclusion: HH for older acute medical patients was not feasible in the design that we tested. The severity and complexity of patients, together with the existing competences of the municipality health‐care staff, does not justify proceeding to a large randomised controlled trial with this set up.

AB: IVIG is of proven efficacy in chronic inflammatory neuropathies, including CIDP and MMN. Home‐based IVIG treatment offers potential benefits to patients in terms of quality of life, avoiding travelling time and costs. It also results in improved availability of hospital resources for treatment of patients with other neurological conditions. HOME LINK is a telemedicine system developed to provide an innovative solution for the management of patients treated with IVIg at home. It ensures a permanent monitoring of the patients using communicating medical devices and link together all actors of the management of Home‐based IVIG treated patients including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and home‐care companies. Home Link provides a medicalized teleassistance platform capable of handling any adverse event occurring during and/or after the treatment delivery. A team of doctors, caregivers, engineers and technicians are working together 24/7 to provide a secure and confidential medical monitoring service. A medico‐economic study will evaluate the efficiency (cost‐effectiveness) of the telemedicine system compared with traditional care. The method is the stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) design mainly used for evaluating interventions during routine implementation. In this approach, clusters, for example, geographical areas, and hospitals, are identified to take part in a cluster randomized trial and, before the trial begins, are randomly allocated a time when they are given the intervention. All the groups will receive the intervention, but the time when they receive this is randomly ordered. The stepped wedge CRCT design may require fewer clusters than a parallel CRCT design. It maximizes statistical power because the intervention effect is estimated not only by between‐cluster comparisons but also by within‐cluster comparisons. The stepped wedge CRCT design offers an alternative to other designs that can be applied in routine practice for intervention evaluation.

YR: 2018
KY: Lung Diseases; Lung Diseases, Obstructive; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive
AB: This study is an open‐label, prospective, single‐centred, randomized control trial, containing both a quantitative and a qualitative component and using a mixed methods design, to evaluate the impact of Cloud Dx, a device that can help patients monitor and manage Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at their home, on COPD and whether it improves patients' COPD symptoms, ability to manage COPD, and quality of life. COPD is a pervasive disease that is estimated to affect 2.6 million Canadians (17%) aged 35 to 79 have COPD costing the healthcare system in Canada $1.5 billion annually. Ontarians living with COPD are frequent users of the health care system and account for 24% of hospital admissions and 24% of emergency department (ED) visits and COPD is responsible for the highest percentage (18.8%) of 30‐day readmissions to ED in the province. A recent Cochrane review and meta‐analysis concluded that remote monitoring has shown promise in reducing acute care utilization and reducing the number of exacerbations in COPD patients. While many studies have examined the effects of remote‐monitoring, few studies have looked at how self‐monitoring without clinical oversight affects patients' self‐management skills and quality of life. Our goal is to compare a group of patients that are in both self‐ and remote‐monitoring to a group of patients that are only in a self‐monitoring program and compare each relative to a standard care group. The Cochrane review and meta‐analysis concluded that remote monitoring has shown promise in reducing acute care utilization and reducing the number of exacerbations in COPD patients. The technology used in this study is the Cloud Dx Connect Health Kit which will be used as a tool for self‐monitoring and asynchronous remote monitoring. It consists of a custom Tablet computer, Pulsewave® wrist cuff monitor, Oximeter, Scale and Therometer. Participants will use the kit to record daily their physiological and symptom readings. This study will take place at Markham‐Stoufville hospital with most patients being recruited from the Outpatient COPD Clinic (Respiratory Health‐COPD Clinic) and will include patients who have a clinical diagnosis of COPD that has been diagnosed by their respirologist as per clinical guidelines. Recruitment will be on‐going until 123 patients have been recruited for the intervention phase. Once enrolled, participants will be randomized into one of three arms: 1. Self‐Management group: Participants in this group will receive the Cloud Dx kit at the start of the study and will continue using it for 6 months. They will be recording their vitals and symptoms with the Cloud DX platform everyday and will be provided with an action‐plan that instructs them on what to do in response to their readings. 2. Room‐Monitoring group: Participants in this group will receive the Cloud Dx kit at the start of the study and will continue using it for 6 months. They will be recording their vitals and symptoms with the Cloud DX platform everyday and will be provided with an action‐plan that instructs them on what to do in response to their readings. In addition, a respiratory therapist (RT) will be monitoring asynchronously their vitals and contacting them when their vitals exceed pre‐determined thresholds. The RT will also check on patients once a week irrespective of the value of the vitals. 3. Standard of care group: Participants will not be provided with a technology or an action plan (as the action plan is based on vitals and symptoms). Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed through a series of questionnaires at 3 time‐points by all participants: at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.In addition, participants will also complete a demographic questionnaire at the initial visit. Participants who expressed interest during their consent process for the quantitative component described above will be invited to complete a qualitative interview. This qualitative process evaluation will occur alongside the quantitative component and will include 5 participants from the remote‐monitoring group and 5 participants from the self‐monitoring group. Healthcare providers involved in the care of participants will also be approached for participation in this evaluation process as well as upon study completion and will ideally include a sample of 5 providers from the remote‐monitoring group and 5 providers from the self‐monitoring group.

AB: Depression is one of the most common mental disorders and will become one of the leading causes of disability in the world. Internet‐based CBT programs for depression have been classified as "well established" following the American Psychological Association criteria for empirically supported treatments. The aim of this study is to analyze the cost effectiveness at 12‐month follow‐up of the Internet‐based CBT program "Smiling is fun" with (LITG) and without psychotherapist support (TSG) compared to usual care. The perspective used in our analysis is societal. A sample of 296 depressed patients (mean age of 43.04 years; 76% female; BDI‐II mean score = 22.37) from primary care services in four Spanish regions were randomized in the RCT. The complete case and intention‐to‐treat (ITT) perspectives were used for the analyses. The results demonstrated that both Internet‐based CBT interventions exhibited cost utility and cost effectiveness compared with a control group. The complete case analyses revealed an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €‐169.50 and an incremental cost‐utility ratio (ICUR) of €‐11389.66 for the TSG group and an ICER of €‐104.63 and an ICUR of €‐6380.86 for the LITG group. The ITT analyses found an ICER of €‐98.37 and an ICUR of €‐5160.40 for the TSG group and an ICER of €‐9.91 and an ICUR of €496.72 for the LITG group. In summary, the results of this study indicate that the two Internet‐based CBT interventions are appropriate from both economic and clinical perspectives for depressed patients in the Spanish primary care system. These interventions not only help patients to improve clinically but also generate societal savings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov NCT01611818.

TI: The Efficacy of Specialist Collaboration and Mobile Screening for Improving the Management of Diabetes
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct01275040
YR: 2010
KY: Diabetes Mellitus
AB: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a major metabolic disease that is characterised by a reduced or impaired capability of the body to regulate its blood glucose levels. The disease is now reaching pandemic levels. The global prevalence for DM (across all age groups) was estimated to be 2,8% in 2000, and it will rise to 4,4% by 2030. In real numbers this implies from 171 million people to 366 million people will be affected globally. This rise will certainly have an impact of the health care system of many countries. Most of the DM patients will be managed at primary health care level. It has become clear that the difficulties in achieving a satisfactory level of health care delivery for DM patients are not related to the availability of knowledge of the disease, nor the best diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, but rather to system and organisational problems. Many of the complications of diabetes are potentially preventable or can be minimized if earlier action has been taken. The chronic nature of the disease and the need for the empowerment of the patient and the health workers in understanding the disease to ensure optimal glucose control makes DM an ideal disease to test new models of health care delivery which can include patient empowerment, health worker empowerment and the use of telemedicine and E‐Health . It is believed that the current primary health care approach is not allowing for sufficient time and personnel to provide patients with optimal care and to screen for diabetic complications. Currently only the blood pressure and random blood glucose measures are taken at Primary Health Care (PHC) facilities, even though the national policy for the management of diabetes prescribes the monitoring of complications at least once a year. This study investigates the benefits of a comprehensive mobile screening effort to identify and to improve the early detection of diabetes‐related complications. With the expected improvement in disease management and patient specific outcomes, this study will contribute to policy changes for diabetes management at primary health care level. This study differs from other studies that evaluated complications in isolation. It aims to evaluate the efficacy of a complex intervention that provides an interface for Specialist from Family Medicine and Internal Medicine to collaborate and includes a mobile comprehensive complication screening service. The study also provides opportunity for training of clinic staff as well exposure and training of Clinical Associates regarding diabetes care and complication screening and management. It is envisaged that the structured screening and review programme will provide evidence for ways to ensure future collaboration enhancing diabetes patient outcomes. The aim of this pragmatic study is to investigate the effectiveness of a mobile complication screening team and expert review and collaboration between tertiary care specialist and primary care generalist for improving optimal, comprehensive diabetic care at the primary health care level in one of the districts in South Africa, using a cluster randomized control design. STUDY DESIGN A two arm Pragmatic Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial (C‐RCT) with an active arm consisting of a mobile screening service and a control arm which receives standard care. 2. A cross sectional descriptive study of patients not enrolled in the trial but attending the screening visit (in the clinics known as the intervention clinics). SETTING Primary Health Care (PHC) Clinics that are situated in the Tshwane Health District, Gauteng Province, South Africa. PATIENT/RESEARCH OBJECT SELECTION All patients with type 2 DM and type 1 DM with minimum of five years duration will be considered for both the intervention and the comparison arm. Only patients over the age of 18 years will be enrolled into the study (Children with diabetes are not managed at Primary Care level). The first 50 patients meeting selection criteria will be enrolled in the study (maximum 5 type 1 patients per clinic). The rest of the diabetics at the clinic will also be invited onto the mobile clinic for the purposes of screening for complications, but their data will be kept separate from the study population's data. It will also be analysed separately. The study budget only allows for laboratory testing of the 600 study participants. Sample Size: Prior to randomization all eligible clinics will be stratified according to the following criteria and intervention and control clinics will be matched accordingly: 1. Type of clinic (primary care clinic or health care centre) 2. Clinic with or without full time physician in attendance 3. Number of patients with diabetes seen in a month ( <>200 per month) The investigators have no reason to believe that quality of care indicators or HbA1c will differ between clinics. A restricted randomization procedure using a random number table will be carried out by an independent researcher to ensure equal numbers of clinics in each group. The sample size is based on a cluster sampling estimate done in STATA Intercooled Version 10. Primary outcome 1: Lowering of HbA1c from 9.5% to 8.5% (thus 1% reduction) using ANCOVA adjusting for baseline HbA1c; SD=2.4 &r=0.65,ICC=0.05 for continuous variable; Alpha‐value= 0.05 and Power of 90% = 198 patients in each arm in 12 clusters are required. Primary outcome 2: DM Complications Detection Proportion improvement from 10% to at least 30% (thus 20% improvement); ICC=0.02 for binary variable; Alpha=0.05 and power=90% giving an estimated sample size of 275 in each arm. In order to ensure adequate randomization and compensate for possible loss to follow up 300 patients will be evaluated in each arm (at baseline and at final evaluation). DATA ANALYSIS: The unit of analysis in Cluster RCT's can change, depending on the level of inference: 1. Individual level ‐ e.g. clinics are the unit of randomization and patients are the unit of analysis 2. Cluster level ‐ e.g. Clinics are the unit of randomization and results are analyzed by clinic Both levels of analysis will be used in the data analysis of this study. Baseline and end of study process measures and outcome measures: Data will be entered twice (and validated) in Epidata (V3.1). Analysis will be done in Stata Intercooled Version 11. The analysis would use ANCOVA, linear regression and logistic regression adjusting for baseline values and the effect of clustering and/or mixed effects modelling. Descriptive analysis of the study population will be done, before between cluster‐ and within cluster analysis will be performed.

AB: This study compared the cost‐effectiveness of telemonitoring with standard monitoring for patients with diabetic foot ulcers. The economic evaluation was nested within a pragmatic randomised controlled trial. A total of 374 patients were randomised to either telemonitoring or standard monitoring. Telemonitoring consisted of two tele‐consultations in the patient's own home and one consultation at the outpatient clinic; standard monitoring consisted of three outpatient clinic consultations. Total healthcare costs were estimated over a 6‐month period at individual patient level, from a healthcare sector perspective. The bootstrap method was used to calculate the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio, and one‐way sensitivity analyses were performed. Telemonitoring costs were found to be €2039 less per patient compared to standard monitoring; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Amputation rate was similar in the two groups. In conclusion, a telemonitoring service in this form had similar costs and effects as standard monitoring.

YR: 2011
AB: INTERVENTION: Intervention group: Patients will complete a Web‐based chemotherapy‐associated toxicity questionnaire twice a day. The questionnaire is based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and consists of seven questions. The first six questions deal with capecitabine‐associated adverse events and their severity. Other symptoms not covered by previous questions can be reported using an additional open‐ended question. The questionnaire also includes a free‐text question about patient?s feelings on a particular day, thus allowing patients? psychological assessment. Based on the responses to the questionnaire, the e‐health system will assess the severity and evolution of symptoms and alerts will be triggered. Amber alerts will correspond to non‐critical conditions. In these cases, the e‐health system will generate automatic real‐time messages (texts or videos) aiming at advising the patient on how to manage the specific condition. Should the condition be serious, a red alert will be triggered and a nurse will contact the patient through a phone call. Patients in the intervention group will additionally receive the usual care. Patients in the intervention group will receive specific training on the use of the mobile phone or PC versions of the e‐health system. Control group: Patients will be assigned to a medical oncologist who will coordinate and oversee the patient?s medical care. In the first medical visit, a complete medical history of the patient will be obtained together with the results of complementary tests, which will allow an accurate diagnosis. Should chemotherapy become the therapeutic option, the doctor will then inform the patient about the treatment. The nurse will provide the patient with oral and written information about the medication, possible adverse effects and the care pathway to be followed. Additionally, the patient will be given information on what to do in the case of high body temperature or uncontrolled side effe CONDITION: Breast and colorectal cancer ; Cancer ; Malignant neoplasm of breast PRIMARY OUTCOME: Feasibility and safety of a new e‐health system (Oncomed) for the support of cancer patients during chemotherapy treatment SECONDARY OUTCOME: 1. Effect of Oncomed on chemotherapy‐associated toxicity control: ; 1.1. Number of toxicity‐associated interventions; 1.2. Toxicity evolution in each patient; 1.3. Number of treatment withdrawals due to elevate toxicity; 2. Quality of life (EORTC QLQ‐C30 questionnaire at baseline and after 3 and 6 chemotherapy cycles); 3.

AB: Objective To evaluate, from a societal perspective, the cost utility and cost effectiveness of a nonpharmacologic face‐to‐face treatment program compared with a telephone‐based treatment program for patients with generalized osteoarthritis (GOA). Methods An economic evaluation was carried out alongside a randomized clinical trial involving 147 patients with GOA. Program costs were estimated from time registrations. One‐year medical and nonmedical costs were estimated using cost questionnaires. Quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated using the EuroQol (EQ) classification system, EQ rating scale, and the Short Form 6D (SF‐6D). Daily function was measured using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index (DI). Cost and QALY/effect differences were analyzed using multilevel regression analysis and cost‐effectiveness acceptability curves. Results Medical costs of the face‐to‐face treatment and telephone‐based treatment were estimated at 387 and 252, respectively. The difference in total societal costs was nonsignificantly in favor of the face‐to‐face program (difference 708; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] ‐5,058, 3,642). QALYs were similar for both groups according to the EQ, but were significantly in favor of the face‐to‐face group, according to the SF‐6D (difference 0.022 [95% CI 0.000, 0.045]). Daily function was similar according to the HAQ DI. Since both societal costs and QALYs/effects were in favor of the face‐to‐face program, the economic assessment favored this program, regardless of society's willingness to pay. There was a 65‐90% chance that the face‐to‐face program had better cost utility and a 60‐70% chance of being cost effective. Conclusion This economic evaluation from a societal perspective showed that a nonpharmacologic, face‐to‐face treatment program for patients with GOA was likely to be cost effective, relative to a telephone‐based program.

AB: Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess whether a multicomponent cognitive behavioral group intervention is preferable to usual care in terms of (healthcare) costs and effects on fear of falling and activity avoidance. Methods: This economic evaluation was embedded in a randomized controlled trial among 540 community‐living adults in the Netherlands, aged 70 years and older who reported fear of falling and fear‐induced activity avoidance. The participants allocated to the intervention group received a multicomponent cognitive behavioral group intervention consisting of eight weekly sessions and a booster session. The sessions were aimed at instilling realistic views of falls, reducing fall risk, and increasing activity and safe behavior. Participants in the control group received usual care. Cost outcome measures were healthcare costs, and patient and family costs. Clinical outcomes were fear of falling and activity avoidance. All outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 2, 8, and 14 months by means of registration forms, self‐administered questionnaires, and interviews by telephone. Results: Participants were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 280) and control groups (n = 260). Costs for the intervention program were on average €276 per person. Total costs per person were comparable (€4,925 in intervention group and €4,828 in control group). Furthermore, favorable effects of the program were observed for fear of falling and activity avoidance. Conclusions: This study showed that the intervention program is preferable to usual care in terms of costs and effects. The program had comparable costs and significantly reduced fear of falling and associated activity avoidance among older community‐living persons. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.

AB: Introduction: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a therapeutic emergency that requires prompt care in a stroke unit (SU). In order to reduce regional inequalities and to promote uniformity in access to this technique, which is effective when carried out quickly, telemedicine‐assisted thrombolysis was developed in Burgundy within the Telestroke system. At the moment, no study compared costs (i.e. expenditures) and revenues (i.e. funding) associated with the management of patients presenting an IS in Burgundy after the implementation of the Telestroke system according to the management strategy: patients undergoing thrombolysis directly in a SU or Tele‐thrombolysis in a local hospital (LH) receiving telemedicine assistance from SU followed by transfer to the SU. Patients and method: All consecutive patients with acute IS confirmed by cerebral imaging who were treated with intravenous thrombolysis either at the SU or at a LH through a telemedicine procedure were included in this retrospective multicenter observational study between the 1st October 2012 and the 31st October 2013. Hospital costs and revenues were then collected and compared. The economic analysis was performed from the point of view of the healthcare centers (SU and LH). The secondary objectives were to compare the respect of the guidelines for the good use of r‐TPA (alteplase), its clinical efficacy and tolerance according to the management strategy. Results: Among the 92 patients included between the 1st October 2012 and the 31st October 2013, a total of 78 patients underwent direct thrombolysis in a SU and 14 thrombolysis in a LH with telemedicine assistance. A significant difference was found between the global cost per patient of according to the type of management: 13,998+/‐4155 for thrombolysis with telemedicine assistance in LH versus 11,645+/‐9778 for direct thrombolysis at the SU; P =0.13. With Tele‐thrombolysis, no significant difference was found between costs per patient and total revenue per patient (13,998 versus 13,436; P =0.46). With direct thrombolysis, costs per patient estimated was significantly greater than the revenue per patient (11,645 versus 7095; P <10‐3). From a clinical point of view, there was no significant difference between the thrombolysis at the LH with telemedicine assistance group and the direct thrombolysis at the SU group concerning the effectiveness and tolerance to r‐TPA. Discussion and conclusion: To be implemented and funded at a large scale, the clinical and budgetary impact of telemedicine need to be assessed. In our study the introduction of the Telestroke system did not significantly increase expenditure related to the management of IS compared with direct thrombolysis at the SU. But the distribution of revenues between healthcares centers need to be optimised. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB: Introduction: Self management of hypertension including self monitoring and self titration of antihypertensives is a novel intervention aiming to improve blood pressure control. Very little evidence exists regarding the cost effectiveness of self monitoring of blood pressure in general and self management in particular. This study aimed to evaluate whether self management of hypertension was cost effective. Methods: The telemonitoring and self‐management in hypertension trial (TASMINH2) was a primary care based randomised controlled trial comparing home monitoring of blood pressure with telemonitoring and self titration of anti hypertensive medication to usual care in people with poorly controlled hypertension. An embedded economic evaluation ran parallel to the main trial. It took a base case ofcosts from a UK Health Service perspective and analysed both cost per reduction in unit blood pressure and costs per QALY. Sensitivity analyses examined cost effectiveness from a societal point of view as well as evaluating the effect of missing values, different assumptions and bias due to high cost patients. Results: Self management of hypertension with telemonitoring was cost effective with an ICER for blood pressure reduction of £19/mm Hg (€15/mm Hg) ‐ implying that using self management with telemonitoring and titration of antihypertensive medication to reduce systolic BP by 1 mm Hg costs on average £19 (€15). In terms of quality of life, compared to usual care, using self management with telemonitoring and titration of antihypertensive medication was associated with a gain of 0.0179 QALYs translat ing into a mean cost of just over £5,600 (€4,462) per QALY gained. There was an 85% chance of this being cost effective given a willingness to pay of £20,000 (€15,936) per QALY gained. This result was robust to sensitivity analysis around the assumptions made including from a societal perspective and removing high cost patients. Conclusions: Self monitoring with self titration of antihypertensives and telemonitoring of blood pressure measurements is cost effective as well as leading to reduced blood pressure.

AB: Objectives: To compare the costs and costeffectiveness of managing patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) using telemonitoring versus usual care from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). Design: Within trial post hoc economic evaluation of data from a pragmatic randomised controlled trial using an intention‐to‐treat approach. Setting: 20 socioeconomically diverse general practices in Lothian, Scotland. Participants: 401 primary care patients aged 29‐95 with uncontrolled daytime ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) (=135/85, but <210/135 mm Hg). Intervention: Participants were centrally randomised to 6 months of a telemonitoring service comprising of self‐monitoring of BP transmitted to a secure website for review by the attending nurse/doctor and patient, with optional automated patient decision‐support by text/email (n=200) or usual care (n‐201). Randomisation was undertaken with minimisation for age, sex, family practice, use of three or more hypertension drugs and self‐monitoring history. Main outcome measures: Mean difference in total NHS costs between trial arms and blinded assessment of mean cost per 1 mm Hg systolic BP point reduced. Results: Home telemonitoring of BP costs significantly more than usual care (mean difference per patient £115.32 (95% CI £83.49 to £146.63; p<0.001)). Increased costs were due to telemonitoring service costs, patient training and additional general practitioner and nurse consultations. The mean cost of systolic BP reduction was £25.56/mm Hg (95% CI £16.06 to £46.89) per patient. Conclusions: Over the 6‐month trial period, supported telemonitoring was more effective at reducing BP than usual care but also more expensive. If clinical gains are maintained, these additional costs would be very likely to be compensated for by reductions in the cost of future cardiovascular events. Longer‐term modelling of costs and outcomes is required to fully examine the costeffectiveness implications.

AB: Background: This paper will report on the findings from an economic evaluation of traditional hospital follow‐up versus telephone follow‐up by specialist breast care nurses for patients treated for breast cancer in the United Kingdom (UK). Materials and Methods: We conducted a cost minimisation analysis from a National Health Service (NHS) perspective using data from a randomised controlled trial that demonstrated equivalence between hospital and telephone follow‐up in terms of psychological morbidity; 374 participants at low‐moderate risk of recurrence were recruited to the study. The study was carried out at two hospitals in the North West of Engalnd. In a primary analysis we compared NHS resource use for routine follow‐up (i.e. consultations, investigations and referrals) during a mean follow‐up period of 24 months. Secondary analyses included patient and carer travel and productivity costs incurred and the NHS and personal social services costs of care in the minority of patients who developed a recurrence of their breast cancer. Results: Participants in the telephone follow‐up group had approximately 20% extra consultations (634 versus 524). Telephone consultations were of longer duration and conducted by senior nurses whereas hospital clinic appointments were of shorter duration and often conducted by junior medical staff; this resulted in higher routine follow‐up costs in the telephone follow‐up group (mean difference £55, 95% bCI £29‐£77). There were no significant differences in the costs of treating recurrence between groups. Participants receiving hospital follow‐up had significantly higher travel and productivity costs (mean difference £47; 95% bCI £40‐£55). Conclusions: Telephone follow‐up by specialist nurses may be a useful strategy for reducing the burden on busy hospital clinics and providing a quality service. Although patients and carers will have fewer costs with telephone follow‐up, this approach will not necessarily lead to cost or salary savings for the health service.

AB: Introduction: Telephone support for rural and remote patients with heart failure (HF) is aimed at improving patient outcomes, but its cost‐effectiveness is unknown. Objectives: To determine if a telephone support program for patients with HF in rural and remote Australia is cost‐effective. Methods: We conducted an economic evaluation of a cluster randomised control trial of 405 patients diagnosed with HF in primary care practices throughout Australia. Practices were randomised to either telephone support in addition to usual care (n=188) or usual care only (n=217). Costs were estimated in both groups for HF‐related care over 12 months. QOL was measured by Minnesotta Living with heart failure questionnaire and QALYs from the EuroQOL. Both questionnaires were completed by all patients at baseline and 12 months Results: The mean cost of the telephone support intervention was $1051over 12 months above the cost of usual care. Costs in the intervention group were higher for medications (mean $1893 vs $990), all‐cause hospitalisations (mean $4837 vs $4747) and cardiologist fees (mean 1.85 visits and $127 vs 1.63 visits and $112). General practitioner fees were lower in the telephone support group with fewer visits (mean 5.85 visits and $368 vs 12.55 visits and $395). Despite the higher cost of all‐cause hospitalisations in the telephone support group, there were fewer hospitalisations (74 vs 114, adjusted HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.50‐0.89], p=0.06). The higher cost of all‐cause hospitalisation was attributable to more defibrillator implantations, which accounted for 20% of the hospitalisation costs. Telephone support over the 12‐month study period was estimated to be associated with an additional 0.031 QALYs at an additional cost of $2031 per patient, equating to an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio of $65,516 per QALY gained. Conclusion: Telephone support is likely to represent a cost‐effective means of improving outcomes among HF patients.

AB: Objective: Blood pressure telemonitoring with remote counseling (BPTM) represents a useful tool for effective management of hypertension (HTN). Unfortunately, the evidence provided by recent studies on economic benefits of this approach is incomplete. The aim of this research was to compare the costs and cost‐effectiveness of telemedicine‐based intervention and standard care in hypertensive patients. Design and method: The study enrolled 80 patients aged 18‐85 (median 53 years old) with uncontrolled HTN. The subjects were randomized to gender, age and baseline BP ‐ matched groups: BPTM group (n = 50) and usual care (n = 30) with clinic visits. Duration of follow‐up constituted 3 months. Economic evaluation consisted of total healthcare costs calculation both for BPTM and usual care settled in Euro currency. Cost of illness (COI), incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) assessment along with cost‐utility analysis (CUA) with the use of Short Form‐36 (SF‐36) were performed. Results: BPTM group had significantly larger decrease of systolic BP compared to standard care (‐16 ± 6 mmHg; p = 0,04) while the number of antihypertensive drugs in BPTM remained unchanged (+0,3 drugs; p = 0,15). COI was 2.36 times higher in BPTM than in usual care (196.9 € vs. 83.5€; p < 0.005). An ICER was 8.45 €/mmHg (95% CI 4.9 € to 12 €) per patient. BPTM improved quality of life (+2.9 for physical component SF‐36; p = 0.04) with 0,06 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient. The resultant CUA for BPTM was 2698 € per QALY for patient which is also cost‐effective at a willingness‐to‐pay threshold of 20383 € per QALY gained. Extrapolating target BP holdover effect to a ten‐year period, a cost‐benefit analysis showed that BPTM is more cost‐saving than usual care approach (‐672.5 € per patient). Conclusions: Blood pressure telemonitoring with remote counseling facilitate achievement of target blood pressure level in a cost‐effective and cost‐saving way. The management costs will be compensated by potential prevention of future expenses for complications.

AB: PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: to examine the costs and cost‐effectiveness of 'second‐generation' telecare, in addition to standard support and care that could include 'first‐generation' forms of telecare, compared with standard support and care that could include 'first‐generation' forms of telecare. DESIGN AND METHODS: a pragmatic cluster‐randomised controlled trial with nested economic evaluation. A total of 2,600 people with social care needs participated in a trial of community‐based telecare in three English local authority areas. In the Whole Systems Demonstrator Telecare Questionnaire Study, 550 participants were randomised to intervention and 639 to control. Participants who were offered the telecare intervention received a package of equipment and monitoring services for 12 months, additional to their standard health and social care services. The control group received usual health and social care. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: incremental cost per quality‐adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The analyses took a health and social care perspective. RESULTS: cost per additional QALY was £297,000. Cost‐effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that the probability of cost‐effectiveness at a willingness‐to‐pay of £30,000 per QALY gained was only 16%. Sensitivity analyses combining variations in equipment price and support cost parameters yielded a cost‐effectiveness ratio of £161,000 per QALY. IMPLICATIONS: while QALY gain in the intervention group was similar to that for controls, social and health services costs were higher. Second‐generation telecare did not appear to be a cost‐effective addition to usual care, assuming a commonly accepted willingness to pay for QALYs. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 43002091.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost‐effectiveness of a telehealth intervention for primary care patients with raised cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. DESIGN: A prospective within‐trial patient‐level economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Patients recruited through primary care, and intervention delivered via telehealth service. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with a 10‐year CVD risk ≥20%, as measured by the QRISK2 algorithm, with at least 1 modifiable risk factor. INTERVENTION: A series of up to 13 scripted, theory‐led telehealth encounters with healthcare advisors, who supported participants to make behaviour change, use online resources, optimise medication and improve adherence. Participants in the control arm received usual care. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost‐effectiveness measured by net monetary benefit at the end of 12 months of follow‐up, calculated from incremental cost and incremental quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs). Productivity impacts, participant out‐of‐pocket expenditure and the clinical outcome were presented in a cost‐consequences framework. RESULTS: 641 participants were randomised‐325 to receive the telehealth intervention in addition to usual care and 316 to receive only usual care. 18% of participants had missing data on either costs, utilities or both. Multiple imputation was used for the base case results. The intervention was associated with incremental mean per‐patient National Health Service (NHS) costs of £138 (95% CI 66 to 211) and an incremental QALY gain of 0.012 (95% CI ‐0.001 to 0.026). The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio was £10 859. Net monetary benefit at a cost‐effectiveness threshold of £20 000 per QALY was £116 (95% CI ‐58 to 291), and the probability that the intervention was cost‐effective at this threshold value was 0.77. Similar results were obtained from a complete case analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence to suggest that the Healthlines telehealth intervention was likely to be cost‐effective at a threshold of £20 000 per QALY.

Net monetary benefit at a cost‐effectiveness threshold of sigma20 000 per QALY was sigma116 (95% CI.58 to 291), and the probability that the intervention was cost‐effective at this threshold value was 0.77. Similar results were obtained from a complete case analysis. Conclusions: There is evidence to suggest that the Healthlines telehealth intervention was likely to be costeffective at a threshold of sigma20 000 per QALY.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To determine from a societal perspective the cost‐effectiveness and cost‐utility of telephone‐based support for management of pressure ulcers. STUDY DESIGN: Cost‐effectiveness and cost‐utility analysis of a randomised clinical trial. SETTING: Tertiary centre in India and Bangladesh. METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomised clinical trial comparing 12 weeks of telephone‐based support (intervention group) with usual care (control group). The analyses evaluated costs and health outcomes in terms of cm2 reduction of pressure ulcers size and quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. All costs were in Indian Rupees (INR) and then converted to US dollars (USD). RESULTS: The mean (95% confidence interval) between‐group difference for the reduction in size of pressure ulcers was 0.53 (‐3.12 to 4.32) cm2, favouring the intervention group. The corresponding QALYs were 0.027 (0.004‐0.051), favouring the intervention group. The mean total cost per participant in the intervention group was INR 43 781 (USD 2460) compared to INR 42 561 (USD 2391) for the control group. The per participant cost of delivering the intervention was INR 2110 (USD 119). The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio was INR 2306 (USD 130) per additional cm2 reduction in the size of the pressure ulcer and INR 44 915 (USD 2523) per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: In terms of QALYs, telephone‐based support to help people manage pressure ulcers at home provides good value for money and has an 87% probability of being cost‐effective, based on 3 times gross domestic product. Sensitivity analyses were performed using the overall cost data with and without productivity costs, and did not alter this conclusion.

AB: BACKGROUND: Telemedicine‐enabled stroke networks increase the probability of a good clinical outcome. There is a shortage of evidence about the effects of this new approach on costs for inpatient care and nursing care. METHODS: We analysed health insurance and nursing care fund data of a statutory health insurance company (AOK Bayern). Data from stroke patients initially treated in a TeleStroke network (TEMPiS ‐ telemedical project for integrative stroke care) between community hospitals and academic stroke centres were compared to data of matched hospitals without specialised stroke care and telemedical support. Costs for nursing care were obtained over a 30‐month period after the initial stroke. To rule out pre‐existing differences between network and control hospitals, costs of stroke care were also analysed during a time period before network implementation. FINDINGS: 1 277 patients (767 in intervention, 510 in control hospitals) were analysed in the post‐implementation period. An increased proportion of patients treated in intervention hospitals had a favourable outcome concerning the level of required nursing care. Patients in intervention hospitals had higher costs for acute inpatient care (5 309 € vs. 4 901 €, p=0.04), but lower nursing care fund costs (3 946 € vs. 5 132 €; p=0.04). There was no difference in relation to absolute total costs obtained in the post‐implementation period. However, nursing care costs per survived year were significantly lower in intervention hospitals (1 953 € vs. 2 635 €; p=0.005). No significant differences were found in the pre‐implementation period. CONCLUSIONS: Considering both health insurance and nursing care fund costs, the incremental costs for TeleStroke network care in hospitals are compensated by savings in outpatient care.

AB: Background: Evidence that home telemonitoring for patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) offers clinical benefit over usual care is controversial as is evidence of a health economic advantage. Methods: Between January 2010 and June 2013, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CHF were enrolled and randomly assigned to 2 study groups comprising usual care with and without an interactive bi‐directional remote monitoring system (Motiva). The primary endpoint in CardioBBEAT is the Incremental Cost‐Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) established by the groups' difference in total cost and in the combined clinical endpoint "days alive and not in hospital nor inpatient care per potential days in study" within the follow‐up of 12 months. Results: A total of 621 predominantly male patients were enrolled, whereof 302 patients were assigned to the intervention group and 319 to the control group. Ischemic cardiomyopathy was the leading cause of heart failure. Despite randomization, subjects of the control group were more often in NYHA functional class III‐IV, and exhibited peripheral edema and renal dysfunction more often. Additionally, the control and intervention groups differed in heart rhythm disorders. No differences existed regarding risk factor profile, comorbidities, echocardiographic parameters, especially left ventricular and diastolic diameter and ejection fraction, as well as functional test results, medication and quality of life. While the observed baseline differences may well be a play of chance, they are of clinical relevance. Therefore, the statistical analysis plan was extended to include adjusted analyses with respect to the baseline imbalances. Conclusions: CardioBBEAT provides prospective outcome data on both, clinical and health economic impact of home telemonitoring in CHF. The study differs by the use of a high evidence level randomized controlled trial (RCT) design along with actual cost data obtained from health insurance companies. Its results are conducive to informed political and economic decision‐making with regard to home telemonitoring solutions as an option for health care. Overall, it contributes to developing advanced health economic evaluation instruments to be deployed within the specific context of the German Health Care System.

AB: Objective: To investigate the cost‐utility of the internet‐based intervention "Featback" provided with different levels of therapist support, in comparison to a waiting list. Method: This economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective and was part of a randomized controlled trial in which participants (N = 354) with self‐reported ED symptoms were randomized to: (1) 8 weeks of Featback, consisting of psychoeducation and a fully automated monitoring‐ and feedback system, (2) Featback with low‐intensity (weekly) therapist support, (3) Featback with high‐intensity (three times a week) therapist support, and (4) a waiting list. Participants were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 3‐month follow‐up. Cost‐utility acceptability curves were constructed. Results: No significant differences between the study conditions were found regarding quality‐adjusted life‐years (P = 0.55) and societal costs (P = 0.45), although the mean costs per participant were lowest in the Featback condition with low‐intensity therapist support (1951), followed by Featback with high‐intensity therapist support (2032), Featback without therapist support (2102), and the waiting list (2582). Featback seemed to be cost‐effective as compared to the waiting list. No clear preference was found for Featback with or without therapist support. Discussion: A fully automated Internet‐based intervention for ED symptoms with no, low‐, or high‐intensity therapist support represented good value for money when compared to a waiting list. This finding may have important implications for clinical practice, as both the unguided‐ and guided intervention could allow for more efficient care and widespread dissemination, potentially increasing the accessibility and availability of mental health care services for individuals with ED symptoms. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB: Background: Falls are a serious cause of morbidity and cost to individuals and society. Evidence suggests that foot problems and inappropriate footwear may increase the risk of falling. Podiatric interventions could help reduce falls; however, there is limited evidence regarding their clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness. Objectives: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of a multifaceted podiatry intervention for preventing falls in community‐dwelling older people at risk of falling, relative to usual care. Design: A pragmatic, multicentred, cohort randomised controlled trial with an economic evaluation and qualitative study. Setting: Nine NHS trusts in the UK and one site in Ireland. Participants: In total, 1010 participants aged >= 65 years were randomised (intervention, n = 493; usual care, n = 517) via a secure, remote service. Blinding was not possible. Interventions: All participants received a falls prevention leaflet and routine care from their podiatrist and general practitioner. The intervention also consisted of footwear advice, footwear provision if required, foot orthoses and foot‐and ankle‐strengthening exercises. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the incidence rate of falls per participant in the 12 months following randomisation. The secondary outcomes included the proportion of fallers and multiple fallers, time to first fall, fear of falling, fracture rate, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and cost‐effectiveness. Results: The primary analysis consisted of 484 (98.2%) intervention and 507 (98.1%) usual‐care participants. There was a non‐statistically significant reduction in the incidence rate of falls in the intervention group [adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.05; p = 0.16]. The proportion of participants experiencing a fall was lower (50% vs. 55%, adjusted odds ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.00; p = 0.05). No differences were observed in key secondary outcomes. No serious, unexpected and related adverse events were reported. The intervention costs 252.17 more per participant (95% CI ‐69.48 to 589.38) than usual care, was marginally more beneficial in terms of HRQoL measured via the EuroQoL‐5 Dimensions [mean quality‐adjusted life‐year (QALY) difference 0.0129, 95% CI‐0.0050 to 0.0314 QALYs] and had a 65% probability of being cost‐effective at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold of 30,000 per QALY gained. The intervention was generally acceptable to podiatrists and trial participants. Limitations: Owing to the difficulty in calculating a sample size for a count outcome, the sample size was based on detecting a difference in the proportion of participants experiencing at least one fall, and not the primary outcome. We are therefore unable to confirm if the trial was sufficiently powered for the primary outcome. The findings are not generalisable to patients who are not receiving podiatry care. Conclusions: The intervention was safe and potentially effective. Although the primary outcome measure did not reach significance, a lower fall rate was observed in the intervention group. The reduction in the proportion of older adults who experienced a fall was of borderline statistical significance. The economic evaluation suggests that the intervention could be cost‐effective.

AB: Stroke results in long‐term disability for many people, and particularly for survivors of stroke who have cognitive impairments. However, a decreasing proportion of stroke patients are able to access or receive publicly funded rehabilitation. The investigators have shown in previous studies that in‐person delivery of the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO‐OP) rehabilitation approach to promoting attainment of everyday life goals has resulted in improvements in functional independence and executive function. In a small pilot study of tele‐CO‐OP with people with chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) (n=3), the investigators found the delivery method was feasible and that participants were satisfied with the treatment and demonstrated clinically significant improvements on personally meaningful activities. The investigators will investigate the feasibility, preliminary efficacy, and cost‐effectiveness of delivering CO‐OP in an online format to reduce disability post‐stroke. The study design is a single‐blind (assessor), randomized wait‐list control trial with a one‐month retention follow‐up. All therapy and testing sessions will be delivered online. We hypothesize that participants will demonstrate improvement in everyday activities and community participation.

AB: OBJECTIVE: The present study seeks to conduct cost‐utility analysis (CUA) of the Danish TELEKAT (Telehomecare, Chronic Patients and the Integrated Healthcare System) project. The TELEKAT project seeks to test and develop a preventive home monitoring concept across sectors for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. The concept of the TELEKAT project is to reduce admissions by enabling the COPD patients to conduct self‐monitoring and maintain rehabilitation activities in their own home. COPD patients with severe and very severe COPD were included in the study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This economic evaluation follows international guidelines for the conduction of a CUA alongside a clinical randomized controlled trial. The analysis is based on a health sector perspective. RESULTS: The mean incremental cost efficiency ratio, located in the southeast quadrant, shows that telerehabilitation is less costly and more effective than the rehabilitation given to the control group. The telerehabilitation program produces more value for money and generates savings on healthcare budgets. CONCLUSIONS: The telerehabilitation program appears to be more cost‐effective than the conventional rehabilitation program for COPD patients. Further studies of cost‐effectiveness with a focus on large‐scale studies are needed.

AB: BACKGROUND: Behavioural counselling with intensive follow‐up for obesity is effective, but in resource‐constrained primary care settings briefer approaches are needed. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of an internet‐based behavioural intervention with regular face‐to‐face or remote support in primary care, compared with brief advice. DESIGN: Individually randomised three‐arm parallel trial with health economic evaluation and nested qualitative interviews. SETTING: Primary care general practices in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a body mass index of ≥ 30 kg/m2 (or ≥ 28 kg/m2 with risk factors) identified from general practice records, recruited by postal invitation. INTERVENTIONS: Positive Online Weight Reduction (POWeR+) is a 24‐session, web‐based weight management intervention completed over 6 months. Following online registration, the website randomly allocated participants using computer‐generated random numbers to (1) the control intervention (n = 279), which had previously been demonstrated to be clinically effective (brief web‐based information that minimised pressure to cut down foods, instead encouraging swaps to healthier choices and increasing fruit and vegetables, plus 6‐monthly nurse weighing); (2) POWeR+F (n = 269), POWeR+ supplemented by face‐to‐face nurse support (up to seven contacts); or (3) POWeR+R (n = 270), POWeR+ supplemented by remote nurse support (up to five e‐mails or brief telephone calls). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a modelled estimate of average weight reduction over 12 months, assessed blind to group where possible, using multiple imputation for missing data. The secondary outcome was the number of participants maintaining a 5% weight reduction at 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 818 eligible individuals were randomised using computer‐generated random numbers. Weight change, averaged over 12 months, was documented in 666 out of 818 participants (81%; control, n = 227; POWeR+F, n = 221; POWeR+R, n = 218). The control group maintained nearly 3 kg of weight loss per person (mean weight per person: baseline, 104.4 kg; 6 months, 101.9 kg; 12 months, 101.7 kg). Compared with the control group, the estimated additional weight reduction with POWeR+F was 1.5 kg [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6 to 2.4 kg; p = 0.001] and with POWeR+R was 1.3 kg (95% CI 0.34 to 2.2 kg; p = 0.007). By 12 months the mean weight loss was not statistically significantly different between groups, but 20.8% of control participants, 29.2% of POWeR+F participants (risk ratio 1.56, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.51; p = 0.070) and 32.4% of POWeR+R participants (risk ratio 1.82, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.74; p = 0.004) maintained a clinically significant 5% weight reduction. The POWeR+R group had fewer individuals who reported doing another activity to help lose weight [control, 47.1% (64/136); POWeR+F, 37.2% (51/137); POWeR+R, 26.7% (40/150)]. The incremental cost to the health service per kilogram weight lost, compared with the control group, was £18 (95% CI ‐£129 to £195) for POWeR+F and ‐£25 (95% CI ‐£268 to £157) for POWeR+R. The probability of being cost‐effective at a threshold of £100 per kilogram was 88% and 98% for POWeR+F and POWeR+R, respectively. POWeR+R was dominant compared with the control group. No harms were reported and participants using POWeR+ felt more enabled in managing their weight. The qualitative studies documented that POWeR+ was viewed positively by patients and that health‐care professionals generally enjoyed supporting patients using POWeR+. STUDY LIMITATIONS: Maintenance of weight loss after 1 year is unknown. FUTURE WORK: Identifying strategies for longer‐term engagement, impact in community settings and increasing physical activity. CONCLUSION: Clinically valuable weight loss (> 5%) is maintained in 20% of individuals using novel written materials with brief follow‐up. A web‐based behavioural programme and brief support results in greater mean weight loss and 10% more participants maintain valuable weight loss; it achieves greater enablement and fewer participants undertaking other weight‐loss activities; and it is likely to be cost‐effective.

AB: Long‐term adherence to evidence‐based medications remains exceptionally poor. Half of all patients become non‐adherent within a year of treatment initiation. Interventions that improve medication adherence may have important clinical benefits across large populations, and may even be cost‐saving by reducing rates of costly and morbid clinical outcomes such as myocardial infarction and stroke. The Study of a Tele‐pharmacy Intervention for Chronic diseases to Improve Treatment adherence (STIC 2 IT) is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating whether a novel tele‐pharmacist‐based intervention improves medication adherence and disease control among individuals with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes who are nonadherent to their medications and who have poor or worsening disease control. The intervention consists of a brief telephonic consultation with a clinical pharmacist using behavioral interviewing techniques tailored to patient's level of health activation and progress reports of medication‐taking and disease control. Based on the barriers identified during the consultation, patients will be offered more intensive support including reminder and motivational text‐messages, video visits and pillboxes. Potentially eligible patients will be identified using data from paid‐prescription claims data and the electronic health record. The study is being conducted at 14 practice sites in a large multi‐specialty group practice with approximately 250 primary care physicians. Practice sites will be randomized to intervention or control. In intervention sites, the primary care physicians of potentially eligible patients will be asked whether they would like patients to be enrolled in the intervention.

AB: BACKGROUND: The study was conducted to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of enhanced multi‐disciplinary teams (EMDTs) vs. 'usual care' for the treatment of pressure ulcers in long term care (LTC) facilities in Ontario, Canada METHODS: We conducted a multi‐method study: a pragmatic cluster randomized stepped‐wedge trial, ethnographic observation and in‐depth interviews, and an economic evaluation. Long term care facilities (clusters) were randomly allocated to start dates of the intervention. An advance practice nurse (APN) with expertise in skin and wound care visited intervention facilities to educate staff on pressure ulcer prevention and treatment, supported by an off‐site hospital based expert multi‐disciplinary wound care team via email, telephone, or video link as needed. The primary outcome was rate of reduction in pressure ulcer surface area (cm2/day) measured on before and after standard photographs by an assessor blinded to facility allocation. Secondary outcomes were time to healing, probability of healing, pressure ulcer incidence, pressure ulcer prevalence, wound pain, hospitalization, emergency department visits, utility, and cost. RESULTS: 12 of 15 eligible LTC facilities were randomly selected to participate and randomized to start date of the intervention following the stepped wedge design. 137 residents with a total of 259 pressure ulcers (stage 2 or greater) were recruited over the 17 month study period. No statistically significant differences were found between control and intervention periods on any of the primary or secondary outcomes. The economic evaluation demonstrated a mean reduction in direct care costs of $650 per resident compared to 'usual care'. The qualitative study suggested that onsite support by APN wound specialists was welcomed, and is responsible for reduced costs through discontinuation of expensive non evidence based treatments. Insufficient allocation of nursing home staff time to wound care may explain the lack of impact on healing. CONCLUSION: Enhanced multi‐disciplinary wound care teams were cost effective, with most benefit through cost reduction initiated by APNs, but did not improve the treatment of pressure ulcers in nursing homes. Policy makers should consider the potential yield of strengthening evidence based primary care within LTC facilities, through outreach by APNs.

AB: BACKGROUND: As a result of long delays for physiotherapy for musculoskeletal problems, several areas in the UK have introduced PhysioDirect services in which patients telephone a physiotherapist for initial assessment and treatment advice. However, there is no robust evidence about the effectiveness, cost‐effectiveness or acceptability to patients of PhysioDirect. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether or not PhysioDirect is equally as clinically effective as and more cost‐effective than usual care for patients with musculoskeletal (MSK) problems in primary care. DESIGN: Pragmatic randomised controlled trial to assess equivalence, incorporating economic evaluation and nested qualitative research. Patients were randomised in 2 : 1 ratio to PhysioDirect or usual care using a remote automated allocation system at the level of the individual, stratifying by physiotherapy site and minimising by sex, age group and site of MSK problem. For the economic analysis, cost consequences included NHS and patient costs, and the cost of lost production. Cost‐effectiveness analysis was carried out from the perspective of the NHS. Interviews were conducted with patients, physiotherapists and their managers. SETTING: Four community physiotherapy services in England. PARTICIPANTS: Adults referred by general practitioners or self‐referred for physiotherapy for a MSK problem. INTERVENTIONS: Patients allocated to PhysioDirect were invited to telephone a senior physiotherapist for initial assessment and advice using a computerised template, followed by face‐to‐face care when necessary. Patients allocated to usual care were put on to a waiting list for face‐to‐face care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was the Short Form questionnaire‐36 items, version 2 (SF‐36v2) Physical Component Score (PCS) at 6 months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes included other measures of health outcome [Measure Yourself Medical Outcomes Profile, European Quality of Life‐5 Dimensions (EuroQol health utility measure, EQ‐5D), global improvement, response to treatment], wait for treatment, time lost from work and usual activities, patient satisfaction. Data were collected by postal questionnaires at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months, and from routine records by researchers blind to allocation. RESULTS: A total of 1506 patients were allocated to PhysioDirect and 743 to usual care. Patients allocated to PhysioDirect had a shorter wait for treatment than those allocated to usual care [median 7 days vs 34 days; arm‐time ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.35] and had fewer non‐attended face‐to‐face appointments [incidence rate ratio 0.55 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.73)]. The primary outcome at 6 months' follow‐up was equivalent between PhysioDirect and usual care [mean PCS 43.50 vs 44.18, adjusted difference in means ‐0.01 (95% CI ‐0.80 to 0.79)]. The secondary measures of health outcome all demonstrated equivalence at 6 months, with slightly greater improvement in the PhysioDirect arm at 6 weeks' follow‐up. Patients were equally satisfied with access to care but slightly less satisfied overall with PhysioDirect compared with usual care. NHS costs (physiotherapy plus other relevant NHS costs) per patient were similar in the two arms [PhysioDirect £ 198.98 vs usual care £ 179.68, difference in means £ 19.30 (95% CI ‐£ 37.60 to £ 76.19)], while QALYs gained were also similar [difference in means 0.007 (95% CI ‐0.003 to 0.016)]. Incremental cost per QALY gained was £ 2889. The probability that PhysioDirect was cost‐effective at a £ 20,000 willingness‐to‐pay threshold was 88%. These conclusions about cost‐effectiveness were robust to sensitivity analyses. There was no evidence of difference between trial arms in cost to patients or value of lost production. No adverse events were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Providing physiotherapy via PhysioDirect is equally clinically effective compared with usual waiting list‐based care, provides faster access to treatment, appears to be safe, and is broadly acceptable to patients. PhysioDirect is probably cost‐effective compared with usual care.

AB: AIMS: We wish to assess the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of remote monitoring of heart failure patients with cardiac implanted electronic devices. METHODS: REM‐HF is a multicentre, randomized, non‐blinded, parallel trial designed to compare weekly remote monitoring‐driven management with usual care for patients with cardiac implanted electronic devices (ICD, CRT‐D, or CRT‐P). The trial is event driven, and the final analysis will be performed when 546 events have been observed or the study is terminated at the interim analysis. We have randomized 1650 patients to be followed up for a minimum of 2 years. Patients will remain in the trial up to study termination. The first patient was randomized in September 2011 and the study is expected to complete in early 2016. The primary combined endpoint is time to first event of all‐cause death or unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. An economic evaluation will be performed, estimating the cost per quality‐adjusted life year, with direct costs estimated from the National Health Service perspective and quality of life assessed by the EQ‐5D, Short‐Form 12, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaires. The study design has been informed by a feasibility study. CONCLUSION: REM‐HF is a multicentre randomized study that will provide important data on the effect of remote monitoring‐driven management of implanted cardiac devices on morbidity and mortality, as well as the cost‐effectiveness of this approach.

AB: Objective: Blood pressure telemonitoring with remote counseling (BPTM) represents a useful tool for effective management of hypertension (HTN). Unfortunately, the evidence provided by recent studies on economic benefits of this approach is incomplete. The aim of this research was to compare the costs and cost‐effectiveness of telemedicine‐based intervention and standard care in hypertensive patients. Design and method: The study enrolled 80 patients aged 18‐85 (median 53 years old) with uncontrolled HTN. The subjects were randomized to gender, age and baseline BP ‐ matched groups: BPTM group (n = 50) and usual care (n = 30) with clinic visits. Duration of follow‐up constituted 3 months. Economic evaluation consisted of total healthcare costs calculation both for BPTM and usual care settled in Euro currency. Cost of illness (COI), incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) assessment along with cost‐utility analysis (CUA) with the use of Short Form‐36 (SF‐36) were performed. Results: BPTM group had significantly larger decrease of systolic BP compared to standard care (‐16 ± 6 mmHg; p = 0,04) while the number of antihypertensive drugs in BPTM remained unchanged (+0,3 drugs; p = 0,15). COI was 2.36 times higher in BPTM than in usual care (196.9 € vs. 83.5€; p < 0.005). An ICER was 8.45 €/mmHg (95% CI 4.9 € to 12 €) per patient. BPTM improved quality of life (+2.9 for physical component SF‐36; p = 0.04) with 0,06 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient. The resultant CUA for BPTM was 2698 € per QALY for patient which is also cost‐effective at a willingness‐to‐pay threshold of 20383 € per QALY gained. Extrapolating target BP holdover effect to a ten‐year period, a cost‐benefit analysis showed that BPTM is more cost‐saving than usual care approach (‐672.5 € per patient). Conclusions: Blood pressure telemonitoring with remote counseling facilitate achievement of target blood pressure level in a cost‐effective and cost‐saving way. The management costs will be compensated by potential prevention of future expenses for complications.

AB: BACKGROUND: Workplace mental health promotion (WMHP) aims to prevent and effectively manage the social and economic costs of common mental illnesses such as depression. The mental health of managers and employees within small‐medium enterprises (SMEs) is a neglected sector in occupational health research and practice, despite the fact that this sector is the most common work setting in most economies. The availability and propensity of SME staff to attend face‐to‐face training/therapy or workshop style interventions often seen in corporate or public sector work settings is a widely recognised problem. The 'Business in Mind' program employs a DVD mode of delivery that is convenient for SME managers, particularly those operating in regional and remote areas where internet delivery may not be optimal. The objective of the intervention program is to improve the mental health of SME managers, and examine whether employees of managers' whose mental health improves, report positive change in their psychosocial work environment. The mechanisms via which we aim to improve managers' mental health are through the development of their psychological capital (a higher order construct comprised of hope, self efficacy, resilience and optimism) and their skills and capacities for coping with work stress. METHODS/DESIGN: The effectiveness of two versions of the program (self administered and telephone facilitated) will be assessed using a randomised trial with an active control condition (psychoeducation only). We aim to recruit a minimum of 249 managers and a sample of their employees. This design allows for 83 managers per group, as power analyses showed that this number would allow for attrition of 20% and still enable detection of an effect size of 0.5. The intervention will be implemented over a three month period and postal surveys will assess managers and employees in each group at baseline, intervention completion, and at 6 month follow up. The intervention groups (managers only) will also be assessed at 12 and 24 month follow‐up to examine maintenance of effects. Primary outcomes are managers' levels of psychological capital (hope, resilience, self‐efficacy and optimism), coping strategies, anxiety and depression symptoms, self‐reported health, job satisfaction and job tension. Secondary outcomes are participating managers subordinates' perceptions of manager support, relational justice, emotional climate and job tension. In order to provide an economic evaluation of the intervention, both employees and manager rates of absenteeism and presenteeism will also be assessed. DISCUSSION: The intervention being trialled is expected to improve both primary and secondary outcomes. If proven efficacious, the intervention could be disseminated to reach a much larger proportion of the business community.

TI: E-Rehabilitation: aerobic Resistance Training for Stroke Survivors
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02938000

KY: Hemiplegia; Stroke
AB: Seven million Americans are stroke survivors and another four million Americans are expected to have strokes by 2030.1 Nearly 800,000 strokes occur annually and of these, 25% occur after a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).2 Put another way, stroke recurrence affects 30% of stroke survivors.3 Given the high burden of stroke among stroke survivors, preventing recurrence is a top priority for post‐stroke and post‐TIA management. Stroke survivors must cope with impairments in functioning that can range from facial droops to hemiparesis and aphasia. These physical challenges mean that even four years after stroke, 71% of survivors feel they have not completely recovered from the stroke.4 The peak oxygen cost (VO2) of participating in activities of daily living such as walking is higher in stroke survivors six months after stroke than able‐bodied individuals.5,6 This increased energy cost is related to decreased cardiorespiratory reserve, changes in tissue composition, and gait deviation and asymmetry.5,6 The exhaustion point for hemiparetic stroke survivors falls within the range of aerobic fitness required to perform activities of daily living (3‐5 METS [Metabolic Equivalents]).6 Small increases in aerobic capacity would therefore translate into the ability to perform activities of daily living.6 The American Heart Association (AHA) and American Stroke Association issued guidelines in 2014 recommending physical activity and exercise to improve stroke survivors' functional ability, quality of life, and morbidity of stroke recurrence.3 It is the goal of this study to improve physical activity adherence in stroke survivors and thereby improve their cardiorespiratory reserve and reduce depression. Secondary variables to be examined include functional ability, balance, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), rates of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events, and mortality. Exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation post‐stroke or post‐TIA Cardiac rehabilitation care post‐discharge for stroke survivors is not established standard of practice. Several groups have been evaluating the efficacy of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation, as provided to patients after acute MI, in post‐stroke populations. This intervention has been shown to be cost effective in post‐MI care, reducing healthcare cost overall (attributed to fewer re‐admissions) and per quality‐adjusted life year.12 Several groups have conducted small‐scale trials of cardiac rehabilitation among TIA and stroke patients with promising improvements in cardiovascular fitness outcomes.13‐16 Aerobic exercise for rehabilitation after stroke has been evaluated in small randomized controlled trials.6,17 One group conducted a randomized controlled trial of a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program in chronic stroke patients after ischemic events.14 Their intervention was twice weekly, supervised exercise on cycle ergometers (upper or lower body) to 50‐60% maximal heart rate.14 At the end of the ten‐week program, subjects in the intervention arm showed significant improvements in cardiovascular fitness as measured by peak oxygen consumption (VO2) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) after three minutes of exercise.14 Self‐reported depression and anxiety scores also improved in the intervention arm, though health‐related quality of life did not.14 The same group is now conducting a larger clinical trial called Cardiac Rehabilitation Adapted For Transient Ischemic Attack and Stroke (CRAFTS) expanding on the results of the earlier pilot.13,14 Another group in London, Ontario conducted a feasibility study evaluating the use of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR) in patients within 12 months of TIA or mild, non‐disabling stroke.15 In this prospective cohort study, 100 patients were enrolled and 80 patients completed the CCR with group‐based or home‐based progressive aerobic training for six months.15 Diet counseling in individual or group‐based sessions emphasized the Mediterranean diet.15 Patients were screened for depression and referred to a psychologist for anxiety, depression, and smoking cessation as needed.15 Medications were optimized to meet AHA recommendations regarding use of aspirin or anti‐platelet agent, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, statin, and blood pressure management with diuretic.15 The results of the feasibility study were promising with improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness, blood lipid profile, BMI, weight, waist circumference, smoking status, and Duke Treadmill Score.15 Although the study was not powered to evaluate morbidity of stroke/TIA and mortality, the recurrence of stroke was 0% among patients who completed intake/outtake and 4.6% including patients who left CCR.15 A third study, PREVENT, is a randomized controlled trial out of Nova Scotia, Canada currently enrolling patients post‐TIA or non‐disabling stroke to evaluate a program of rehabilitative exercise and education in improving risk factors.16 The trial aims to randomize 250 patients to control (usual care) or to a 12‐week comprehensive rehabilitation program comprising group‐ and home‐based exercise with aerobic and resistance training and weekly education classes.16 Primary outcomes to be measured include lipid profile, blood pressure, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c; secondary outcomes to be assessed are exercise capacity, walking endurance, cognitive function, depression, health‐related quality of life, and physical activity.16 The trial was not powered to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in preventing morbidity of stroke/TIA/cardiac events.16 AHA Recommendation In 2014, American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association released recommendations regarding physical activity in stroke survivors.3 Prior to starting, a pre‐exercise physical evaluation including electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate monitoring, and graded exercise testing. Recommended exercise is aerobic cardiovascular exercise 3‐5 times weekly for 20‐60 minutes; aerobic activity should achieve 40‐70% peak O2 or heart rate maximum.3 Additional exercise in resistance training two to three days weekly is also recommended. The proposed intervention differs from these studies in that it involves a one‐way communication via streaming video in addition to case management follow‐up phone calls. To our knowledge, the efficacy of this tele‐intervention has not been reported previously. Thera‐band® elastic bands Thera band® elastic bands (The Hygienic Corporation, Akron, Ohio) are versatile exercise training tools used primarily to provide graded resistance during strength training.22 They have been used in home‐based resistance training for stroke rehabilitation with improvement in strength, gait speed, and functional ability.22 Combined with aerobic activity, strength training of hip flexors, extensors, and abductors improved gait speeds between 3.6‐12.6 meters/minute in ambulatory stroke survivors after ten weeks of intervention.22‐24 A small study (sponsored by the manufacturer of Thera band®) found using Thera band® elastic band is comparable to using resistance‐training machines in activating exercised muscles, as demonstrated by electromyography (EMG).25 Community‐based training with physiotherapists guiding stroke survivors in the use of Thera band® elastic bands for resistance training over 16 weeks improves balance and strength.26 In addition to providing resistance, Thera band® can be used to assist stroke survivors in dorsiflexion during gait training. Patients who received gait training using Thera band® showed faster improvement in mobility than usual care.27 A guided, community‐based model is the most representative of e‐rehabilitation. Strength and gait improvements are comparable in supervised and unsupervised resistance training in stroke survivors.23 This study's recorded exercise videos are intended to visually demonstrate aerobic resistance training to community‐dwelling patients. Although the patients will remain unsupervised, exercise sessions will be entirely guided by a trained exercise physiologist. This pilot, randomized, controlled, double‐blinded study will compare a comprehensive lifestyle and exercise rehabilitation intervention to usual care in patients after acute stroke. The investigators of this study intend to evaluate an online exercise video rehabilitation program for stroke survivors with moderate disability compared to usual care. The intervention videos combine aerobic and resistance training using a latex resistance band, Thera band® elastic band, specifically designed for rehabilitation. The proposed study will be performed at the Kaiser Permanente (KP) San Diego Medical Center. Kaiser Permanente patients that are admitted with acute ischemic stroke, resulting in moderate disability, in the prior two weeks to enrollment range will be recruited in the medical center. Patients will be directly offered participation in the study by the principal investigator, at the time of hospital admission to the KP San Diego Medical Center with ischemic stroke. For patients interested in participating in the trial, screening based on written inclusion and exclusion criteria will be done by reviewing patient information in the electronic medical record system. If patient meets initial eligibility criteria, they will be notified by telephone. As part of usual care, all enrolled patients will have an initial study visit included within their post‐hospital discharge follow‐up visit. Informed consent will be obtained at this time, as well as subsequent collection of baseline data, including vital signs, social and medical history, demographic variables, and questionnaire response items. All patients will have an appointment at Positive Choice within two weeks of the initial visit for education training, further testing (aerobic capacity measures), and distribution of Thera bands to the intervention group. Within the subsequent week patients and family in the intervention arm will receive an educational outreach call which will include medication reconciliation and adherence, dietary adjustments, smoking cessation, physical activity, depression education, as well as how to access the physical therapy videos online. Videos are 20‐30 minutes with combination of aerobic and resistance training to be done in seated positions. Study staff will call patients 1 week after the aforementioned educational phone call to offer encouragement, ask about progress, and answer any questions the patient may have regarding the videos. To control patients, the call will be a brief reminder to continue to adhere to medical therapy. Study staff will also call all enrolled patients to screen for depression at 4‐week intervals, and to ensure coordination for depression treatment with primary care physician. Investigator will perform physical exam including NIH stroke scale at the completion of prescribed therapy. At this time, patient will be advised to continue physical activity with videos as part of AHA recommendation. The outcome status (in terms of toxicity, response, reason off study, progression, and survival) of all eligible patients will be reported. All eligible patients who begin treatment will be included in the analysis of survival and time‐to‐failure. The primary outcomes of this study are the impact on the depression scores and cardiorespiratory reserve change of stroke survivors as a result of the intervention videos combined with aerobic and resistance training using a latex resistance bands. Additional outcomes of this study are measurement of potential changes in body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), functional status, balance, incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, as well as adherence to exercise program.

Web‐based interventions have shown to be effective in reducing depressive symptom severity. However, it is not known whether web‐based interventions may also be effective in preventing the onset of MDD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the (cost‐) effectiveness of an indicated web‐based guided self‐help intervention (GET.ON Mood Enhancer Prevention) on the onset of MDD.Methods/Design: A randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to compare the (cost‐) effectiveness of the GET.ON Mood Enhancer Prevention training with a control condition exclusively receiving online‐based psychoeducation on depression. Adults with subthreshold depression (N = 406) will be recruited from the general population and randomised to one of the two conditions. The primary outcome is time to onset of MDD within a 12‐months follow‐up period. MDD will be assessed according to DSM‐IV criteria as assessed by the telephone‐administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐IV (SCID). Time to onset of MDD will be assessed using life charts. Secondary outcomes include changes on various indicators of depressive symptom severity, anxiety and quality of life from baseline to post‐treatment, to a 6‐month and a 12‐month follow up. Additionally, an economic evaluation using a societal perspective will be conducted to examine the intervention's cost‐effectiveness.Discussion: This is one of the first randomised controlled trials that examines the effect of an indicated guided self‐help web‐based intervention on the incidence of major depression. If shown to be effective, the intervention will contribute to reducing the disease burden due to MDD in the general population.Trial registration: German Clinical Trial Registration DRKS00004709. 2014 Buntrock et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB: Background: Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (cCBT) is an efficient form of therapy potentially improving access to psychological care. Indirect evidence suggests that the uptake and effectiveness of cCBT can be increased if facilitated by telephone, but this is not routinely offered in the NHS. Objectives: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of telephone‐facilitated free‐to‐use cCBT [e.g. MoodGYM (National Institute for Mental Health Research, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia)] with minimally supported cCBT. Design: This study was a multisite, pragmatic, open, two‐arm, parallel‐group randomised controlled trial with a concurrent economic evaluation. Setting: Participants were recruited from GP practices in Bristol, Manchester, Sheffield, Hull and the north‐east of England. Participants: Potential participants were eligible to participate in the trial if they were adults with depression scoring > 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9). Interventions: Participants were randomised using a computer‐generated random number sequence to receive minimally supported cCBT or telephone‐facilitated cCBT. Participants continued with usual general practitioner care. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was self‐reported symptoms of depression, as assessed by the PHQ‐9 at 4 months post randomisation. Secondary outcomes: Secondary outcomes were depression at 12 months and anxiety, somatoform complaints, health utility (as assessed by the European Quality of Life‐5 Dimensions questionnaire) and resource use at 4 and 12 months. Results: Clinical effectiveness: 182 participants were randomised to minimally supported cCBT and 187 participants to telephone‐facilitated cCBT. There was a difference in the severity of depression at 4 and 12 months, with lower levels in the telephone‐facilitated group. The odds of no longer being depressed (defined as a PHQ‐9 score of < 10) at 4 months were twice as high in the telephone‐facilitated cCBT group [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 3.42]. The benefit of telephone‐facilitated cCBT was no longer significant at 12 months (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.71). At 4 months the between‐group difference in PHQ‐9 scores was 1.9 (95% CI 0.5 to 3.3). At 12 months the results still favoured telephone‐facilitated cCBT but were no longer statistically significant, with a difference in PHQ‐9 score of 0.9 (95% CI‐0.5 to 2.3). When considering the whole follow‐up period, telephone‐facilitated cCBT was asssociated with significantly lower PHQ‐9 scores than minimally supported cCBT (mean difference‐1.41, 95% CI‐2.63 to‐0.17; p = 0.025). There was a significant improvement in anxiety scores over the trial period (between‐group difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.1 to 2.3; p = 0.037). In the case of somatic complaints (assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire‐15), there was a borderline statistically significant difference over the trial period (between‐group difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.8; p = 0.051). There were gains in quality‐adjusted life‐years at reduced cost when telephone facilitation was added to MoodGYM. However, the results were subject to uncertainty. Conclusions: The results showed short‐term benefits from the addition of telephone facilitation to cCBT. The effect was small to moderate and comparable with that of other primary care psychological interventions. Telephone facilitation should be considered when offering cCBT for depression.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To conduct a rigorous feasibility study for a future definitive parallel‐group randomised controlled trial (RCT) and economic evaluation of an enhanced rehabilitation package for hip fracture. SETTING: Recruitment from 3 acute hospitals in North Wales. Intervention delivery in the community. PARTICIPANTS: Older adults (aged ≥65) who received surgical treatment for hip fracture, lived independently prior to fracture, had mental capacity (assessed by clinical team) and received rehabilitation in the North Wales area. INTERVENTION: Remote randomisation to usual care (control) or usual care+enhanced rehabilitation package (intervention), including six additional home‐based physiotherapy sessions delivered by a physiotherapist or technical instructor, novel information workbook and goal‐setting diary. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary: Barthel Activities of Daily Living (BADL). Secondary measures included Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living scale (NEADL), EQ‐5D, ICECAP capability, a suite of self‐efficacy, psychosocial and service‐use measures and costs. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and 3‐month follow‐up by blinded researchers. RESULTS: 62 participants were recruited, 61 randomised (control 32; intervention 29) and 49 (79%) completed 3‐month follow‐up. Minimal differences occurred between the 2 groups for most outcomes, including BADL (adjusted mean difference 0.5). The intervention group showed a medium‐sized improvement in the NEADL relative to the control group, with an adjusted mean difference between groups of 3.0 (Cohen's d 0.63), and a trend for greater improvement in self‐efficacy and mental health, but with small effect sizes. The mean cost of delivering the intervention was £231 per patient. There was a small relative improvement in quality‐adjusted life year in the intervention group. No serious adverse events relating to the intervention were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The trial methods were feasible in terms of eligibility, recruitment and retention. The effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of the rehabilitation package should be tested in a phase III RCT. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN22464643; Results.

AB: Background: Telephone triage is proposed as a method of managing increasing demand for primary care. Previous studies have involved small samples in limited settings, and focused on nurse roles. Evidence is limited regarding the impact on primary care workload, costs, and patient safety and experience when triage is used to manage patients requesting same‐day consultations in general practice. Objectives: In comparison with usual care (UC), to assess the impact of GP‐led telephone triage (GPT) and nurse‐led computer‐supported telephone triage (NT) on primary care workload and cost, patient experience of care, and patient safety and health status for patients requesting same‐day consultations in general practice. Design: Pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial, incorporating economic evaluation and qualitative process evaluation. Setting: General practices (n = 42) in four regions of England, UK (Devon, Bristol/Somerset, Warwickshire/ Coventry, Norfolk/Suffolk). Participants: Patients requesting same‐day consultations. Interventions: Practices were randomised to GPT, NT or UC. Data collection was not blinded; however, analysis was conducted by a statistician blinded to practice allocation. Main outcome measures: Primary ‐ primary care contacts [general practice, out‐of‐hours primary care, accident and emergency (A&E) and walk‐in centre attendances] in the 28 days following the index consultation request. Secondary ‐ resource use and costs, patient safety (deaths and emergency hospital admissions within 7 days of index request, and A&E attendance within 28 days), health status and experience of care. Results: Of 20,990 eligible randomised patients (UC n = 7283; GPT n = 6695; NT n = 7012), primary outcome data were analysed for 16,211 patients (UC n = 5572; GPT n = 5171; NT n = 5468). Compared with UC, GPT and NT increased primary outcome contacts (over 28‐day follow‐up) by 33% [rate ratio (RR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30 to 1.36] and 48% (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.44 to 1.52), respectively. Compared with GPT, NT was associated with a marginal increase in primary outcome contacts by 4% (RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08). Triage was associated with a redistribution of primary care contacts. Although GPT, compared with UC, increased the rate of overall GP contacts (face to face and telephone) over the 28 days by 38% (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.50), GP face‐to‐face contacts were reduced by 39% (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.69). NT reduced the rate of overall GP contacts by 16% (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.91) and GP face‐to‐face contacts by 20% (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.90), whereas nurse contacts increased. The increased rate of primary care contacts in triage arms is largely attributable to increased telephone contacts. Estimated overall patient‐clinician contact time on the index day increased in triage (GPT = 10.3 minutes; NT = 14.8 minutes; UC = 9.6 minutes), although patterns of clinician use varied between arms. Taking account of both the pattern and duration of primary outcome contacts, overall costs over the 28‐day follow‐up were similar in all three arms (approximately 75 per patient). Triage appeared safe, and no differences in patient health status were observed. NT was somewhat less acceptable to patients than GPT or UC. The process evaluation identified the complexity associated with introducing triage but found no consistency across practices about what works and what does not work when implementing it. Conclusions: Introducing GPT or NT was associated with a redistribution of primary care workload for patients requesting same‐day consultations, and at similar cost to UC. Although triage seemed to be safe, investigation of the circumstances of a larger number of deaths or admissions after triage might be warranted, and monitoring of these events is necessary as triage is implemented.

AB: Randomized, controlled, multicenter, performance, cost assessment and economic evaluation clinical trial. An arm of the trial will consist of patients assigned to the intervention group (telehealth group: TG ), and the other arm will consist of patients randomized to the control group (routine clinical practice: RCP). For the economic evaluation, the perspective of the health system will be used. Therefore it only direct costs will be considered. In the TG arm also intervention costs it will be considered. Patient selection: Responsible researcher at each hospital center will coordinate the patient selection process. The researchers will identify candidate patients screening through hospital medical records. After this first screening, patients will be contacted and invited to participate in the study. In a personal interview, the researcher explains the study to the patient and deliver the information sheet, verifying that patient meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, obtains informed consent and then proceeds to patient randomization. To avoid bias from exclusions, researchers will hold record with patient exclusion causes. Every hospital centers will include on average 60 patients (30 in each arm). The inclusion of patients will be competitive; having centers including patients in the study until reaching the final sample size of 120 patients per arm. Randomization: To avoid selection bias, patients assigned to each group will be randomized. To ensure that the number of subjects in each arm is the same, a restrictive block randomization is performed. Randomization is performed using random number generation by computer and the block size of 10 units. Home Telehealth program: Vital sign devices being used: spirometer, pulse oximeter with capacity for heart rate monitor, blood pressure, Visionox® (device capable of measuring respiratory rate, compliance with the hours of oxygen, and the flow and pattern of oxygen used). Devices send data automatically to a modem by Bluetooth. Modem receives and transmits data simultaneously from the monitoring devices to a Central Monitoring Center (CMC). Data received by the modem are encrypted and sent to the telehealth monitoring platform via a 3G signal. The CMC is manned by registered nurses and operates during office hours, 7 days a week. Nurses will attend the patient's home for: the installation of the telehealth devices; to perform a thorough training of the patients / caregivers in the use of equipment and the COPD telehealth program. Patients will perform daily vital sign measurements at the same time, at rest, after administration of the medication and the pattern of oxygen used. Visionox® performs measurements of respiratory rate and oxygen adherence automatically. Measured data will be monitored on a daily bases by the nurses at the CMC. CMC will follow‐up information, filter for fle positives and false negatives, and use an application acting as a traffic light system: ‐ Green: meant that measurements had been taken and were within the predefined limits, and no further action was required. ‐ Yellow: "technical alert". This means that the measurements had not been taken or had not been received. This alert could lead to a "clinical alert" due to a lack of adherence or discouragement. When the parameters were not received the nurse at the CMC called the patient to find the reason behind the alert, and either ruled out medical causes or, if one, notified the researcher leading the study. ‐ Red: "clinical alert". Meant that a measurement exceeded the limits that were previously preestablished for each. Classification of severity of clinical alerts is performed by the CMC according to an algorithm. Depending n severity different early medical interventions are taken, or escalated to clinical responsible for early intervention.

AB: BACKGROUND: Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (cCBT) is an efficient form of therapy potentially improving access to psychological care. Indirect evidence suggests that the uptake and effectiveness of cCBT can be increased if facilitated by telephone, but this is not routinely offered in the NHS. OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of telephone‐facilitated free‐to‐use cCBT [e.g. MoodGYM (National Institute for Mental Health Research, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia)] with minimally supported cCBT. DESIGN: This study was a multisite, pragmatic, open, two‐arm, parallel‐group randomised controlled trial with a concurrent economic evaluation. SETTING: Participants were recruited from GP practices in Bristol, Manchester, Sheffield, Hull and the north‐east of England. PARTICIPANTS: Potential participants were eligible to participate in the trial if they were adults with depression scoring ≥ 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9). INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised using a computer‐generated random number sequence to receive minimally supported cCBT or telephone‐facilitated cCBT. Participants continued with usual general practitioner care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was self‐reported symptoms of depression, as assessed by the PHQ‐9 at 4 months post randomisation. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Secondary outcomes were depression at 12 months and anxiety, somatoform complaints, health utility (as assessed by the European Quality of Life‐5 Dimensions questionnaire) and resource use at 4 and 12 months. RESULTS: Clinical effectiveness: 182 participants were randomised to minimally supported cCBT and 187 participants to telephone‐facilitated cCBT. There was a difference in the severity of depression at 4 and 12 months, with lower levels in the telephone‐facilitated group. The odds of no longer being depressed (defined as a PHQ‐9 score of < 10) at 4 months were twice as high in the telephone‐facilitated cCBT group [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to 3.42]. The benefit of telephone‐facilitated cCBT was no longer significant at 12 months (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.71). At 4 months the between‐group difference in PHQ‐9 scores was 1.9 (95% CI 0.5 to 3.3). At 12 months the results still favoured telephone‐facilitated cCBT but were no longer statistically significant, with a difference in PHQ‐9 score of 0.9 (95% CI ‐0.5 to 2.3). When considering the whole follow‐up period, telephone‐facilitated cCBT was asssociated with significantly lower PHQ‐9 scores than minimally supported cCBT (mean difference ‐1.41, 95% CI ‐2.63 to ‐0.17; p = 0.025). There was a significant improvement in anxiety scores over the trial period (between‐group difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.1 to 2.3; p = 0.037). In the case of somatic complaints (assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire‐15), there was a borderline statistically significant difference over the trial period (between‐group difference 1.1, 95% CI 0.0 to 1.8; p = 0.051). There were gains in quality‐adjusted life‐years at reduced cost when telephone facilitation was added to MoodGYM. However, the results were subject to uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed short‐term benefits from the addition of telephone facilitation to cCBT. The effect was small to moderate and comparable with that of other primary care psychological interventions. Telephone facilitation should be considered when offering cCBT for depression. LIMITATIONS: Participants' depression was assessed with the PHQ‐9, cCBT use was quite low and there was a slightly greater than anticipated loss to follow‐up. FUTURE RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS: Improve the acceptability of cCBT and its capacity to address coexisting disorders. Large‐scale pragmatic trials of cCBT with bibliotherapy and telephone‐based interventions are required. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN55310481.

AB: Objectives: To investigate whether BPTM fits all three principles of value‐based approach: clinical benefit, cost‐effectiveness and improved patient reported outcome/experience measures (PROMs/PREMs). Methods: Study included 190 ambulatory patients (137 males, mean age 51 ± 17 years) with uncontrolled HTN assigned to BPTM group (110 patients) and usual care group (UC, 80 patients). Both groups had baseline and 3‐months follow‐up clinic visits. Between visits BPTM patients used simple, secure web‐platform allowing physician‐patient communication, storage and blood pressure (BP) and medication data exchange. Clinical efficacy endpoints included BP changes and BP target rate. Economic evaluation settled in Euro currency consisted of cost of Illness (COI), incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER); cost‐utility analysis (CUA) was performed using generic PROM (SF‐36). PREMs collection via PEQ chart. Results: BPTM group characterized by significantly larger decrease in BP (‐16 ± 6 mmHg SBP, p = 0,005;‐8,4 ± 3,4 mmHg DBP, p = 0,02) while the number of antihypertensive drugs remained unchanged (+0,3 drugs in BPTM group; p = 0,15). COI was x2.36 higher in BPTM (196.9 € vs 83.5 €, p < 0.005) and ICER was 8.45 €/mmHg/patient (95% CI €4,9‐12). BPTM improved PROMs (+2.9 for PH‐SF‐36, p = 0.04) with 0,06 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Resultant CUA for BPTM was 2698 €/QALY/patient at a willingness‐to‐pay threshold of 20383 €/QALY. PREMs improved (+10 points, p = 0,01). UC showed minor QoL changes (+1,3 in PH‐SF‐36, p = 0,56; +6 PEQ, p = 0,03). No association between BP and QoL results (P = 0,5 for all). Conclusion: BPTM being cost‐effective and cost‐saving tool incorporates both clinical benefits with the patient‐perceived value.

AB: BACKGROUND: Patients with neovascular age‐related macular degeneration (nAMD) usually attend regular reviews, even when the disease is quiescent. Reviews are burdensome to health services, patients and carers. OBJECTIVES: To compare the proportion of correct lesion classifications made by community‐based optometrists and ophthalmologists from vignettes of patients; to estimate the cost‐effectiveness of community follow‐up by optometrists compared with follow‐up by ophthalmologists in the Hospital Eye Service (HES); to ascertain views of patients, their representatives, optometrists, ophthalmologists and clinical commissioners on the proposed shared care model. DESIGN: Community‐based optometrists and ophthalmologists in the HES classified lesions from vignettes comprising clinical information, colour fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography images. Participants' classifications were validated against experts' classifications (reference standard). SETTING: Internet‐based application. PARTICIPANTS: Ophthalmologists had to have ≥ 3 years post‐registration experience in ophthalmology, have passed part 1 of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, Diploma in Ophthalmology or equivalent examination, and have experience in the age‐related macular degeneration service. Optometrists had to be fully qualified, be registered with the General Optical Council for ≥ 3 years and not be participating in nAMD shared care. INTERVENTIONS: The trial sought to emulate a conventional trial in comparing optometrists' and ophthalmologists' decision‐making, but vignettes, not patients, were assessed; therefore, there were no interventions. Participants received training prior to assessing vignettes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome ‐ correct classification of the activity status of a lesion based on a vignette, compared with a reference standard. Secondary outcomes ‐ frequencies of potentially sight‐threatening errors, participants' judgements about specific lesion components, participant‐rated confidence in their decisions and cost‐effectiveness of follow‐up by community‐based optometrists compared with HES ophthalmologists. RESULTS: In total, 155 participants registered for the trial; 96 (48 in each professional group) completed training and main assessments and formed the analysis population. Optometrists and ophthalmologists achieved 1702 out of 2016 (84.4%) and 1722 out of 2016 (85.4%) correct classifications, respectively [odds ratio (OR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.25; p = 0.543]. Optometrists' decision‐making was non‐inferior to ophthalmologists' with respect to the pre‐specified limit of 10% absolute difference (0.298 on the odds scale). Frequencies of sight‐threatening errors were similar for optometrists and ophthalmologists [57/994 (5.7%) vs. 62/994 (6.2%), OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.57; p = 0.789]. Ophthalmologists assessed lesion components as present less often than optometrists and were more confident about their lesion classifications than optometrists. The mean care‐pathway cost for assessment was very similar by group, namely £397.33 for ophthalmologists and £410.78 for optometrists. The optometrist‐led monitoring reviews were slightly more costly and less effective than ophthalmologist‐led reviews, although the differences were extremely small. There was consensus that optometrist‐led monitoring has the potential to reduce clinical workload and be more patient‐centred. However, potential barriers are ophthalmologists' perceptions of optometrists' competence, the need for clinical training, the ability of the professions to work collaboratively and the financial feasibility of shared care for Clinical Commissioning Groups. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of optometrists to make nAMD retreatment decisions from vignettes is non‐inferior to that of ophthalmologists. Various barriers to implementing shared cared for nAMD were identified. FUTURE WORK RECOMMENDATIONS: The Effectiveness, cost‐effectiveness and acceptability of Community versus Hospital Eye Service follow‐up for patients with neovascular age‐related macular degeneration with quiescent disease (ECHoES) study web application was robust and could be used for future training or research. The benefit of reducing HES workload was not considered in the economic evaluation. A framework of programme budgeting and marginal analysis could explicitly explore the resource implications of shifting resources within a given health service area, as the benefit of reducing HES workload was not considered in the economic evaluation. Future qualitative research could investigate professional differences of opinion that were identified in multidisciplinary focus groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN07479761.

AB: Introduction: Medico‐economic evaluation of OSAS (Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome) treatment by telemonitored PAP (Positive Airway Pressure) in comparison with the routine care without telemonitoring. Methods: This study involved 201 patients M/F (M = 66%) 18‐75 years with an AHI ≥ 30/hr, in France (Paris region), 12 sites (7 hospitals and 5 private medical centers). Three randomizations have been applied: telemonitoring using GSM technology, device (RESMED/PHILIPS), auto‐adjusted vs. constant PAP set at the P90 value measured at D7 After the setup of PAP, follow‐up visits at D7, M1, M3 were done by the home‐care provider and at M1 and M3 by the physicians. Data were fed into an electronic sleep medical record (DMS) everyday for review and alarms on compliance, leaks and residual index were set up for the HCP and the physicians. Patients had access to the dedicated site www. respiradom.fr, including the serious game “Inspiratio” and to their daily data in the DMS. Resource utilization was collected prospectively and valued from the viewpoint of the healthcare payer. Results: At inclusion both telemonitored and non‐telemonitored arms were identical: age = 51.9 ± 11 years, BMI = 33.3 ± 0.5 kg/m2, Epworth = 12 ± 5.5, AHI = 52.8 ± 20.3/hr on average. Residual AHI at M3 were not significantly different between the two arms: 2.6 ± 3.1/hr. Compliance with treatment at M3 was high and identical in both arms: 5.25± 1.97 hr with telemonitoring vs. 5.31 ± 2.09 hr without. Associated costs were 360€/3 months with telemonitoring and 320€ without (P < 0.0001). Cost‐efficacy analysis showed that telemonitoring is more expensive but associated with a slightly better outcome. Quality of life scores (SF36, FOSQ) were not significantly different. Patient satisfaction scores were positive with telemonitoring. Telemonitoring increased the physicians' workload, nevertheless they wished to continue its use. Conclusion: Telemonitoring is as efficient as routine care. It is more expensive but tends to be more effective. Patients and physicians are satisfied.

AB: BACKGROUND: Internet based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) has been demonstrated to be cost‐ and clinically effective. There is a need, however, for increased therapist contact for some patient groups. Combining iCBT with traditional face‐to‐face (ftf) consultations in a blended format (B‐CBT) may produce a new treatment format with multiple benefits from both traditional CBT and iCBT such as individual adaptation, lower costs than traditional therapy, wide geographical and temporal availability, and possibly lower threshold to implementation. The primary aim of the present study is to compare directly the clinical effectiveness of B‐CBT with face‐to‐face CBT for adult major depressive disorder. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is designed as a two arm randomised controlled non‐inferiority trial comparing blended CBT for adult depression with treatment as usual (TAU). In the blended condition six sessions of ftf CBT is alternated with six to eight online modules (NoDep). TAU is defined as 12 sessions of ftf CBT. The primary outcome is symptomatic change of depressive symptoms on the patient‐health questionnaire (PHQ‐9). Additionally, the study will include an economic evaluation. All participants must be 18 years of age or older and meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders 4th edition. Participants are randomised on an individual level by a researcher not involved in the project. The primary outcome is analysed by regressing the three‐month follow‐up PHQ‐9 data on the baseline PHQ‐9 score and a treatment group indicator using ancova. A sample size of 130 in two balanced groups will yield a power of at least 80% to detect standardised mean differences above 0.5 on a normally distributed variable. DISCUSSION: This study design will compare B‐CBT and ftf CBT in a concise and direct manner with only a minimal of the variance explained by differences in therapeutic content. On the other hand, while situated in routine care, ecological validity is somewhat compromised by the controlled manner in which the study is conducted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02796573 . Registered June 1st 2016. Currently recruiting participants.

AB: Background: While telemonitoring has not shown clear benefits, heart failure (HF) management programs had. It is unknown whether a management program based on telemedicine provides advantages compared to conventional management on a HF program. Objectives: Evaluate efficacy and costs benefits of a HF management program using telemedicine compared to standard HF management program. Methods: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing two management strategies of high risk HF patients: HFP (heart failure programme) or HFP + T (heart failure programme based on telemedicine). Telemedicine management consisted in daily telemonitoring of weight, blood pressure, heart rate and symptoms that were transmitted to a central station controlled by HF nurses. Teleintervention was carried out replacing the physical appointments by videoconference, promoting self‐care and performing therapeutic optimization. The determination of direct costs was performed using cost accounting methodology. Primary end‐point: non‐fatal HF events by requiring hospital attention at 6 months of inclusion (decompensations requiring parenteral treatment). Results: a preliminary analysis of the first 74 patients included was performed. Baseline characteristics: mean age was 77 years 46, 2% were women, 51.3% had preserved LVEF, 50% were in NYHA class III‐IV. From 74 patients, 37 were assigned to HFP and 41 to HFP + T. After a follow‐up of 6 months, HFP + T group experienced a significant reduction in the primary endpoint and a favorable trends in morbidity and mortality. HF non‐fatal event rate, HF readmission rate and mortality rates were 22%(p:0.007), 14.6%(p:0.09) and 9.8% (p:0.39) respectively. In Cox analysis adjusted for covariates, HFP + T group assignment was a risk reduction of the combined endpoint (all‐cause death or HF nonfatal events) (HR 0.36 95% CI [0.17 to 0, 76], P=0.008). Total direct cost of the cohort studied was E 666,829 (8,863 per patient+E 1,423). The average cost per patient was significantly lower in the HFP + T group compared with HFP group (4.350±1.257E vs. 13.625±2.378E; p<0.001) with a mean difference per patient between the two groups of 9274+E 2,650. Conclusions: Addition of telemedicine to a HF program means: (1) a significant reduction in the number and rate of HF‐nonfatal events and also risk reduction of the combined endpoint (all‐cause death or HF nonfatal event) with a positive trend in terms of morbidity and mortality. (2) a significant reduction of health costs. The magnitude of the observed reduction suggests their implementation is cost‐effective with a quick return in economic terms.

AB: BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in developed countries and diagnosis and treatment carries with it substantial morbidity and related unmet supportive care needs. These difficulties may be amplified by physical inactivity and obesity. We propose to apply a multimodal intervention approach that targets both unmet supportive care needs and physical activity. METHODS/DESIGN: A two arm randomised controlled trial will compare usual care to a multimodal supportive care intervention "Living with Prostate Cancer" that will combine self‐management with tele‐based group peer support. A series of previously validated and reliable self‐report measures will be administered to men at four time points: baseline/recruitment (when men are approximately 3‐6 months post‐diagnosis) and at 3, 6, and 12 months after recruitment and intervention commencement. Social constraints, social support, self‐efficacy, group cohesion and therapeutic alliance will be included as potential moderators/mediators of intervention effect. Primary outcomes are unmet supportive care needs and physical activity levels. Secondary outcomes are domain‐specific and health‐related quality of life (QoL); psychological distress; benefit finding; body mass index and waist circumference. Disease variables (e.g. cancer grade, stage) will be assessed through medical and cancer registry records. An economic evaluation will be conducted alongside the randomised trial. DISCUSSION: This study will address a critical but as yet unanswered research question: to identify a population‐based way to reduce unmet supportive care needs; promote regular physical activity; and improve disease‐specific and health‐related QoL for prostate cancer survivors. The study will also determine the cost‐effectiveness of the intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12611000392965.

AB: Study objective: Hereditary angioedema is a rare disease associated with unpredictable, recurrent attacks of potentially life‐threatening edema. Management of severe attacks is currently suboptimal because emergency medical teams are often unaware of new specific treatments. The objective of this trial is to test whether a dedicated national telephone care‐management strategy would reduce resource use during severe hereditary angioedema attacks. Methods: We conducted a cluster‐randomized multicenter prospective trial of patients with a documented diagnosis of hereditary angioedema (type I, II or FXII hereditary angioedema). Participants were enrolled between March 2013 and June 2014 at 8 participating reference centers. The randomized units were the reference centers (clusters). Patients in the intervention arm were given a national free telephone number to call in the event of a severe attack. Emergency physicians in the SOS‐hereditary angiœdema (SOS‐HAE) call center were trained to advise or prescribe specific treatments. The primary outcome was number of admissions for angioedema attacks. Economic evaluation was also performed. Results: We included 100 patients in the SOS‐HAE group and 100 in the control group. During the 2 years, there were 2,368 hereditary angioedema attacks among 169 patients (85%). Mean number of hospital admissions per patient in the 2‐year period was significantly greater in the usual‐practice group (mean 0.16 [range 0 to 2] versus 0.03 [range 0 to 1]); patient risk difference was significant: –0.13 (95% confidence interval –0.22 to –0.04; P=.02). Probabilistic sensitivity graphic analysis indicated a trend toward increased quality‐adjusted life‐years in the SOS‐HAE group. Conclusion: A national dedicated call center for management of severe hereditary angioedema attacks is associated with a decrease in hospital admissions and may be cost‐effective if facilities and staff are available to deliver the intervention alongside existing services.

AB: Objective This study aimed to estimate and evaluate the cost‐effectiveness and cost‐benefit of a guided internet‐ and mobile‐supported occupational stress‐management intervention (iSMI) for employees from the employer's perspective alongside a randomized controlled trial. Methods A sample of 264 employees with elevated symptoms of perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS‐10 ≥22) was randomly assigned either to the iSMI or a waitlist control (WLC) group with unrestricted access to treatment as usual. The iSMI consisted of seven sessions of problem‐solving and emotion‐regulation techniques and one booster session. Self‐report data on symptoms of perceived stress and economic data were assessed at baseline, and at six months following randomization. A cost‐benefit analysis (CBA) and a cost‐effectiveness analysis (CEA) with symptom‐free status as the main outcome from the employer's perspective was carried out. Statistical uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping (N=5000). Results The CBA yielded a net‐benefit of €181 [95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6043‐1042] per participant within the first six months following randomization. CEA showed that at a willingness‐to‐pay ceiling of €0, €1000, €2000 for one additional symptom free employee yielded a 67%, 90%, and 98% probability, respectively, of the intervention being cost‐effective compared to the WLC. Conclusion The iSMI was cost‐effective when compared to WLC and even lead to cost savings within the first six months after randomization. Offering stress‐management interventions can present good value for money in occupational healthcare.

TI: Helping Urgent Care Users Cope With Distress About Physical Complaints
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02298036
YR: 2014
AB: Background: Health anxiety costs £3 billion per year in unnecessary expenditure, much of it on unscheduled care and in‐patient admission. CCGs are incentivised to reduce emergency care use and the Department of Health is spending up to an additional £400 million per year to provide psychological treatment for this problem. Yet patients with health anxiety are reluctant to accept face to face psychological treatment. There is strong evidence that delivered in secondary acute care as a liaison psychiatry service psychological therapy it can be clinically and cost effective for two years. Government policy is to deliver this intervention in primary or community care where there is little evidence of clinical or cost effectiveness. Face to face delivery of this intervention through secondary care mental health and IAPT services has not been acceptable to these service users. Remotely delivered psychological treatment designed to assist coping with symptoms can be delivered by mental health services and may be both more acceptable to service users than face to face treatment in IAPT services and just as effective as in secondary acute care. Aims: To determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of remotely delivered cognitive behaviour therapy for health anxiety in repeated users of unscheduled primary or secondary care for physical symptoms without a physical health cause. To determine barriers and drivers to delivering such remote treatment and how such treatment might fit into a wider care pathway to enhance patient experience of care. Methods of research: Randomised controlled trial of 6‐10 sessions of cognitive behaviour therapy for health anxiety delivered by telephone or through the internet versus treatment as usual. Primary outcome is change in health anxiety from baseline to 6 months; secondary outcomes are persisting change in health anxiety to 12 months, emergency care use, generalised anxiety, depression, somatic distress, work and social adjustment and quality of life. We will assess economic outcome and qualitative analysis of barriers and drivers to delivery of intervention and view the intervention as part of an overall care pathway to provide alternatives to emergency care use. This will help network leads, practitioners and service users to shape the research so that it can provide the most information to enable putting the intervention into practice. Methods of implementation (putting into practice). A network lead, a networking practitioner and an associated network of practice will bridge work between the research team and practitioners, commissioners, strategic clinical networks, Health England (education) and the Academic Health Science Networks (AHSN) across the East Midlands to put the intervention into practice. The process will be iterative, identifying core features of the intervention that should not be varied and those parts of the intervention that may be adapted allowing a degree of adaptation to local requirements. Research plan: Design: Pragmatic individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) of CBT versus treatment as usual, stratified by site. Economic evaluation and qualitative analysis of barriers and drivers to the research, intervention and its implementation into practice will also be performed. There may be differences in the uptake and retention to both the intervention and the trial if the service user is recruited to the study through their own practice or through an urgent care service. In order to refine the efficiency of recruitment and retention into the RCT and the intervention, we will conduct a 12 month feasibility phase in two parts of the East Midlands, then roll out the study within the East Midlands before starting the study in other AHSN areas. Setting. Recruitment of service users from primary care, unscheduled primary or secondary care in the East Midlands, including rapid access services for problems such as chest pain. Delivery of intervention remotely by mental health services. Interventions. CBT delivered remotely. We will use an experienced CBT therapist, who was trained in the engagement and delivery of CBT to health anxious patients in primary care to deliver CBT and to supervise up to four therapists also delivering the same intervention one day per week, one from each mental health trust in the East Midlands (lead from Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust). The lead therapist will receive supervision from the lead therapist in the CHAMP study (Tyrer, 2013) to ensure consistency with the approach in that study and to understand any adaptations that are necessary to deliver this intervention remotely and to high utilisers of care. The number of sessions is dependent on the pace of engagement with the patient and the complexity of their problems, and is tailored to the individual formulation of the patient's problems by the therapist (Tyrer, 2013). The treatment intervention will address health anxiety with reassurance seeking and/or phobic avoidance with or without management of panic attacks, generalised anxiety or depression, communication with health professionals, current psychosocial problems and differentiation from other physical health problems. Treatment as usual will be that decided by the patient with their general practitioner and health professionals they consult for unscheduled care. Outcomes. Outcomes will be assessed single blind at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The primary clinical outcome is change in the 14 item self‐rated short week Health Anxiety Inventory (Salkovskis et al, 2002) from baseline to 6 months. Secondary clinical outcomes are contacts with unscheduled or emergency care, change from baseline to 12 months on the short week the 14 item HAI, 7 item GAD‐7 (generalised anxiety; Spitzer et al, 2006), 15 item PHQ‐15 (somatic distress; Kroenke et al, 2002), 9 item PHQ‐9 (depression; Kroenke et al, 2001), 8 item social function (WASA; Mundt et al, 2002), and 5 item quality of life (EQ5D; EuroQol Group, 1990). Economic analysis. A detailed resource profile will be established for the intervention versus usual care. A cost profile will then be attached to each arm. Cost utility and cost effectiveness assessment will be made from health and social care perspectives as recommended by NICE.

AB: BACKGROUND: Persistent depressive symptoms below the threshold criteria for major depression represent a chronic condition with high risk of progression to a diagnosis of major depression. The evidence base for psychological treatments such as Person‐Centred Counselling and Low‐Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for sub‐threshold depressive symptoms and mild depression is limited, particularly for longer‐term outcomes. METHODS: This study aimed to test the feasibility of delivering a randomised controlled trial into the clinical and cost effectiveness of Low‐Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy versus Person‐Centred Counselling for patients with persistent sub‐threshold depressive symptoms and mild depression. The primary outcome measures for this pilot/feasibility trial were recruitment, adherence and retention rates at six months from baseline. An important secondary outcome measure was recovery from, or prevention of, depression at six months assessed via a structured clinical interview by an independent assessor blind to the participant's treatment condition. Thirty‐six patients were recruited in five general practices and were randomised to either eight weekly sessions of person‐centred counselling each lasting up to an hour, or up to eight weeks of cognitive‐behavioural self‐help resources with guided telephone support sessions lasting 20‐30 minutes each. RESULTS: Recruitment rate in relation to the number of patients approached at the general practices was 1.8 %. Patients attended an average of 5.5 sessions in both interventions. Retention rate for the 6‐month follow‐up assessments was 72.2 %. Of participants assessed at six months, 71.4 % of participants with a diagnosis of mild depression at baseline had recovered, while 66.7 % with a diagnosis of persistent subthreshold depression at baseline had not developed major depression. There were no significant differences between treatment groups for both recovery and prevention of depression at six months or on any of the outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to recruit participants and successfully deliver both interventions in a primary care setting to patients with subthreshold and mild depression; however recruiting requires significant input at the general practices. The evidence from this study suggests that short‐term Person‐Centred Counselling and Low‐Intensity Cognitive Behaviour Therapy are potentially effective and their effectiveness should be evaluated in a larger randomised controlled study which includes a health economic evaluation.

AB: Background: Persistent depressive symptoms below the threshold criteria for major depression represent a chronic condition with high risk of progression to a diagnosis of major depression. The evidence base for psychological treatments such as Person‐Centred Counselling and Low‐Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for sub‐threshold depressive symptoms and mild depression is limited, particularly for longer‐term outcomes.

AB: BACKGROUND: The emergence of oral delivery in cancer therapeutics is expected to result in an increased need for better coordination between all treatment stakeholders, mainly to ensure adequate treatment delivery to the patient. There is significant interest in the nurse navigation program's potential to improve transitions of care by improving communication between treatment stakeholders and by providing personalized organizational assistance to patients. The use of health information technology is another strategy aimed at improving cancer care coordination that can be combined with the NN program to improve remote patient follow‐up. However, the potential of these two strategies combined to improve oral treatment delivery is limited by a lack of rigorous evidence of actual impact. METHODS/DESIGN: We are conducting a large scale randomized controlled trial designed to assess the impact of a navigation program denoted CAPRI that is based on two Nurse Navigators and a web portal ensuring coordination between community and hospital as well as between patients and navigators, versus routine delivery of oral anticancer therapy. The primary research aim is to assess the impact of the program on treatment delivery for patients with metastatic cancer, as measured by Relative Dose Intensity. The trial involves a number of other outcomes, including tumor response, survival, toxic side effects, patient quality of life and patient experience An economic evaluation adopting a societal perspective will be conducted, in order to estimate those health. care resources' used. A parallel process evaluation will be conducted to describe implementation of the intervention. DISCUSSION: If the CAPRI program does improve treatment delivery, the evidence on its economic impact will offer important knowledge for health decision‐makers, helping develop new follow‐up services for patients receiving oral chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy. The process evaluation will determine the best conditions in which such a program might be implemented. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT 02828462 . Registered 29 June 2016.

AB: Stroke rehabilitation requires repetitive, intensive, goal‐oriented therapy. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to satisfy these requirements. Game‐based therapy can promote patients' engagement in rehabilitation therapy as a more interesting and a motivating tool. Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet PCs can provide personalized home‐based therapy with interactive communication between patients and clinicians. In this study, a mobile VR upper extremity rehabilitation program using game applications was developed. The findings from the study show that the mobile game‐based VR program effectively promotes upper extremity recovery in patients with stroke. In addition, patients completed two weeks of treatment using the program without adverse effects and were generally satisfied with the program. This mobile game‐based VR upper extremity rehabilitation program can substitute for some parts of the conventional therapy that are delivered one‐on‐one by an occupational therapist. This time‐efficient, easy to implement, and clinically effective program would be a good candidate tool for tele‐rehabilitation for upper extremity recovery in patients with stroke. Patients and therapists can collaborate remotely through these e‐health rehabilitation programs while reducing economic and social costs.

AB: INTERVENTION: SISTAQUIT is a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) at 30 Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHSs), Aboriginal Medical Services (AMS) and General Practitioner (GP) practices across Australia. Each health service/GP practice will be randomly assigned to continue usual care (15 Control sites) or receive the SISTAQUIT health provider training in culturally appropriate smoking cessation care + resources at the start of the study (15 Intervention sites). The 15 Control sites will receive the SISTAQUIT training + resources at the end of the study (Intervention‐later group).. The SISTAQUIT Intervention comprises:: ‐ culturally appropriate training in smoking cessation care for health providers (2 hours) Health providers include GPs, midwives, nurses, Tobacco & Aboriginal Health Workers Ideally, all health providers at each service/GP practice (especially those who provide care for pregnant women) will undertake the training ‐ targeted educational resources: participant booklet & flip chart, health provider manual ‐ oral nicotine replacement therapy (oral NRT) ‐ participant smoking cessation information video loop All sites (Intervention + Control) receive: ‐ trial implementation training & support throughout the study ‐ reimbursement for trial activities The Intervention training comprises one 2‐hour session presented by both a GP specialiasing in smoking cessation care and an Aboriginal Health Educator. The GP will be presenting via a live, interactive webinar and the Aboriginal Health Educator will be onsite at the health service/GP practice (face to face training). Participants at study sites will be followed for the smoking cessation care they receive via surveys at trial follow up time points. Health providers may optionally participate in pre‐study, post‐training and end of study surveys to assess their skills and confidence in providing smoking cessation care for pregnant Indigenous women.

AB: Background: The emergence of oral delivery in cancer therapeutics results in an increased need for better coordination between all treatment stakeholders, mainly to ensure adequate treatment delivery to the patient. There is a significant interest in cancer care coordination programs, especially those combining Nurse Navigators (NN) and the use of new technologies. However, the potential impact of these combined strategies is limited by a lack of rigorous evidence. Trial design: A monocentric randomized trial (1,000 patients, 1:1) is designed to assess the impact of a cancer care coordination program namely CAPRI. This program is based on two NN and a web application. NN ensure remote patient monitoring, via phone calls and email. They also provide a link between hospital professionals, patients and primary care professionals (GP, private nurse, pharmacist, etc.) by giving them access to the web application with the patient's authorization. Patients can enter data related to their health. Alerts are sent to the NN in case of abnormal data. NN evaluate the alert level on the basis of algorithms and determine the necessary action. The study will evaluate CAPRI's efficacy in comparison with regular care during a 6‐month period for adult patients with metastatic cancer. Hypothesis is that with a closer monitoring of the patient, the management of toxicities is more efficient and results in fewer dose adjustments of oral cancer therapeutics and avoids unnecessary hospital visits. The primary research aim is to assess the impact of the CAPRI program on treatment delivery for cancer patients who started oral cancer therapy, as measured by Relative Dose Intensity. The trial involves several secondary outcomes: patient adherence, tumor response, survival, toxicities, patient quality of life and patient experience. An economic evaluation adopting a societal perspective will be conducted, in order to estimate the use of healthcare resources. A parallel process evaluation will be conducted to describe the implementation of the CAPRI program. Of the 1,000 patients to be recruited, 109 patients are currently enrolled since November 2016.

AB: Purpose: We report on the first randomized controlled trial of Internet‐supervised exercise therapy (ET) for upper extremity function performed by clients at home. One group performed conventional ET, while the other performed FES‐ET on a purpose‐built gaming workstation, the Rehabilitation Joystick For Computerized Exercise (“ReJoyce”). ET was tele‐supervised over the Internet 1 hour/day, 5 days/week in both groups. Relevance: Exercise therapy (ET), particularly when assisted with functional electrical stimulation (FES), can significantly improve upper extremity function after stroke, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, but regular ET is hard to deliver and maintain, particularly after clients return to their communities. Participants: Thirteen C5/6 tetraplegic people (7 men, 6 women) took part, five performing the study with one hand, then the other, for a total of 18 hands studied. Methods: Participants were block‐randomized into two groups, group 1 receiving tele‐supervised conventional ET 1 hour/day for 6 weeks, followed by a 1 month washout period and then ReJoyce FES‐ET 1 hour/day for 6 weeks. Group 2 received the same treatments in reverse order. Because five participants completed the study with both hands, the groups each had a sample size of 9. Primary outcome measure: Action Research Arm Test(ARAT). Secondary outcome measures: grasp and pinch forces and the ReJoyce automated hand function test (RAHFT). Analysis: A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for significant differences in outcome measures. A multivariate regression analysis was also performed. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all dependent variables. Results: ARAT scores improved significantly more after ReJoyce FES‐ET (13.0±9.8%) than after conventional ET (4.0±9.6%) (F = 10.6, p < 0.01). RAHFT scores also improved significantly more after ReJoyce ET (16.9±8.6%) than after conventional ET (3.3±10.2%) (F = 20.4, p < 0.01). Conclusions: (1) FES‐ET performed on a purpose‐designed gaming workstation resulted in more improvement in upper extremity function in tetraplegic subjects than conventional treatment. (2) Internet‐based tele‐supervision of ET is feasible and effective. Implications: The improvements resulting from FESET exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (MCID), which is often used as a criterion to introduce a treatment into best practice. The ReJoyce workstation provides a standardized and cost‐efficient means of delivery of ET. The combination of new technologies used in this study signal a radical change in upper extremity rehabilitation.

AB: BACKGROUND: Up to 160,000 people incur traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year in the UK. TBI can have profound effects on many areas of human functioning, including participation in work. There is limited evidence of the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation (VR) after injury to promote early return to work (RTW) following TBI. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a definitive, multicentre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of early, specialist VR plus usual care (UC) compared with UC alone on work retention 12 months post TBI. DESIGN: A multicentre, feasibility, parallel‐group RCT with a feasibility economic evaluation and an embedded mixed‐methods process evaluation. Randomisation was by remote computer‐generated allocation. SETTING: Three NHS major trauma centres (MTCs) in England. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with TBI admitted for > 48 hours and working or studying prior to injury. INTERVENTIONS: Early specialist TBI VR delivered by occupational therapists (OTs) in the community using a case co‐ordination model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self‐reported RTW 12 months post randomisation, mood, functional ability, participation, work self‐efficacy, quality of life and work ability. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment and retention rates. Follow‐up was by postal questionnaires in two centres and face to face in one centre. Those collecting data were blind to treatment allocation. RESULTS: Out of 102 target participants, 78 were recruited (39 randomised to each arm), representing 39% of those eligible and 5% of those screened. Approximately 2.2 patients were recruited per site per month. Of those, 56% had mild injuries, 18% had moderate injuries and 26% had severe injuries. A total of 32 out of 45 nominated carers were recruited. A total of 52 out of 78 (67%) TBI participants responded at 12 months (UC, n = 23; intervention, n = 29), completing 90% of the work questions; 21 out of 23 (91%) UC respondents and 20 out of 29 (69%) intervention participants returned to work at 12 months. Two participants disengaged from the intervention. Face‐to‐face follow‐up was no more effective than postal follow‐up. RTW was most strongly related to social participation and work self‐efficacy. It is feasible to assess the cost‐effectiveness of VR. Intervention was delivered as intended and valued by participants. Factors likely to affect a definitive trial include deploying experienced OTs, no clear TBI definition or TBI registers, and repatriation of more severe TBI from MTCs, affecting recruitment of those most likely to benefit/least likely to drop out. LIMITATIONS: Target recruitment was not reached, but mechanisms to achieve this in future studies were identified. Retention was lower than expected, particularly in UC, potentially biasing estimates of the 12‐month RTW rate. CONCLUSIONS: This study met most feasibility objectives. The intervention was delivered with high fidelity. When objectives were not met, strategies to ensure feasibility of a full trial were identified. Future work should test two‐stage recruitment and include resources to recruit from 'spokes'. A broader measure covering work ability, self‐efficacy and participation may be a more sensitive outcome.

AB: Background: ASyMS is a mobile‐phone based remote‐monitoring and alert system that enables real‐time monitoring of patients' chemotherapy (CT)‐related symptoms. Aims: eSMART aims to evaluate the short‐ and long‐term impact of ASyMS, compared with standard care, on patient reported outcomes and the delivery of care. Additionally, eSMART includes economic evaluation and the development of predictive risk models for experiencing CT‐related symptoms to enable personalised and anticipatory care. Methods: Patients newly diagnosed with breast, haematological, or colo‐rectal cancer and scheduled to receive at least 3 cycles of chemotherapy are recruited across 5 countries and 13 clinical sites. A total of 1108 patients will be randomised to either ASyMS or standard care. Patient demographic and clinical data are collected at baseline, and standardised PROMS are completed at baseline, during 6 cycles of chemotherapy and every 3 months for up to 12 months. The primary outcome measure is the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Secondary measures include: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐General, Supportive Care Needs Survey‐Short Form 34, State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory, Communication and Attitudinal Self‐Efficacy scale for cancer, Work limitations Questionnaire, EuroQol, and Client Services‐Receipt Inventory. Results: RCT data collection started in May 2016, and to date, 537 patients have been recruited. This presentation will provide an overview of the trial aims and design and reflect on study progress and challenges within the United Kingdom and wider European context. Conclusions: Setting up this multicentre study has been challenging, but eSMART is breaking new ground in multinational ehealth research. Patients are willing to accept randomisation into the study, and recruitment is ongoing.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the feasibility of recruitment, adherence and likely effectiveness of an e‐learning intervention for managers to improve employees' well‐being and reduce sickness absence. METHODS: The GEM Study (guided e‐learning for managers) was a mixed methods pilot cluster randomised trial. Employees were recruited from four mental health services prior to randomising three services to the intervention and one to no‐intervention control. Intervention managers received a facilitated e‐learning programme on work‐related stress. Main outcomes were Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), 12‐item GHQ and sickness absence <21 days from human resources. 35 in‐depth interviews were undertaken with key informants, managers and employees, and additional observational data collected. RESULTS: 424 of 649 (65%) employees approached consented, of whom 350 provided WEMWBS at baseline and 284 at follow‐up; 41 managers out of 49 were recruited from the three intervention clusters and 21 adhered to the intervention. WEMWBS scores fell from 50.4‐49.0 in the control (n=59) and 51.0‐49.9 in the intervention (n=225), giving an intervention effect of 0.5 (95% CI ‐3.2 to 4.2). 120/225 intervention employees had a manager who was adherent to the intervention. HR data on sickness absence (n=393) showed no evidence of effect. There were no effects on GHQ score or work characteristics. Online quiz knowledge scores increased across the study in adherent managers. Qualitative data provided a rich picture of the context within which the intervention took place and managers' and employees' experiences of it. CONCLUSIONS: A small benefit from the intervention on well‐being was explained by the mixed methods approach, implicating a low intervention uptake by managers and suggesting that education alone may be insufficient. A full trial of the guided e‐learning intervention and economic evaluation is feasible. Future research should include more active encouragement of manager motivation, reflection and behaviour change. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN58661009.

AB: Background: Telestroke services help to improve stroke thrombolysis access at hospitals where 24/7 on‐site expert coverage is challenging. However, regional telestroke can still leave services underserved especially during difficult to cover night‐time hours. In an effort to improve service access we explored the feasibility of a cost neutral reciprocal international arrangement between a Scottish and a New Zealand stroke service providing telestroke to each others' patients during the night‐time period taking advantage of international time zone differences. Methods: Following a complex implementation phase related to anticipated medico‐legal issues we conducted a sixteen week non‐randomised observational feasibility pilot weekdays 9pm‐9am. Patients were recruited prospectively and both patients and medical staff were interviewed following assessment. Time frames and outcomes were captured. Results: From 20 September 2013‐10 January 2014 five patients were assessed by an overseas consultant utilising telestroke. Two of these were treated and experienced excellent recovery. Three patients were not treated: one because of spontaneous symptom resolution, one due to intracerebral haemorrhage, and one because symptoms appeared non‐organic. All five decisions were deemed appropriate by the local clinicians upon full face‐to‐face assessment the following day. Both patient and staff feed‐back have been positive and supportive without any significant concerns raised. No significant technical issues occurred. Referral to treatment times were 63 and 50 minutes; these time frames are similar when patients are assessed locally and the delays relate primarily to obtaining brain imaging after hours as a technician has to drive in from home. Conclusions: Preliminary findings indicate that an International Telestroke Service is feasible. A much larger study is planned to more comprehensively assess treatment delays, patient outcomes, and service costs.

TI: Evaluation of an Intensive Individualized Smoking Cessation Program Delivered by Pharmacists
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03597607
YR: 2018
AB: One in five deaths in Canada is linked to smoking. It kills up to 50% of its users and over 7 million people each year. Smoking is also a risk factor for several harmful health consequences that affect the quality of life of those who smoke. It also results in substantial economic costs to society. Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) has the highest smoking prevalence of Canadian provinces; approximately 18.5% of Newfoundlanders smoke on a daily or occasional basis compared to the national average of 13.0%. The Conference Board of Canada reported this year that smoking costs the local NL economy approximately $135 million per year in direct healthcare costs and $53 million in indirect costs, for a total of $188 million. According to the CAN‐ADAPTT Smoking Cessation Clinical Practice Guideline, several intensive counseling interventions are the most effective for smoking cessation. Offering a combination of counseling and pharmacotherapy increases the likelihood that a person will try to quit by 40‐60%. Using this evidence, Memorial University's School of Pharmacy recently established a smoking cessation program at the Medication Therapy Services (MTS) Clinic. The program involves in‐depth pharmacist consultation, which includes pharmacotherapy and multiple follow‐up counseling sessions. The investigators propose to test the effectiveness of an intensive and abbreviated smoking cessation program (SCP) delivered by trained pharmacists at the MTS Clinic. They hope that findings from this study will inform stakeholders of the value of the program and of the pharmacists' role. If the program is determined to be effective it could be instrumental in applying smoking cessation programs in community pharmacies across the province, including rural and remote locations. To date there are only a small number of studies that use the randomized, controlled trial design to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacist delivered interventions. In addition, data is lacking on the perspective of and satisfaction with smoking cessation services from the eyes of someone who participates in the program. Therefore, this study proposes to execute a randomized control trial to determine the effectiveness of a pharmacist‐led smoking cessation program. Cost‐effectiveness and a qualitative assessment of participant's journey to quit smoking will also be assessed.

AB: Introduction: The AHA‐ASA Target:Stroke Program calls for innovative approaches to prehospital stroke care. We previously showed that mobile videoconferencing during ambulance transport is technically feasible in a rural EMS setting using an iPad‐based telemedicine system. We now hypothesize that this mobile telestroke system is clinically feasible as measured by agreement of the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) between face‐to‐face (FTF) and remote ambulance‐based assessments (iTREAT). Methods: The iTREAT system comprises an Apple iPad with retina display, high‐speed 4G LTE modem, Cisco Jabber secure video conferencing application, mounting apparatus, and magnetic external antenna. We developed 4 unique stroke and 2 unique stroke‐mimic scenarios to simulate prehospital stroke alerts. We recruited 3 standardized patients each assigned two scenarios, and randomly assigned each scenario to one of 6 major ambulance routes triaging to UVA Medical Center. To eliminate bias, we alternated the order of FTF and iTREAT evaluations. Statistical measures were inter‐ and intra‐rater correlation coefficient for the NIHSS and audio/visual(AV) quality ratings on a 6‐point scale (>4 indicating "good" or "excellent" connectivity). Results: For the 12 iTREAT and 10 FTF evaluations (two FTF missing data), intra‐rater correlation of NIHSS scores was consistently >0.91 (mean=0.96). Inter‐rater correlation for FTF evaluations was >0.89 (mean 0.96), and inter‐rater correlation for iTREAT evaluations was >0.84 (mean=0.94). AV quality ratings during all iTREAT evaluations were deemed "good" or "excellent" (audio mean=5.3, median=5.5; video mean=4.67, median=4.5). Both NIHSS correlation and AV quality rating increased over the study period. Conclusion: In this pilot feasibility study, NIHSS scores obtained via ambulance using our iPad‐based mobile telestroke system correlated well with in person assessments. These results support further research to determine feasibility and efficacy of this low‐cost mobile telestroke system in prehospital stroke care.

AB: BACKGROUND: Tele‐cardiology is the use of information technologies that help prolong survival, improve quality of life and reduce costs in health care. Heart failure is a chronic disease that leads to high care costs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of telemetric monitoring for controlling clinical variables, reduced emergency room visits, and cost of care in a group of patients with heart failure compared to traditional medical consultation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized, controlled and open clinical trial was conducted on 40 patients with Heart failure in a tertiary care centre in north‐western Mexico. The patients were divided randomly into 2 groups of 20 patients each (telemetric monitoring, traditional medical consultation). In each participant was evaluated for: blood pressure, heart rate and body weight. The telemetric monitoring group was monitored remotely and traditional medical consultation group came to the hospital on scheduled dates. All patients could come to the emergency room if necessary. RESULTS: The telemetric monitoring group decreased their weight and improved control of the disease (P=.01). Systolic blood pressure and cost of care decreased (51%) significantly compared traditional medical consultation group (P>.05). Admission to the emergency room was avoided in 100% of patients in the telemetric monitoring group. CONCLUSION: In patients with heart failure, the telemetric monitoring was effective in reducing emergency room visits and saved significant resources in care during follow‐up.

AB: AIMS: The Effectiveness and Cost of ICD follow‐up Schedule with Telecardiology (ECOST) trial evaluated prospectively the economic impact of long‐term remote monitoring (RM) of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). METHODS AND RESULTS: The analysis included 310 patients randomly assigned to RM (active group) vs. ambulatory follow‐ups (control group). Patients in the active group were seen once a year unless the system reported an event mandating an ambulatory visit, while patients in the control group were seen in the ambulatory department every 6 months. The costs of each follow‐up strategy were compared, using the actual billing documents issued by the French health insurance system, including costs of (i) (a) ICD‐related ambulatory visits and transportation, (b) other ambulatory visits, (c) cardiovascular treatments and procedures, and (ii) hospitalizations for the management of cardiovascular events. The ICD and RM system costs were calculated on the basis of the device remaining longevity at the end of the study. The characteristics of the study groups were similar. Over a follow‐up of 27 months, the mean non‐hospital costs per patient‐year were €1695 ± 1131 in the active, vs. €1952 ± 1023 in the control group (P = 0.04), a €257 difference mainly due to device management. The hospitalization costs per patient‐year were €2829 ± 6382 and €3549 ± 9714 in the active and control groups, respectively (P = 0.46). Adding the ICD to the non‐hospital costs, the savings were €494 (P = 0.005) or, when the monitoring system was included, €315 (P = 0.05) per patient‐year. CONCLUSION: From the French health insurance perspective, the remote management of ICD patients is cost saving. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT00989417, www.clinicaltrials.gov.

AB: Purpose: Results from the Danish cluster‐randomized trial of telehealthcare to 1,225 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the Danish Telecare North Trial, concluded that the telehealthcare solution was unlikely to be cost‐effective, by applying international willingness‐to‐pay threshold values. The purpose of this article was to assess potential sources of variation across subgroups, which could explain overall cost‐effectiveness results or be utilized in future economic studies in telehealthcare research. Methods: First, the cost‐structures and cost‐effectiveness across COPD severities were analyzed. Second, five additional subgroup analyses were conducted, focusing on differences in cost‐effectiveness across a set of comorbidities, age‐groups, genders, resource patterns (resource use in the social care sector prior to randomization), and delivery sites. All subgroups were investigated post hoc. In analyzing cost‐effectiveness, two separate linear mixed‐effects models with treatment‐by‐covariate interactions were applied: one for quality‐adjusted lifeyear (QALY) gain and one for total healthcare and social sector costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used for each subgroup result in order to quantify the uncertainty around the cost‐effectiveness results. Results: The study concludes that, across the COPD severities, patients with severe COPD (GOLD 3 classification) are likely to be the most cost‐effective group. This is primarily due to lower hospital‐admission and primary‐care costs. Telehealthcare for patients younger than 60 years is also more likely to be cost‐effective than for older COPD patients. Overall, results indicate that existing resource patterns of patients and variations in delivery‐site practices might have a strong influence on cost‐effectiveness, possibly stronger than the included health or sociodemographic sources of heterogeneity. Conclusion: Future research should focus more on sources of heterogeneity found in the implementation context and the way telehealthcare is adopted (eg, by integrating formative evaluation into cost‐effectiveness analyses).

AB: PURPOSE: Few studies have addressed the effects of caregiver interventions on the costs of care for the care recipient. This study evaluated the effects of a caregiver education and support group delivered via the telephone on care recipient health care utilization and cost. DESIGN AND METHODS: The Telehealth Education Program (TEP) is a manualized program of education and support designed for caregivers of veterans with moderate‐to‐severe dementia. One hundred fifty‐eight spousal caregivers were randomly assigned to either the ten 1‐hr sessions of TEP or the usual care (UC). Health care utilization and cost data were extracted from veterans Information System Technology Architecture databases and included outpatient, inpatient, and nursing home data within the VA. RESULTS: Total health care cost data showed a significant (p = .039) average cost savings of $2,768 per patient at 6 months for TEP as compared with UC, but these were not maintained at 1 year. All costs included in the total costs measure contributed to this difference. Inpatient, outpatient, and nursing home costs were all assessed separately, but only nursing home costs reached significance (p = .009), with a savings of $1,057 per patient at 6 months. IMPLICATIONS: The TEP caregiver intervention resulted in short‐term cost savings for veteran care recipients. Future studies of caregiver interventions should examine their effects on costs of care for the care recipients in addition to their effects on caregiver outcomes.

AB: Background and aims: The increased use of the internet is changing the way health care providers and the general population can interact. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease with special needs related to achieve good metabolic control in order to avoid the development of chronic complications. To achieve this goal, telematics systems (TS) may be useful. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and satisfaction of patients with a telematics system based on an online platform. Materials and methods: This is a pilot, multicentre, randomized, monitored non‐PAS study including 49 Type 2 diabetic patients (18 to 65 years old) receiving insulin treatment. The study consisted of two cohorts: Standard Management Arm (SM): 25 patients following routine clinical practice and Comprehensive Management Arm (CM): 24 patients monitored through comprehensive clinical care between Primary Healthcare and Specialized Healthcare, supported by telemedicine tools. Patients on CM sent information about glycaemia and insulin dose monthly through the TS and doctors made adjustment of treatment according to glycaemia values. Efficacy was measured in terms of HbA1c, number of episodes of hyper and hypoglycaemia. A satisfaction survey was completed by the patients before and at the end of the study. Costs were also analysed. Results: HbA1c improved in 57,9%of patients on CMvs 54,55%on SM (p value >0,05) over a median of 6 months follow‐up duration. Symptomatic hypoglycaemic and especially nocturnal episodes showed better evolution in CM group although we did not found statistically significant differences related to the small size of the sample. Patients onCMshowed an improvement in satisfaction with the use of TS according to the comfort in the use of this technology (7, 6 vs 8, 7 p value =0, 04) at the end of the study. At the end of the 6‐month Study, there were 68 onsite consultations less in the CM arm versus SMarm, representing savings of €3,672. Conclusion: Results found in this study suggest that CMintervention can lead to improvement in glycaemic control and self‐management in diabetes care. Telematics systems can help to diminish health care resources use and this can contribute to a reduction in economic costs although we have to consider the short time of the follow up period. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the economic impact of these strategies on Diabetes Care.

AB: Introduction This study examined the effect of a telehealth intervention on the control of type 2 diabetes and subsequent potential cost‐savings to the health system. Methods This prospective randomised controlled trial randomised adults with type 2 diabetes to the intervention (diabetes program) or control (usual care) arm. Key eligibility criteria included an HbA1c level of at least 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) without severe or unstable comorbidities. All participants continued their usual healthcare, but participants in the intervention arm received additional diabetes care from a diabetes care coordinator via a home monitor that captured clinical measures. Data collected included biomedical, quality of life measures and healthcare (GP, outpatient and inpatient) costs. The primary outcome was HbA1c collected at baseline and 6 months. Analysis was conducted on a complete case intention‐to‐treat basis. The healthcare system perspective was taken to calculate the incremental cost per percentage‐point reduction in HbA1c. Results Results from 63 participants from each study arm were analysed. HbA1c in the intervention group decreased from a median 68 mmol/mol (8.4%) to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%), and remained unchanged in the control group at median 65 mmol/mol (8.1%) at the 6‐month endpoint. The intervention effect on HbA1c change was statistically significant ( p = .004). Total healthcare costs in the intervention group, including the intervention costs, were lower (mean $3781 vs. $4662; p < .001) compared with usual care. Discussion There was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant benefit from the telehealth intervention at a lower cost; thus, telehealth was cost‐saving and produced greater health benefits compared with usual care.

AB: BACKGROUND: Missed hospital appointments are a major cause of inefficiency worldwide. Healthcare providers are increasingly using Short Message Service reminders to reduce 'Did Not Attend' (DNA) rates. Systematic reviews show that sending such reminders is effective, but there is no evidence on whether their impact is affected by their content. Accordingly, we undertook two randomised controlled trials that tested the impact of rephrasing appointment reminders on DNA rates in the United Kingdom. TRIAL METHODS: Participants were outpatients with a valid mobile telephone number and an outpatient appointment between November 2013 and January 2014 (Trial One, 10,111 participants) or March and May 2014 (Trial Two, 9,848 participants). Appointments were randomly allocated to one of four reminder messages, which were issued five days in advance. Message assignment was then compared against appointment outcomes (appointment attendance, DNA, cancellation by patient). RESULTS: In Trial One, a message including the cost of a missed appointment to the health system produced a DNA rate of 8.4%, compared to 11.1% for the existing message (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61‐0.89, P<0.01). Trial Two replicated this effect (DNA rate 8.2%), but also found that expressing the same concept in general terms was significantly less effective (DNA rate 9.9%, OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.00‐1.48, P<0.05). Moving from the existing reminder to the more effective costs message would result in 5,800 fewer missed appointments per year in the National Health Service Trust in question, at no additional cost. The study's main limitations are that it took place in a single location in England, and that it required accurate phone records, which were only obtained for 20% of eligible patients. We conclude that missed appointments can be reduced, for no additional cost, by introducing persuasive messages to appointment reminders. Future studies could examine the impact of varying reminder messages in other health systems. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Controlled‐Trials.com 49432571.

AB: BACKGROUND: Pazopanib was noninferior to sunitinib in progression‐free survival in a phase III, open‐label, randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of the 2 drugs for treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A secondary analysis of this trial conducted on patient‐reported health care resource utilization (HCRU) endpoints revealed significantly fewer monthly telephone consultations and emergency department visits among patients treated with pazopanib over the first 6 months of treatment. OBJECTIVES: To (a) compare total costs of HCRU and adverse events (AEs) in patients with advanced RCC receiving first‐line pazopanib or sunitinib from the phase III clinical trial and (b) perform a post hoc economic analysis that applied direct medical care and pharmacy unit costs, obtained from the Truven Health MarketScan Databases, to HCRU and AE rates. METHODS: Total HCRU costs included components for provider contacts, diagnostics, hospitalizations, procedures, and study/nonstudy drugs. Patients were stratified by the presence or absence of an AE in order to estimate costs attributable to AEs. Costs were adjusted to 2013 U.S. dollars. The highest 1[%] of cost outliers were equally excluded from each group. Univariate (t‐test and Kaplan‐Meier sample average [[]KMSA]) and multivariate (using treatment group and region as covariates) analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 906 patients (pazopanib, n = 454; sunitinib, n = 452) reported HCRU; higher rates were observed for sunitinib. In unadjusted cost analyses, the mean total costs for pazopanib‐treated patients were 8.0[%] lower than those treated with sunitinib ($80,464 vs. $86,886; P = 0.20). The difference in KMSA‐estimated costs was significantly higher for sunitinib versus pazopanib ($156,128 vs. $143,585; P = 0.003). Adjusted cost differences between arms consistently suggested higher costs for sunitinib. Among patients who experienced = 1 AE, costs were $8,118 higher for pazopanib‐treated patients and $14,343 for sunitinib‐treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that health care costs were lower among patients with advanced RCC treated first‐line with pazopanib versus sunitinib.

AB: We compared the costs and cost‐effectiveness of telemonitoring vs usual care for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A total of 256 patients were randomised to either telemonitoring or usual care. In the telemonitoring arm, the touch‐screen telemonitoring equipment transmitted data to clinical teams monitoring the patients. Total healthcare costs were estimated over a 12‐month period from a National Health Service perspective and quality adjusted life year (QALYs) were estimated by the EQ‐5D tool. Telemonitoring was not significantly more costly than usual care (mean difference per patient £2065.90 (P < 0.18). The increased costs were predominantly due to telemonitoring service costs and non‐significantly higher secondary care costs. Telemonitoring for COPD was not cost‐effective at a base case of £137,277 per QALY with only 15% probability of being cost‐effective at the usual threshold of £30,000 per QALY. Although there was some statistical and methodological uncertainty in the measures used, telemonitoring was not cost‐effective in the sensitivity analyses performed. It seems unlikely that a telemonitoring service of the kind that was trialled would be cost‐effective in providing care for people with COPD.

AB: RATIONALE: Increasing attention has been placed on identifying and validating innovative COPD care models such as Telehealth (TH), particularly for high cost patients with severe COPD and/or frequent acute exacerbations. METHODS: PROMETE II is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial lasting 12‐months conducted in five hospitals in Madrid, Spain. Severe stable COPD patients (FEV1 below 50% predicted and 6 weeks without a COPD exacerbation) were randomized to either a specific monitoring protocol with TH or routine clinical practice (RCP). The main objective was to reduce the number of COPD exacerbations leading to ER visits/hospital admissions. RESULTS: 237 COPD patients were recruited, and 229 (96.6%) were randomized to TH (n=115) or RCP (n=114). Participants had a mean±SD age of 71±8 years and 80% were men. There were no statistical differences in the baseline parameters of both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the primary efficacy analysis of the proportion of participants who had a severe COPD exacerbation leading to ER visits or a hospital admission (59.5% in TH vs. 55.7% in RCP; p=0.556). Similarly, the mean number of exacerbations over the 12‐month period was comparable between groups, 1.0 in TH vs. 0.9 in RCP (p=0.286). However, there was a non‐significant trend towards a shorter mean total duration of hospitalization in the TH group (18.9±16.4 days) compared to the RCP group (22.3±19.7 days), p=0.353, and of fewer days in the ICU, 6.0±4.6 vs.13.3±11.1 days, p=0.349. At month 12, the number of all‐cause deaths was comparable between groups (11 in TH vs. 13 in RCP). Lastly, telehealth was evaluated highly positively by both participating physicians and patients. CONCLUSION: We conclude that remote patient management using this monitoring protocol did not reduce the COPD‐related ER visits or hospital admissions compared to routine clinical care within 12 months.

AB: Objective: Compare the effects and costs of remotely monitored exercise‐based cardiac telerehabilitation (REMOTE‐CR) with centre‐based programmes (CBexCR) in adults with coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods: Participants were randomised to receive 12 weeks of telerehabilitation or centre‐based rehabilitation. REMOTE‐CR provided individualised exercise prescription, real‐time exercise monitoring/coaching and theory‐based behavioural strategies via a bespoke telerehabilitation platform; CBexCR provided individualised exercise prescription and coaching via established rehabilitation clinics. Outcomes assessed at baseline, 12 and/or 24 weeks included maximal oxygen uptake (V ‡O2max, primary) modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, exercise adherence, motivation, health‐related quality of life and programme delivery, hospital service utilisation and medication costs. The primary hypothesis was a non‐inferior between‐group difference in V ‡O2max at 12 weeks (inferiority margin=1.25 mL/kg/min); inferiority margins were not set for secondary outcomes. Results: 162 participants (mean 61±12.7 years, 86% men) were randomised. V ‡O2 max was comparable in both groups at 12 weeks and REMOTE‐CR was non‐inferior to CBexCR (REMOTE‐CR‐CBexCR adjusted mean difference (AMD)=0.51 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.98) mL/kg/min, p=0.48). REMOTE‐CR participants were less sedentary at 24 weeks (AMD=61.5 (95% CI 117.8 to 5.3) min/day, p=0.03), while CBexCR participants had smaller waist (AMD=1.71 (95% CI 0.09 to 3.34) cm, p=0.04) and hip circumferences (AMD=1.16 (95% CI 0.06 to 2.27) cm, p=0.04) at 12 weeks. No other between‐group differences were detected. Per capita programme delivery (NZD1130/GBP573 vs NZD3466/GBP1758) and medication costs (NZD331/GBP168 vs NZD605/GBP307, p=0.02) were lower for REMOTE‐CR. Hospital service utilisation costs were not statistically significantly different (NZD3459/GBP1754 vs NZD5464/GBP2771, p=0.20). Conclusion: REMOTE‐CR is an effective, cost‐efficient alternative delivery model that could ‐ as a complement to existing services ‐ improve overall utilisation rates by increasing reach and satisfying unique participant preferences.

DOI: 10.1177/2050640618792819
AB: Introduction: Value‐based care is a promising strategy to improve quality of care and control costs, but warrants systematic measurement of patient‐reported outcomes. Telemedicine is a powerful tool to enable continuous monitoring of outcomes in chronic diseases. For inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), implementation of telemedicine previously showed to reduce outpatient visits and hospital admissions (1). However, cost‐utility analyses are lacking. We therefore evaluated the incremental cost‐utility of telemedicine versus standard care for IBD patients. Aims and Methods: We used data from the 12‐month myIBDcoach trial in which 909 IBD patients were randomized to telemedicine (n=465) or standard care (n=444). Direct healthcare costs were estimated based on resource use multiplied by the appropriate unit prices, indirect or productivity costs were calculated using the friction‐cost method, a license fee of €40 was calculated for patients using telemedicine, and utilities were assessed using EQ5D (Dutch tariff). Costutility and uncertainty were estimated using the non‐parametric bootstrapping method. Results: Telemedicine resulted in a mean yearly cost saving of ‐€554 per patient (95%CI, [€‐987, €2,094]; mean costs of €9495 for standard care and €8941 for telemedicine) and was associated with a small mean gain in quality adjusted life years (QALY) of 0.002 (95%CI, [‐0.022, 0.018]). As myIBDcoach results on average in lower costs and somewhat better health, overall this innovative intervention dominates usual care. Telemedicine was cost‐reducing in 76% of the replications. However, there is still uncertainty, as dominance occurs only in 57% of the replications (figure 1). Conclusion: Telemedicine with myIBDcoach is on average cost‐reducing compared to standard care with maintained quality of life. However, there is large uncertainty and it might be of interest to detect whether a subgroup can be identified in which use of myIBDcoach results in higher QALY without higher costs. Trials with longer follow‐up are required to determine whether telemedicine can improve quality of life and disease outcomes on the long term.

AB: Background: Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in children (IPTc) involves the administration of a course of anti‐malarial drugs at specified time intervals to children at risk of malaria regardless of whether or not they are known to be infected. IPTc provides a high level of protection against uncomplicated and severe malaria, with monthly sulphadoxine‐pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP&AQ) and sulphadoxine‐pyrimethamine plus piperaquine being the most efficacious regimens. A key challenge is the identification of a cost‐effective delivery strategy. Methods: A community randomized trial was undertaken in Jasikan district, Ghana to assess IPTc effectiveness and costs using SP&AQ delivered in three different ways. Twelve villages were randomly selected to receive IPTc from village health workers (VHWs) or facility‐based nurses working at health centres' outpatient departments (OPD) or EPI outreach clinics. Children aged 3 to 59 months‐old received one IPT course (three doses) in May, June, September and October. Effectiveness was measured in terms of children covered and adherent to a course and delivery costs were calculated in financial and economic terms using an ingredient approach from the provider perspective. Results: The economic cost per child receiving at least the first dose of all 4 courses was US$4.58 when IPTc was delivered by VHWs, US$4.93 by OPD nurses and US$ 5.65 by EPI nurses. The unit economic cost of receiving all 3 doses of all 4 courses was US$7.56 and US$8.51 when IPTc was delivered by VHWs or facility‐based nurses respectively. The main cost driver for the VHW delivery was supervision, reflecting resources used for travelling to more remote communities rather than more intense supervision, and for OPD and EPI delivery, it was the opportunity cost of the time spent by nurses in dispensing IPTc. Conclusions: VHWs achieve higher IPTc coverage and adherence at lower costs than facility‐based nurses in Jasikan district, Ghana.

AB: Our objective was to measure direct (hospital and NHS) and indirect (patient/caregiver) costs of following up in‐home compliance to non‐invasive ventilation via wireless modem. We constructed a prospective controlled trial of 40 consecutive ALS home‐ventilated patients, randomly assigned according to their residence area to G1 (nearby hospital, office‐based follow‐up) and G2 (outside hospital area, telemetry device‐based follow‐up). Total NHS direct cost encompassed costs related to outpatients' visits (office and emergency room) and hospitalizations. Hospital direct costs included transportation to/from hospital, office visit per hour cost and equipment maintenance. Non‐medical costs considered days of wages lost due to absenteeism. G1 included 20 patients aged 60 ± 10 years and G2 included 19 patients aged 62 ± 13 years. Results showed that no differences were found regarding clinical/demographic characteristics at admission. NHS costs showed a 55% reduction in average total costs with a statistically significant decrease of 81% in annual costs per patient in G2. Hospital costs were found to be significantly higher in G2 with regard to total costs (64% average increase) but not annual costs (7%). No statistical difference was found with regard to expenses from absenteeism. In conclusion, at the cost of an initial financial constraint to the hospital per year (non‐significant), telemonitoring is cost‐effective, representing major cost savings to the NHS in the order of 700 euros/patient/year.

AB: Background: This study assessed the costs and cost‐efficiency of a mobile cash transfer implemented in Tapoa Province, Burkina Faso in the MAM'Out randomized controlled trial from June 2013 to December 2014, using mixed methods and taking a societal perspective by including costs to implementing partners and beneficiary households. Methods: Data were collected via interviews with implementing staff from the humanitarian agency and the private partner delivering the mobile money, focus group discussions with beneficiaries, and review of accounting databases. Costs were analyzed by input category and activity‐based cost centers. cost‐efficiency was analyzed by cost‐transfer ratios (CTR) and cost per beneficiary. Qualitative analysis was conducted to identify themes related to implementing electronic cash transfers, and barriers to efficient implementation. Results: The CTR was 0.82 from a societal perspective, within the same range as other humanitarian transfer programs; however the intervention did not achieve the same degree of cost‐efficiency as other mobile transfer programs specifically. Challenges in coordination between humanitarian and private partners resulted in long wait times for beneficiaries, particularly in the first year of implementation. Sensitivity analyses indicated a potential 6% reduction in CTR through reducing beneficiary wait time by one‐half. Actors reported that coordination challenges improved during the project, therefore inefficiencies likely would be resolved, and cost‐efficiency improved, as the program passed the pilot phase. Conclusions: Despite the time required to establish trusting relationships among actors, and to set up a network of cash points in remote areas, this analysis showed that mobile transfers hold promise as a cost‐efficient method of delivering cash in this setting. Implementation by local government would likely reduce costs greatly compared to those found in this study context, and improve cost‐efficiency especially by subsidizing expansion of mobile money network coverage and increasing cash distribution points in remote areas which are unprofitable for private partners.

AB: An evaluation was undertaken on the effectiveness and efficiency of care coordination as a means of delivering health services to Australian veterans with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure. The veterans participated in a randomized controlled trial of care coordination that was supported by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). Of 490 veterans who were recruited, 409 were surveyed at baseline (214 in the intervention group and 195 controls). At follow‐up, 288 were surveyed (155 intervention and 133 controls). Information on cost of care and quality of life (QOL) was collected before the commencement of coordinated care and at follow‐up after 12 months. Cost of care data were obtained from DVA records. Information on QOL was obtained from telephone interviews, using the Short Form (SF‐12) Health Survey and the EuroQol Group EQ‐5D survey. There were no significant differences in costs of care between the intervention (coordinated care) and control groups of veterans. Nor were there significant differences between the intervention and control groups in QOL measurements with either of the evaluation tools that were used. Because evidence of benefit from coordinated care may be slow to emerge in patients with chronic disease, it would be desirable for future work in this area to include long term, good quality comparative studies on selected veteran populations. Such studies should measure QOL and economic outcomes in addition to clinical indicators.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of a telephonic disease management (DM) intervention in heart failure (HF). STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of telephonic DM among 1069 community‐dwelling patients with systolic HF (SHF) and diastolic HF performed between 1999 and 2003. The enrollment period was 18 months per subject. METHODS: Bootstrap‐resampled incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were computed and compared across groups. Direct medical costs were obtained from a medical record review that collected records from 92% of patients; 66% of records requested were obtained. RESULTS: Disease management produced statistically significant survival advantages among all patients (17.4 days, P = .04), among patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III/IV symptoms (47.7 days, P = .02), and among patients with SHF (24.2 days, P = .01). Analyses of direct medical and intervention costs showed no cost savings associated with the intervention. For all patients and considering all‐cause medical care, the ICER was $146 870 per quality‐adjusted life‐year (QALY) gained, while for patients with NYHA class III/IV symptoms and patients with SHF, the ICERs were $67 784 and $95 721 per QALY gained, respectively. Costs per QALY gained were $101 120 for all patients, $72 501 for patients with SHF, and $41 348 for patients with NYHA class III/IV symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was effective but costly to implement and did not reduce utilization. It may not be cost‐effective in other broadly representative samples of patients. However, with program cost reductions and proper targeting, this program may produce life‐span increases at costs that are less than $100 000 per QALY gained.

AB: Background: The randomized ECOST study demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of long‐term remote monitoring (RM) of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). Beside these obvious benefits, it was necessary to question the economic aspects of RM. We compared the long term costs of RM with those of ambulatory follow‐up. Methods: ECOST randomly assigned 433 patients to RM (Biotronik Home Monitoring) (active group) vs. ambulatory follow‐ups (control group). Patients assigned to active group were seen once a year unless the RM system reported an ICD dysfunction or a clinical event mandating an ambulatory visit, while patients assigned to control group underwent ambulatory visits every 6 months. The economic analysis included 310 patients. The individual costs associated with each follow‐up strategy were compared using the actual billing documents issued by the French national health insurance system, including 1) costs of cardiovascular hospitalizations and 2) non‐hospital costs related to device management (ICD‐related ambulatory visits and associated transports), cardiovascular procedures drugs and other ambulatory visits. The ICD and RM system costs were evaluated based on the remaining longevity of the device at the end of study Results: The characteristics of the study groups were similar. Over a follow‐up of 27 months, the hospitalization costs per patient‐year were not different (2,829+/‐6,382 in the active vs. 3,549+/‐9,714 in the control group, p=0.46) The non‐hospital costs were respectively 1,695+/‐1,131 vs. 1,952+/‐1,023 per patient‐year, a 257 cost‐saving in the active group (p=0.04), difference mainly due to the device management. Adding the ICD costs to non‐hospital costs, the cost‐saving in the active group was 494 per patient‐year (p=0.005) or 315 if the Home Monitoring system costs are included (p=0.05). Conclusion: RM generates, from the perspective of health insurance, savings on the budget post of care which includes ambulatory care and devices, without affecting the cost of hospital care. This analysis did not take into account the remuneration of physicians for the acts of telemedicine, which is not yet supported in France. After having proven its safety and its clinical efficacy, the remote monitoring of ICDs has proven its cost efficiency.

AB: We conducted a cost benefit analysis of a home telehealth‐based cardiac rehabilitation programme compared to the standard hospital‐based programme. A total of 120 participants were enrolled in a trial, with 60 randomised to the telehealth group and 60 randomised to usual care. Participants in the telehealth group received a mobile phone, Wellness Diary and a Wellness web portal, with daily text messaging. Participants in the usual care group received the standard 6‐week hospital‐based outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programme, including gym sessions. The cost of delivery by telehealth was slightly lower than for patients attending a rehabilitation service in person. From the provider's perspective, the telehealth intervention could be delivered for $1633 per patient, compared to $1845 for the usual care group. From the participant's perspective, patient travel costs for home rehabilitation were substantially less than for hospital attendance ($80 vs $400). Cardiac rehabilitation by telehealth offers obvious advantages and the option should be available to all patients who are eligible for cardiac rehabilitation.

DOI: 10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0941
AB: Shared decision making is an approach to care that seeks to fully inform patients about the risks and benefits of available treatments and engage them as participants in decisions about the treatments. Although recent federal and state policies pursue the expanded use of shared decision making as a way to improve care quality and patient experience, payers and providers want evidence that this emerging model of care is cost‐effective. We examined data obtained from a year‐long randomized investigation. The study compared the effects on patients of receiving a usual level of support in making a medical treatment decision with the effects of receiving enhanced support, which included more contact with trained health coaches through telephone, mail, e‐mail, and the Internet. We found that patients who received enhanced support had 5.3 percent lower overall medical costs than patients who received the usual level of support. The enhanced‐support group had 12.5 percent fewer hospital admissions than the usual‐support group, and 9.9 percent fewer preference‐sensitive surgeries, including 20.9 percent fewer preference‐sensitive heart surgeries. These findings indicate that support for shared decision making can generate savings. They also suggest that a "remote" model of support‐combining telephonic coaching with decision aids, for example‐may constitute a relatively low‐cost and effective intervention that could reach broader populations without the need for the direct involvement of regular medical care team members.

AB: Objectives: To measure the costs of two pilot interventions within the National Institutes of Health‐funded Centers for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) designed to improve health outcomes in medically underserved commuestimates nities through the utilization of allied health professionals. Methods: Two local CPHHD programs with prospective randomized controlled trial designs (a virtual team care intervention aimed at reducing depressive symptoms in older adults with depression and cardio‐metabolic syndrome, and a patient navigator program to increase mammography screening for breast cancer) provided the underlying data for this analysis. The programs collected detailed resource use data along with several clinical measures. Costs were measured from a payer perspective. The navigator program involved in‐person or remote navigator consultations, and costs were based on a wage rate of $15 per hour. The depression program involved multiple services and all costs reflected institution‐specific billing data. Results: There were 949 patients in the patient navigator intervention. On average, these patients received 8.28 minutes of navigator services per patient over the phone and 1.23 minutes via in‐person visits, translating to a per‐patient cost of $2.38. For the six patients enrolled in the team care intervention for depression, resources used included social worker case management and individual psychotherapy, translating to program costs of $145 per patient over 12 months. Spillover health care service costs were similar between the intervention and control groups (intervention = $55 per patient, control = $64 per patient). Conclusions: Costs are an important consideration for evaluating pilot, team‐care based interventions to improve patient health. The two programs evaluated here offer insight into the potential impact of interventions that employ allied health professionals and demonstrate a relatively low cost per patient. Future work will examine these costs in comparison with measured effects of the program.

AB: Clinical trials are critical for medical decision‐making, however, under the current paradigm, clinical trials are fraught with problems including low enrollment and high cost. Promising alternatives to increase trial efficiency and reduce costs include the use of (1) electronic initiatives that permit electronic remote data capture (EDC) for direct data collection at a site (2), electronic medical records (EMR) for patient identification and data collection, and (3) adaptive, enrichment designs with pragmatic approaches. We describe the design of a seamless, multi‐site randomized Phase II/III trial to evaluate an asthma management intervention in urban adolescents with asthma. Patients are randomized, asked to access four online sessions of the intervention or control asthma management program, and are then followed for one year. The primary efficacy endpoint is self‐reported asthma control as measured by the Asthma Control Test (ACT). Comparative effectiveness parametric approaches are utilized to conduct the trial in a real world setting with reduced costs. Escalated electronic initiatives are implemented for patient identification, assent, enrollment and tracking. Patient enrollment takes place during primary care visits. A centralized database with EDC is used for CRF data collection with integration of EMR data. This Phase II/III trial plans to have a total sample size of 500 patients with an interim look at the completion of Phase II (n=250), The interim analyses include an assessment of the intervention effect, marker(s) identification and the feasibility study of EMR data as the trial CRF data collection. Patient enrollment has begun and is ongoing.

AB: Background: The randomized ECOST study confirmed the safety and effectiveness of long‐term remote monitoring (RM) of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). We compared the overall costs of RM with those of ambulatory follow‐up (AFU) on the long term. Methods: ECOST randomly assigned 433 ICD recipients to RM versus AFU. Patients assigned to RM were seen once a year unless the system reported an ICD dysfunction or a clinical event mandating an ambulatory visit. Patients assigned to AFU were seen in the ambulatory department every 6 months. This analysis included 310 patients. Instead of using the expected costs based on a theorical act schedule, we calculated and compared the long‐term individual costs associated with each follow‐up strategy, using the actual billing documents issued by the French national health insurance system, including 1) costs of non‐hospital care (all cardiovascular procedures, all ICD‐related or unrelated ambulatory visits and ICD associated transportation costs) and 2) costs of hospitalizations for management of cardiovascular disorders. Results: The characteristics of the study groups were similar. Over a follow‐up of 27 months, the mean costs (+/‐ standard deviation) of non‐hospital care were 568 +/‐ 349 per patient‐year in the RM, versus 712 +/‐ 414 per patient‐year in the AFU group, a 144 per patient‐year (20%) cost saving (p<0.001). The mean costs of hospitalizations per patient‐year for management of cardiovascular disorders in the RM (2,829 +/‐ 6,382) versus the AFU (3,549 +/‐ 9,714) group were similar. Conclusions: In this initial randomized comparison, which did not include the costs of the RM system and of ICD, the costs of non‐hospital, longterm RM of ICD were significantly lower than the costs of AFU.

AB: Further evidence is needed on the potential clinical benefits and cost‐effectiveness of remote patient care for the management of COPD. PROMETE II is a multicentre, randomized controlled trial lasting 12‐months conducted in five hospitals in Madrid, Spain. COPD patients in stable condition (6 weeks without a COPD exacerbation) were randomized to either telehealth (TH) or routine clinical practice (RCP), The main objective was to reduce the number of COPD exacerbations leading to ER visits/hospital admissions. Overall, 237 COPD patients were recruited, and 229 (96.6%) were randomized to either TH (n=115) or RCP (n=114). Participants had a mean±SD age of 71±8 years and 80% were men. There were no statistically significant differences in the primary efficacy analysis of the proportion of participants who had a severe COPD exacerbation leading to ER visits or a hospital admission (59.5% in TH vs. 55.7% in RCP; p=0.556). Similarly, the mean number of exacerbations over the 12‐month period was comparable between groups, 1.0 in TH vs. 0.9 in RCP (p=0.286). However, there was a non‐significant trend towards a shorter mean total duration of hospitalization in the TH group (18.9±16.4 days) compared to the RCP group (22.3±19.7 days), p=0.353, and of fewer days in the ICU, 6.0±4.6 vs.13.3±11.1 days, p=0.349. At month 12, the number of all‐cause deaths was comparable between groups (11 in TH vs. 13 in RCP). Lastly, telehealth was evaluated highly positively by both participating physicians and patients. We conclude that remote patient management did not reduce the COPD‐related ER visits or hospital admissions compared to routine clinical care within 12 months.

AB: Aims: To determine if an intensified form of heart failure management programme (INT‐HF‐MP) based on individual profiling is superior to standard management (SM) in reducing health care costs during 12‐month follow‐up (primary endpoint). Methods and results: A multicentre randomized trial involving 787 patients (full analysis set) discharged from four tertiary hospitals with chronic HF who were randomized to SM (n = 391) or INT‐HF‐MP (n = 396). Mean age was 74 ± 12 years, 65% had HF with a reduced ejection fraction (31.4 ± 8.9%) and 14% were remote‐dwelling. Study groups were well matched. According to Green, Amber, Red Delineation of rIsk And Need in HF (GARDIAN‐HF) profiling, regardless of location, patients in the INT‐HF‐MP received a combination of face‐to‐face (home visits) and structured telephone support (STS); only 9% (`low risk') were designated to receive the same level of management as the SM group. The median cost in 2017 Australian dollars (A$1 equivalent to ∼EUR €0.7) of applying INT‐HF‐MP was significantly greater than SM ($152 vs. $121 per patient per month; P < 0.001), However, at 12 months, there was no difference in total health care costs for the INT‐HF‐MP vs. SM group (median $1579, IQR $644 to $3717 vs. $1450, IQR $564 to $3615 per patient per month, respectively). This reflected minimal differences in all‐cause mortality (17.7% vs. 18.4%; P = 0.848) and recurrent hospital stay (18.6 ± 26.5 vs. 16.6 ± 24.8 days; P = 0.199) between the INT‐HF‐MP and SM groups, respectively. Conclusion: During 12‐months follow‐up, an INT‐HF‐MP did not reduce healthcare costs or improve health outcomes relative to SM.

AB: Introduction Telemonitoring of patients with implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICD) is, in general, considered safer, more efficious, and increasingly cost‐effective. The aim of our work was to assess the long‐Term economic benefit associated with telemetric monitoring of patients with newly implanted ICD using the Home MonitoringTM (HM) system compared to standard outpatient care in the Czech Republic. Methods Patients were randomized to telemetric monitoring using the HM system with daily automated data transfer and outpatient follow‐up at 12‐month intervals (HM+) or standard outpatient follow‐up (HM‐). Average total costs per patient and months of follow‐up were estimated based on invoices from health insurance companies, direct costs to patients, and the operating costs of the HM system. Results In total, 198 patients were followed for 37.4 +/‐ 15.2 months. The number of planned outpatient visits was reduced by 48% during the follow‐up period in the HM+ group (p < 0.001). Significantly shorter hospital stays were also observed in the HM+ group. Data concerning costs were obtained in 75% of patients. Higher costs for outpatient care (223 +/‐ 99 CZK vs. 189 +/‐ 93 CZK, p = 0.039) and medical transport services (640 +/‐ 314 CZK vs. 367 +/‐ 187 CZK, p = 0.003) were found in the HM‐group. When taking into account the operating costs of the HM system in addition to the costs for outpatient care and transport, the difference between groups was not significant; however, when the reimbursement of telemetric monitoring and costs for the patient unit were also reflected in the calculations, the average cost in the HM+ group was higher (541 +/‐ 188 CZK vs. 401 +/‐ 332 CZK, p = 0.002). Cost‐neutrality could be obtained if all patients were transported free of charge to their outpatient visits. Conclusion In the Czech Republic, the HM system has been cost‐effective for health insurance companies in patients with single‐or dual‐chamber ICDs. When calculating using the reimbursement from payers of the healthcare, the HM system would remain cost‐neutral only if most patients had reimbursed transportation costs. The clinical effect of telemetric monitoring is directly related to the continuity of follow‐up and the possibility to detect events very early and to intervene accordingly; we thus believe that the HM system should be automatically paid for in all patients with an implantable ICD. The related increase in costs would be insignificant in the context of the entire healthcare budget. Copyright © 2015 The Czech Society of Cardiology.

AB: BACKGROUND: For economic reasons, i.e., to reduce costs of in‐hospital patient accommodations, constant pressure has been applied in recent years to increase the percentage of ambulatory surgeries. Effective control of post‐operative pain after ambulatory surgery is challenging to all health professionals. Computerised systems are being implemented more frequently for remote patient monitoring, including during the at‐home post‐operative period. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the feasibility of delivering a computerised system, developed in‐house, for remote pain monitoring. It evaluates the user‐friendliness of the system and the extent of patient compliance. Finally, a comparative assessment of the system is made with respect to the quality of pain treatment in ambulatory surgery. METHODS: The participants included 32 adults, aged 18‐75, randomly assigned to a control group or to a computerised treatment group. The primary treatment outcome was measured by pain intensity ratings (0‐10 NRS) reported several times per day during a five‐day monitoring period, using an electronic pain diary combined with a web‐based personal health record. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated the feasibility and suitability of the proposed system for pain management. Its handling was user‐friendly, without requiring advanced skill or prior experience. In addition, the results showed that the guidance of health care professionals is essential to patients' satisfaction and positive experience with the system. There were no significant group differences with respect to improvements in the quality of pain treatment; however, this can be explained by the low pain scores registered in both groups, related to the type of surgical interventions recruited and the degrees of pain that are easily treated. To evaluate the benefits from a patient‐centred perspective, studies of major ambulatory surgeries or of patients in chronic pain, including oncologic and non‐oncologic pain resistant to treatment, are necessary.

AB: Background: Technology‐assisted case management (TACM) with medication titration by nurses under physician supervision was shown to be more effective in improving glycemic control and provide a faster rate of decline in levels of HbA1c compared to usual care in low‐income rural adults with poorly controlled diabetes. To support implementation in resource poor settings, we conducted a cost analysis to examine whether the intervention was cost‐effective compared to usual care. Methods: This was a randomized, controlled trial with participants assigned to control or an intervention involving a telehealth device and a nurse case manager trained to titrate medications every 2 weeks based on an algorithm. The primary outcome was glycemic control (HbA1c) at 6‐months post‐randomization. Costs were measured using respondents' answers about healthcare utilization prior to and during the intervention. Costs were estimated based on Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) medical expenditure averages for each utilization type. Costs for lost wages were estimate using interval regression and using the fitted values to estimate the cost lost days of work due to illness. All costs were adjusted to 2012 levels using Consumer Price Index (CPI) conversions. Effectiveness was measured as HbA1c calculated via area under the curve. The total costs and HbA1c were used to estimate a joint distribution of incremental costs and incremental effects as well as cost effectiveness acceptability curves. Results were generated using a non‐parametrically bootstrapped sample of 1000 to provide confidence intervals. Results: Average total costs for the intervention group ($ 4,882.80, σ = 7,845.86) were higher than the usual care group ($ 1,247.03, σ = 1,547.83). However, the decrease in HbA1c was larger in the TACM group (‐0.978, σ = 2.063) than the usual care group (‐0.2659, σ = 2.166). The corresponding incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated to be $ 5948.14. Conclusions: Though the intervention costs were higher relative to usual care, low‐income individuals receiving technology‐assisted case management with medication titration had significantly higher drops in glycemic control, with a corresponding ICER indicating approximately $ 6,000 per 1% decrease in HbA1c. Given the growing costs of uncontrolled diabetes both in terms of medical costs and productivity loss, this intervention can be deployed in low resource settings to improve outcomes for low‐income individuals with diabetes.

AB: Background and Purpose: Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy is an effective but expensive therapy for acute ischemic stroke with proximal anterior circulation occlusion. This study aimed to determine the cost‐effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy in China, the largest developing country. Methods: A combination of decision tree and Markov model was developed to determine the cost‐effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours with IV tPA treatment within 4.5 hours versus IV tPA treatment alone. Outcomes and costs data were derived from the published literature and claims database. Efficacy data were derived from the patient‐level pooled analyses of the 5 trials in 2015. Benefit was assessed by calculating the cost per quality‐adjusted life‐year (QALY) gained in the long term (30 years). One‐way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty of the results. Results: The addition of mechanical thrombectomy compared with standard treatment alone yielded a lifetime gain of 0.934 QALYs at an additional cost of CNY 61,760 (US$ 9,500), resulting in a cost of CNY 66,100 (US$ 10,170) per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that mechanical thrombectomy is cost‐effective in 91.9% of the simulation runs at a willingness‐to‐pay threshold of CNY 125,700 (US$ 19,300) per QALY. Conclusions: Mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke caused by proximal anterior circulation occlusion within 6 hours was cost‐effective in China. This may be a reference to medical resources allocation for stroke treatment in low‐ and middle‐income countries and the remote areas in the developing countries.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of using a 'virtual clinic' on patient experience and cost in the care of women with urinary incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women, aged > 18 years referred to a urogynaecology unit were randomised to either (1) A Standard Clinic or (2) A Virtual Clinic. Both groups completed a validated, web‐based interactive, patient‐reported outome measure (ePAQ‐Pelvic Floor), in advance of their appointment followed by either a telephone consultation (Virtual Clinic) or face‐to‐face consultation (Standard Care). The primary outcome was the mean 'short‐term outcome scale' score on the Patient Experience Questionnaire (PEQ). Secondary Outcome Measures included the other domains of the PEQ (Communications, Emotions and Barriers), Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ), Short‐Form 12 (SF‐12), personal, societal and NHS costs. RESULTS: 195 women were randomised: 98 received the intervention and 97 received standard care. The primary outcome showed a non‐significant difference between the two study arms. No significant differences were also observed on the CSQ and SF‐12. However, the intervention group showed significantly higher PEQ domain scores for Communications, Emotions and Barriers (including following adjustment for age and parity). Whilst standard care was overall more cost‐effective, this was minimal (£38.04). The virtual clinic also significantly reduced consultation time (10.94 minutes, compared with a mean duration of 25.9 minutes respectively) and consultation costs compared to usual care (£31.75 versus £72.17 respectively), thus presenting potential cost‐savings in out‐patient management. CONCLUSIONS: The virtual clinical had no impact on the short‐term dimension of the PEQ and overall was not as cost‐effective as standard care, due to greater clinic re‐attendances in this group. In the virtual clinic group, consultation times were briefer, communication experience was enhanced and personal costs lower. For medical conditions of a sensitive or intimate nature, a virtual clinic has potential to support patients to communicate with health professionals about their condition.

AB: Objective To determine whether a diabetes case management telemedicine intervention reduced healthcare expenditures, as measured by Medicare claims, and to assess the costs of developing and implementing the telemedicine intervention. Design We studied 1665 participants in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel), a randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine case management of diabetes to usual care. Participants were aged 55 years or older, and resided in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. Measurements We analyzed Medicare claims payments for each participant for up to 60 study months from date of randomization, until their death, or until December 31, 2006 (whichever happened first). We also analyzed study expenditures for the telemedicine intervention over six budget years (February 28, 2000‐ February 27, 2006). Results Mean annual Medicare payments (SE) were similar in the usual care and telemedicine groups, $9040 ($386) and $9669 ($443) per participant, respectively (p>0.05). Sensitivity analyses, including stratification by censored status, adjustment by enrollment site, and semi‐parametric weighting by probability of dropping‐out, rendered similar results. Over six budget years 28 821 participant/months of telemedicine intervention were delivered, at an estimated cost of $622 per participant/month. Conclusion Telemedicine case management was not associated with a reduction in Medicare claims in this medically underserved population. The cost of implementing the telemedicine intervention was high, largely representing special purpose hardware and software costs required at the time. Lower implementation costs will need to be achieved using lower cost technology in order for telemedicine case management to be more widely used.

AB: We studied whether preventive home monitoring of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could reduce the frequency of hospital admissions and lower the cost of hospitalization. Patients were recruited from a health centre, general practitioner (GP) or the pulmonary hospital ward. They were randomized to usual care or tele‐rehabilitation with a telehealth monitoring device installed in their home for four months. A total of 111 patients were suitable for inclusion and consented to be randomized: 60 patients were allocated to intervention and three were lost to follow‐up. In the control group 51 patients were allocated to usual care and three patients were lost to follow‐up. In the tele‐rehabilitation group, the mean hospital admission rate was 0.49 per patient per 10 months compared to the control group rate of 1.17; this difference was significant (P = 0.041). The mean cost of admissions was €3461 per patient in the intervention group and €4576 in the control group; this difference was not significant. The Kaplan‐Meier estimates for time to hospital admission were longer for the intervention group than the controls, but the difference was not significant. Future work requires large‐scale studies of prolonged home monitoring with more extended follow‐up.

AB: The replacement of implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICDs) may give rise to considerable clinical consequences, the importance of which is underrated by the medical community. Replacement‐related adverse events are difficult to identify and require monitoring of both short‐term complications and long‐term patient outcome. The aim of this study is to perform a structured evaluation of both short‐ and long‐term adverse events and a cost analysis of consecutive ICD replacement procedures. Detect Long‐term Complications After ICD Replacement (DECODE) is a prospective, single‐arm, multicenter cohort study designed to estimate long‐term complication rates (at 12 months and 5 years) in patients undergoing ICD generator replacement. The study will also evaluate predictors of complications, patient management before and during the replacement procedure in clinical practice, and the costs related to use of health care resources. About 800 consecutive patients with standard indications for ICD generator replacement will be enrolled in this study. The decision to undertake generator replacement/upgrade will be made according to the investigators' own judgment (which will be recorded). Patients will be followed for 60 months through periodic in‐hospital examinations or remote monitoring. Detailed data on complications related to ICD replacement in current clinical practice are still lacking. The analysis of adverse events will reveal the value of new preventive strategies, thereby yielding both clinical and economic benefits. Moreover, assessment of complication rates after ICD replacement in a real‐life setting will help estimate the actual long‐term cost of ICD therapy and assess the real impact of increasing ICD longevity on cost‐effectiveness.

AB: The aim of this study was to perform a cost minimization analysis of store‐and‐forward teledermatology compared to a conventional dermatology referral process (usual care). In a Department of Defense (DoD) setting, subjects were randomized to either a teledermatology consult or usual care. Accrued healthcare utilization recorded over a 4‐month period included clinic visits, teledermatology visits, laboratories, preparations, procedures, radiological tests, and medications. Direct medical care costs were estimated by combining utilization data with Medicare reimbursement rates and wholesale drug prices. The indirect cost of productivity loss for seeking treatment was also included in the analysis using an average labor rate. Total and average costs were compared between groups. Teledermatology patients incurred $103,043 in total direct costs ($294 average), while usual‐care patients incurred $98,365 ($283 average). However, teledermatology patients only incurred $16,359 ($47 average) in lost productivity cost while usual‐care patients incurred $30,768 ($89 average). In total, teledermatology patients incurred $119,402 ($340 average) and usual‐care patients incurred $129,133 ($372 average) in costs. From the economic perspective of the DoD, store‐and‐forward teledermatology was a cost‐saving strategy for delivering dermatology care compared to conventional consultation methods when productivity loss cost is taken into consideration.

AB: OBJECTIVE: The study examined the cost‐effectiveness of a telemedicine‐based collaborative care model designed to increase rural veterans' engagement in evidence‐based treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: The Telemedicine Outreach for PTSD (TOP) study used a pragmatic randomized effectiveness trial to examine effects of PTSD care teams located at Veterans Affairs medical centers and supporting primary care providers in satellite clinics. Teams included a nurse care manager, pharmacist, psychologist, and psychiatrist. Effectiveness was estimated with quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the Short Form Health Survey for Veterans and Quality of Well‐Being (QWB) scale. Intervention and health care costs were collected to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of the intervention. RESULTS: The sample (N=265) included mostly rural, unemployed, middle‐aged men with a military service‐connected disability for PTSD randomly assigned to TOP or usual care. Only minor improvements in QWB QALYs were found. The TOP intervention was relatively expensive, with costs totaling $2,029 per patient per year. Intervention costs were not offset by reductions in health care utilization costs, resulting in an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio of $185,565 per QALY (interquartile range $57,675 to $395,743). CONCLUSIONS: Because of the upfront training costs and the resource‐intensive nature of this intervention, associated expenses were high. Although PTSD‐specific effectiveness measures were significantly improved, these changes did not translate to QALYs in the main analysis. However, analyses focusing on patient subgroups with comorbid mental disorders indicated greater QALY improvement for TOP at lower cost.

AB: Background Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (cCBT) has been developed as an efficient form of therapy delivery with the potential to enhance access to psychological care. Independent research is needed which examines both the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of cCBT over the short and longer term. Objectives To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of cCBT as an adjunct to usual general practitioner (GP) care against usual GP care alone, for a free‐to‐use cCBT program (MoodGYM; National Institute for Mental Health Research, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia) and a commercial pay‐to‐use cCBT program (Beating the Blues; Ultrasis, London, UK) for adults with depression, and to determine the acceptability of cCBT and the experiences of users. Design A pragmatic, multicentre, three‐armed, parallel, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with concurrent economic and qualitative evaluations. Simple randomisation was used. Participants and researchers were not blind to treatment allocation. Setting Primary care in England. Participants Adults with depression who scored >10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9). Interventions Participants who were randomised to either of the two intervention groups received cCBT (Beating the Blues or MoodGYM) in addition to usual GP care. Participants who were randomised to the control group were offered usual GP care. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was depression at 4 months (PHQ‐9). Secondary outcomes were depression at 12 and 24 months; measures of mental health and health‐related quality of life at 4, 12 and 24 months; treatment preference; and the acceptability of cCBT and experiences of users. Results Clinical effectiveness: 210 patients were randomised to Beating the Blues, 242 patients were randomised to MoodGYM and 239 patients were randomised to usual GP care (total 691). There was no difference in the primary outcome (depression measured at 4 months) either between Beating the Blues and usual GP care [odds ratio (OR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75 to 1.88] or between MoodGYM and usual GP care (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.56). There was no overall difference across all time points for either intervention compared with usual GP care in a mixed model (Beating the Blues versus usual GP care, p=0.96; and MoodGYM versus usual GP care, p=0.11). However, a small but statistically significant difference between MoodGYM and usual GP care at 12 months was found (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.93). Free‐to‐use cCBT (MoodGYM) was not inferior to pay‐to‐use cCBT (Beating the Blues) (OR 0.91, 90% CI 0.62 to 1.34; p=0.69). There were no consistent benefits of either intervention when secondary outcomes were examined. There were no serious adverse events thought likely to be related to the trial intervention. Despite the provision of regular technical telephone support, there was low uptake of the cCBT programs. Cost‐effectiveness: cost‐effectiveness analyses suggest that neither Beating the Blues nor MoodGYM appeared cost‐effective compared with usual GP care alone. Qualitative evaluation: participants were often demotivated to access the computer programs, by reason of depression. Some expressed the view that a greater level of therapeutic input would be needed to promote engagement. Conclusions The benefits that have previously been observed in developer‐led trials were not found in this large pragmatic RCT. The benefits of cCBT when added to routine primary care were minimal, and uptake of this mode of therapy was relatively low. There remains a clinical and economic need for effective low‐intensity psychological treatments for depression with improved patient engagement. Trial registration This trial is registered as ISRCTN91947481. Funding This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.

YR: 2014
KY: Pelvic Floor Disorders
AB: ePAQ is a web‐based interactive questionnaire (electronic pelvic floor assessment questionnaire) that provides a detailed evaluation of a woman's pelvic floor symptoms and their impact on her quality of life. Touch‐screen technology has been combined with computer programming (Dot Net & SQL Server) and existing paper‐based instruments to produce an interactive user‐friendly system that facilitates immediate data entry, analysis and storage. The instrument has evolved during several years' collaborative work with colleagues in a range of disciplines, including Gynaecology, Medical Physics, Colorectal Surgery, Urology and General Practice, as well as involving a women's health user‐group and regular surveys of patients' views.1 Research in primary and secondary care has established the psychometric properties of the instrument.2 The system has won a National award for innovation (HITEA) and was cited in Lord Warner's Annual Report on NHS Innovation.3 EPAQ Systems Ltd is one of the first NHS spin‐out technology companies to be established in the UK (created jointly with Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust in November 2006). More recent development work has resulted in the creation of a website, where subjects can securely and anonymously access and use the ePAQ system via the Internet. This potentially allows subjects to use system in advance of clinic appointments (as opposed to the current practice of their completing it on arrival in clinic, immediately prior to their appointment). This study aims to evaluate the impact that using ePAQ in this way may have on the efficiency and quality of patient care. Initial survey data suggest that many women attending urogynaecology clinics do have access to the Internet and would be willing to use the system on‐line & in advance of clinic appointments.4 The facility is also available in the Gynaecology Unit for women without Internet access to attend specifically for supervised use of the system. The in‐depth assessment provided by the ePAQ may then be used to support an initial telephone consultation with a clinician, following which patients may be directed to the most appropriate clinic, as well as being provided with information and advice and have some forms of treatment initiated (such as behavioural therapy). The proposed randomised study aims to compare outcomes in women who use the ePAQ system in this way with women who undergo standard care in the Urogynaecology Unit. The major advantage of electronic systems, when compared with paper questionnaires, relate to the practicalities of clinical data capture. Electronic questionnaires are comparable in terms of reliability and can be superior in terms of efficiency and response rate. In addition, electronic touch‐screen questionnaires have been shown to be acceptable to patients, regardless of their age or educational background. Data quality is high, even in disadvantaged and technophobic subjects and cost analysis has shown potential economic advantages.5,6,7,8,9 Pelvic floor disorders in women, such as incontinence and prolapse, share common aetiologies and commonly coexist. Estimates vary, though it is estimated that approximately 20% of adult women experience regular urinary incontinence, 5% have some incontinence of faeces and 11% suffer with prolapse.10,11,12 However, despite better understanding of these conditions, bowel, bladder, vaginal and sexual dysfunction remain understandably taboo subjects and many women still regard them as inevitable consequences of childbirth and ageing. The personal cost to individuals is high, however simple and effective treatments are increasingly available. Many disorders respond well to behavioural, physical or medical therapy and such conservative treatments are generally recommended prior to consideration of invasive investigations or surgery.13 In clinical practice, clinical assessment is central to diagnosis and management and the restoration of function, with a view to improving quality of life, is the principal aim of treatment. It is well recognised that clinical interview data may be unreliable, being based on clinicians' rather than patients' views of their condition. It seems appropriate therefore, to seek ways of improving clinical assessment in order to enhance the quality of care and reliably measure outcome. Many women with pelvic floor disorders are managed in the community by GPs, nurses, physiotherapists or continence nurse advisors. In secondary and tertiary care, urologists, gynaecologists, colorectal surgeons and geriatricians are likely to be involved. However, at all levels, inconsistencies in clinical assessments represent an impediment to effective communication and the multidisciplinary approach advocated by the DoH, who in 2000 recommended the following: ‐ Full assessment leading to first line treatment in the primary care setting, with treatment & management plans agreed with individual patients. ‐ The provision of an integrated continence service, bringing together agreed protocols and procedures for primary, secondary and tertiary care. ‐ A comprehensive continence service, at home and in homes, bringing together all relevant health disciplines. The further development of ePAQ has the potential to substantially augment this process by using on‐line assessments to support patients' initial management and triage. Using ePAQ in advance of clinic appointments may provide patients and clinicians with prompt and valuable information and assist in directing patients to the most appropriate clinics in primary and secondary care. However, such a development warrants scrutiny in terms of patient experience and cost. The ePAQ is now an established part of standard care and is in routine use in the Sheffield Urogynaecology Unit. All new patients are given the opportunity to complete the questionnaire, online, at home and their printed results are then used to inform the subsequent clinical consultation. The aims of this research are to measure the impact that using a virtual clinic (ePAQ‐PF in advance of clinic appointments + a telephone consultation) has on patient care and cost compared to standard care (ePAQ‐PF in advance of clinic appointments + a face to face consultation).

AB: BACKGROUND: Little evidence exists regarding the costs of telemedicine, especially considering changes over time. This analysis aimed to analyze trajectory of healthcare cost before, during, and after a behavioral activation intervention delivered via telepsychology and same‐room delivery to elderly Veterans with depression. METHODS: 241 participants were randomly assigned into one of two study groups: behavioral activation for depression via telemedicine or via same‐room treatment. Patients received 8 weeks of weekly 60‐min individual sessions of behavioral activation for depression. Primary outcomes were collected at 12‐months. Inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and total costs were collected from VA Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) datasets for FY 1998‐2014 and compared between the two treatment groups. Generalized mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories over time. RESULTS: Overall cost, as well as, outpatient and pharmacy cost show increasing trend over time. Unadjusted and adjusted trajectories over time for any cost were not different between the two treatment groups. There was a significant overall increasing trend over time for outpatient (p<0.001) and total cost (p<0.001) but not for inpatient (p=0.543) or pharmacy cost (p=0.084). LIMITATIONS: Generalizability to younger, healthier populations may be limited due to inclusion criteria for study participants. CONCLUSION: Healthcare costs before, during, and after intervention did not differ between the telemedicine and in‐person delivery methods. Outpatient costs accounted for most of the increasing trend of cost over time. These results support policies to use both telehealth and in‐person treatment modalities to effectively and efficiently provide high quality care.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Collaborative care is an effective approach for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression within the US Military Health System (MHS), but its cost‐effectiveness remains unstudied. Our objective was to evaluate the costs and cost‐effectiveness of centrally assisted collaborative telecare (CACT) versus optimized usual care (OUC) for PTSD and depression in the MHS. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized trial compared CACT with OUC. Routine primary care screening identified active‐duty service members with PTSD or depression. Eligible participants (N = 666) were randomized to CACT or OUC and assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months. OUC patients could receive care management and increased behavioral health support. CACT patients could receive these services plus stepped psychosocial treatment and routine centralized team monitoring. METHODS: Quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) were derived from the 12‐Item Short Form Health Survey. Claims and case management data were used to estimate costs. Cost‐effectiveness analyses were conducted from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Data from 629 patients (320 CACT and 309 OUC) with sufficient follow‐up were analyzed. CACT patients gained 0.02 QALYs (95% CI, –0.001 to 0.03) relative to OUC patients. Twelve‐month costs, including productivity, were $987 (95% CI, –$3056 to $5030) higher for CACT versus OUC. CACT was estimated to cost $49,346 per QALY gained compared with OUC over 12 months. There is a 58% probability that CACT is cost‐effective at a $100,000/QALY threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its higher costs, CACT appears to be a cost‐effective strategy relative to OUC for managing PTSD and depression in the MHS.

AB: CONTEXT: Effectiveness of organized depression care programs is well established, but dissemination will depend on the balance of benefits and costs. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the incremental benefit, incremental cost, and net benefit of 2 depression care programs. DESIGN: Randomized trial comparing 2 interventions with continued usual care, conducted between November 2000 and June 2004. SETTING: Seven primary care clinics of a prepaid health care plan in Washington. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive primary care patients starting antidepressant treatment were invited to a telephone assessment 2 weeks later. Of 634 patients with significant depressive symptoms, 600 consented and were randomized. INTERVENTIONS: The telephone care management intervention included up to 5 outreach calls for monitoring and support, feedback to treating physicians, and care coordination. The care management plus telephone psychotherapy intervention added an 8‐session structured cognitive behavioral therapy program with up to 4 additional calls for reinforcement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Independent, blinded telephone assessments at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months included the Symptom Checklist 90 depression scale. Health services costs were measured using health care plan accounting records. RESULTS: Over 24 months, telephone care management led to a gain of 29 depression‐free days (95% confidence interval, ‐6 to +63) and a $676 increase in outpatient health care costs (95% confidence interval, $596 lower to $1974 higher). The incremental net benefit was negative even if a day free of depression was valued up to $20. Care management plus psychotherapy led to a gain of 46 depression‐free days (95% confidence interval, +12 to +80) and a $397 increase in outpatient costs (95% confidence interval, $882 lower to $1725 higher). The incremental net benefit was positive if a day free of depression was valued at $9 or greater. CONCLUSION: Compared with current primary care practice, a structured telephone program including care management and cognitive behavioral psychotherapy has significant clinical benefit with only a modest increase in health services cost.

AB: Purpose of the study The primary aim of the study was to assess whether asthma control could be improved through a virtual asthma clinic (VAC) for children with asthma, while reducing the regular visits to the outpatient clinic by 50%. Alongside this randomized controlled trial, an a‐priori defined cost‐effectiveness analysis was carried out to determine whether the clinical benefits gained with the VAC were attained at reasonable costs. Methods Randomized controlled, prospective, 8‐center study of 16 months duration in children with asthma (6‐16 yrs). Usual care consisted of 4‐ monthly outpatient visits and a digital age‐specific questionnaire on asthma control (C‐ACT: 6‐12 yrs, ACT: 12‐16 yrs) at 0, 8 and 16 months. In the VAC group, children were followed online with a monthly ACT and were seen at the outpatient clinic every 8 months. The primary outcome measure was asthma control. Costs were assed from both healthcare and societal perspectives. Mean incremental costs were weighted against the mean incremental effect in terms of ACT. Ninety‐five percent uncertainty boundaries in the incremental cost effectiveness ratio were determined non‐parametrically using bootstrapping (1000 replications with replacement). Results Two‐hundred‐ten children (mean age 11.3 yrs (±SD 2.8 yrs; 60% male) were included. After 16 months of follow‐up, asthma control measured with the C‐ACT was significantly better in the VAC‐group compared to the UCgroup (1.56 points (95% CI 0.18 to 2.94, p=0.03). There was no difference in ACT‐score (0.28 points (95% CI 1.67‐2.23), p=0.78). The total healthcare costs were lower in the VAC group, with a mean difference of s280.39 and 95 percentiles ranging from €‐686.93 to €126.16. The difference in societal cost was estimated at €454.13 (95% percentiles €‐ 941.46 to €33.21), in favor of the VAC. Figure 1 presents the results from the 1000 bootstrapped replications concerning ACT and costs (direct and indirect) for a 16‐month study period. A 98% of the 1000 bootstrapped replications resulted in cost savings with a mean cost saving of €473.00 (95 percentiles ‐€46; ‐€1068). Conclusion The virtual asthma clinic for children is an effective e‐health innovation to improve asthma care and is cost‐effective.

AB: Background: The use of telemedicine enables continuous and tailored control of chronically ill patients, potentially providing a solution to the medical, social and financial impact of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Safety of a web telemanagement system designed for complex IBD patients, TECCU (Telemonitorizacion de la Enfermedad de Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa [Telemonitoring of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis]) and its impact on healthcare utilisation, compared with standard care (G‐Control) and nurseassisted telephone care (G‐NT) were evaluated. Methods: A 3‐arm randomised clinical trial was performed in an academic hospital in Spain. IBD patients aged ≥18 years who initiated therapy with corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and/or biological agents for disease activity were consecutively included. Exclusion criteria were: patients with ileorectal/ileo‐pouch anal anastomosis, no Internet access and inability to communicate properly in Spanish. Eligible participants were randomised to receive remote monitoring (G‐TECCU), G‐NT or G‐control for 24 weeks in a 1:1:1 ratio using a web‐based program. TECCU is a secured webpage with an HTTPS application for smartphone, tablet and computer. Healthcare resources were measured including the number of outpatient visits and telephone calls attended by healthcare providers. Safety was defined in terms of emergency visits, corticosteroid courses, hospitalisations, and IBD‐related surgeries. In addition, the cost of each procedure was assessed using official prices of each health service. Results: 63 patients were included and 21 were randomly assigned to each group. Most patients had CD‐14 (66.7%) in G‐control, 13 (61.9%) in G‐NT, and 13 (61.9%) in G‐TECCU. The median of disease progression was 146.7 months (range 7‐424) in G‐TECCU, 123.3 (6‐427) in G‐control and 108.3 (7‐452) in G‐NT, respectively. The percentage of patients treated with immunomodulators was 47.6% vs. 47.6% vs. 42.9% in G‐control, G‐AT and G‐TECCU, respectively, and 47.6% vs. 42.9% vs. 47.6% with biologic mono or combo therapy in G‐control, G‐AT and G‐TECCU, respectively. After 24 weeks, the total number of outpatient visits and phone calls was lower in the G‐TECCU (72 visits, 12 phone calls) compared with G‐AT (85 visits, 118 phone calls) and G‐control (131 visits, 47 phone calls), which represent a cost of 3205 vs. 5342 vs. 6210 euros in G‐TECCU vs. G‐AT vs. G‐control, respectively. There were not differences among groups in the number of emergency visits, IBDrelated surgeries, hospitalisations, use of corticosteroids and medication adverse effects during the study period. Conclusions: TECCU web program is a safe and innovative tool for management of complex IBD patients, which reduce health care costs in terms of outpatient visits and phone calls.

AB: BACKGROUND: Physical training has beneficial effects on exercise capacity, quality of life and mortality in patients after a cardiac event or intervention and is therefore a core component of cardiac rehabilitation. However, cardiac rehabilitation uptake is low and effects tend to decrease after the initial rehabilitation period. Home‐based training has the potential to increase cardiac rehabilitation uptake, and was shown to be safe and effective in improving short‐term exercise capacity. Long‐term effects on physical fitness and activity, however, are disappointing. Therefore, we propose a novel strategy using telemonitoring guidance based on objective training data acquired during exercise at home. In this way, we aim to improve self‐management skills like self‐efficacy and action planning for independent exercise and, consequently, improve long‐term effectiveness with respect to physical fitness and physical activity. In addition, we aim to compare costs of this strategy with centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation. METHODS/DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial compares a 12‐week telemonitoring guided home‐based training program with a regular, 12‐week centre‐based training program of equal duration and training intensity in low to moderate risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation after an acute coronary syndrome or cardiac intervention. The home‐based group receives three supervised training sessions before they commence training with a heart rate monitor in their home environment. Participants are instructed to train at 70‐85% of their maximal heart rate for 45‐60 minutes, twice a week. Patients receive individual coaching by telephone once a week, based on measured heart rate data that are shared through the internet. Primary endpoints are physical fitness and physical activity, assessed at baseline, after 12 weeks and after one year. Physical fitness is expressed as peak oxygen uptake, assessed by symptom limited exercise testing with gas exchange analysis; physical activity is expressed as physical activity energy expenditure, assessed by tri‐axial accelerometry and heart rate measurements. Secondary endpoints are training adherence, quality of life, patient satisfaction and cost‐effectiveness. DISCUSSION: This study will increase insight in long‐term effectiveness and costs of home‐based cardiac rehabilitation with telemonitoring guidance. This strategy is in line with the trend to shift non‐complex healthcare services towards patients' home environments. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register: NTR3780.

AB: BACKGROUND: Effectiveness of Internet‐based self‐management in patients with asthma has been shown, but its cost‐effectiveness is unknown. We conducted a cost‐effectiveness analysis of Internet‐based asthma self‐management compared with usual care. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cost‐effectiveness analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial, with 12 months follow‐up. Patients were aged 18 to 50 year and had physician diagnosed asthma. The Internet‐based self‐management program involved weekly on‐line monitoring of asthma control with self‐treatment advice, remote Web communications, and Internet‐based information. We determined quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as measured by the EuroQol‐5D and costs for health care use and absenteeism. We performed a detailed cost price analysis for the primary intervention. QALYs did not statistically significantly differ between the Internet group and usual care: difference 0.024 (95% CI, ‐0.016 to 0.065). Costs of the Internet‐based intervention were $254 (95% CI, $243 to $265) during the period of 1 year. From a societal perspective, the cost difference was $641 (95% CI, $‐1957 to $3240). From a health care perspective, the cost difference was $37 (95% CI, $‐874 to $950). At a willingness‐to‐pay of $50,000 per QALY, the probability that Internet‐based self‐management was cost‐effective compared to usual care was 62% and 82% from a societal and health care perspective, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Internet‐based self‐management of asthma can be as effective as current asthma care and costs are similar. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN79864465.

AB: Objectives: In‐ambulance telemedicine for stroke patients is a promising new approach to speed up treatment and improve patient outcome. Literature data prove that faster stroke treatment leads to better patient outcome and that in‐ambulance telemedicine is safe, feasible and reliable. A cost‐utility model can provide more objective information on the costs and benefits associated with this new telemedi cine treatment. Methods: Current standard stroke care is compared with current standard stroke care including in‐ambulance telemedicine, applying a cost‐utility model measuring costs and QALY's from a societal perspective. We combine a decision tree model with a Markov model, using a lifetime horizon. Data from the Stroke Registry UZ Brussel (2.282 stroke patients) and linked hospital claims data at individual level are combined with findings from literature to populate the model. The effects of in‐ambulance telemedicine are modeled assuming an average decrease of 30 minutes in the initiation of treatment. This results in a higher proportion of patients fitting the time window for thrombolysis and a higher proportion of endovascular treatments compared to standard stroke care. Additionally chances of positive outcome increase, since more patients are treated in an earlier timewindow. The cost‐effectiveness threshold was defined at € 35.000/QALY. One‐way sensitivity analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis are applied, using Monte Carlo simulations with 5.000 bootstraps to account for the uncertainty around the input parameters. Results: Taking a lifetime horizon into account, in‐ambulance telemedicine is a dominant strategy, decreasing costs by € 709 per stroke patient and resulting in 0,027 QALY's gained per patient. In 93% of all probabilistic simulations in‐ambulance telemedicine remains under the cost‐effectiveness threshold. Conclusions: In‐ambulance telemedicine seems to be highly cost‐effective from a societal perspective. To further validate this model, data from randomized clinical trials on time to treatment initiation and patient outcome are needed.

AB: Severely ill malaria patients with vomiting, prostration and coma cannot be treated orally and require injections. In remote areas, the access to health facilities providing such parenteral treatment is limited. Hence, safe and effective treatment of most severe childhood cases is delayed or not achieved. A large‐scale randomized controlled trial of children with suspected severe malaria in rural Ghana, Tanzania, and Bangladesh showed that a single dose of rectal artesunate prior to referral for standard parenteral therapy reduced mortality and permanent disability by 30%. Rectal artesunate affects the progression of the disease by rapidly reducing parasite density. We estimated the incremental cost‐effectiveness of prereferral rectal artesunate treatment followed by parenteral treatment relative to the existing practice of parenteral treatment in health facilities. Health outcomes are estimated based on the trial efficacy results and severe malaria incidence in children living under stable endemic conditions. We considered the incremental costs of providing artesunate suppositories in rural villages through a network of community health workers to a target population of 50,000 people. We also account for the initial start‐up costs to establish a community‐based program. We included variable costs of inpatient care as pre‐referral treatment was assumed to reduce the average length of inpatient stay from 7 to 3 days among recovered patients. While taking cost savings due to a shorter inpatient stay into consideration, fixed costs of inpatient care were excluded, as these would not change due to the intervention. Assuming full coverage with pre‐referral treatment at the community level, the cost ranges from $6,952 per death averted to a cost savings of $109 per death averted and from $208 per DALY averted to a cost savings of $3 per DALY averted, depending on the level of patient adherence to referral for standard parenteral treatment. Under at least moderate coverage and assuming a moderate level of adherence to referral, pre‐referral treatment with rectal artesunate is a cost‐effective adjunct to standard parenteral treatment of severe malaria cases, judged by a standard of under US$ 150 per DALY averted for an 'attractive' intervention. Under at least high coverage and assuming a high level of adherence to referral, the intervention is 'highly attractive' with a cut‐off value of $25 per DALY averted.

AB: Rationale: With limited evidence for clinical effectiveness of patient‐centered home‐telemonitoring in cancer self‐management, a study was designed to improve oncology clinical outcomes in rural Appalachia. Analyses examined differences in healthcare utilization and cost for lung cancer patients with and without home‐telemonitoring. Methods: A randomized clinical trial pilot study was conducted in a mountainous Appalachian area with 47 patients (telemonitoring: 26 & control: 21) diagnosed with lung cancer recruited through a university hospital and cancer center. The majority were married male Caucasians with a current/past smoking history, high school education, overweight/obese based on BMI, and diagnosed with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in advanced stages. Group differences of healthcare utilization and health utility measures were compared by Mann‐Whitney/t‐test to identify a trend for cost‐effectiveness. Health utility measures (EQ5D index and one‐year direct medical cost) were also evaluated at study time‐points compared to baseline. Results: During the two‐month study time period, compared to control, telemonitored patients survived longer had more scheduled medical visits (96% vs. 75%); made more unplanned calls to doctors and nurses (32% vs. 30% & 64% vs. 50%, respectively); were less often rehospitalized (28% vs. 40%), and had slightly higher ER use (36% vs. 30%). Healthcare resource utilization overall did not show significant differences or patterns between groups (p> 0.05; Figure 1). The telemonitored group had higher in‐hospital costs prior to study participation and during the study period; however, in four months following the study, average lower costs were observed for those intervention patients who were still alive. The overall costs during the entire period are actually lower in the controls which may be related to earlier deaths than in telemonitored patients. In comparing changes from baseline, the intervention group did show relative improvements on both the index health utility value (0.08; 0=death/1=perfect health) and the visual analog scale (17 points on a 0‐100 VAS) that approached significance. Conclusions: Study findings suggest that home telemonitoring can decrease acute‐care utilization for patients with lung cancer, but have no significant effect on cost outcomes. Although overall cost was higher in the telemonitored group, patients' QOL was improved. Findings are limited by attrition (reduced power) and limited long‐term intervention effects on cost. Nevertheless, further study is warranted with a larger sample to validate trends for positive patient and clinical outcomes in remote Appalachian areas. (Figure Presented).

AB: Background: This study examined whether delivering behavioral activation for depression through telehealth is cost‐effective compared to in‐person care. Methods: This was a randomized, noninferiority trial, with participants assigned to 1 of 2 arms of 8‐week behavioral activation therapy: in‐person or via telehealth. Primary clinical outcomes included measures of depression (Geriatric Depression Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐IV) at 12 months follow‐up. Quality of life was assessed using the 36‐Item Short Form Health Survey. Economic outcomes included the difference in health services utilization costs between 1 year post‐intervention and 1 year pre‐intervention, as quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs), and incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios for differences in cost based on mean travel and median travel relative to the 3 primary outcomes and QALYs. Results: 241 participants were enrolled and completed study procedures between April 2007 and July 2012. Post‐intervention, veterans treated inperson had a mean of $2,998 higher VA health care utilization costs relative to their pre‐intervention utilization costs, while veterans treated via telehealth had a mean of $870.91 higher costs post‐intervention relative to preintervention. The difference between bootstrap mean and median QALYs was not significantly different from zero. Conclusions: Although the intervention costs for telehealth were higher relative to in‐person care, veterans receiving behavioral activation via telehealth had lower health utilization costs 1 year after the intervention than those receiving care in person while QALYs were approximately the same. These results demonstrate the noninferiority of telehealth in treating depression in veterans with respect to QALYs and a large and significant cost benefit of using telehealth in terms of health services utilization post‐intervention.

AB: BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to report the economic outcomes of a new synchronous telepractice service providing speech pathology intervention to patients with head and neck cancer at nonmetropolitan facilities. METHODS: A multisite randomized controlled trial comparing standard care versus a new synchronous telepractice model was conducted within a large Australian public cancer service. Data pertaining to health service costs (staff wages, equipment, and patient travel reimbursement), patient +/‐ carer costs (travel and wages), and patient‐reported quality of life (Assessment of Quality of Life questionnaire 4D) were collected. RESULTS: Eighty‐two referrals (39 standard care and 43 synchronous telepractice care) were managed. The new telepractice service reported average cost savings of 12% (P < .0058) for the health service and $40.05 saving per patient per referral. An equivalent positive increase in quality of life (0.04) was reported for both groups. CONCLUSION: The synchronous telepractice service provides cost efficiencies over standard care for providing remote specialist speech pathology head and neck cancer intervention.

AB: BACKGROUND: Although effective psychotherapies for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exist, high percentages of Veterans in need of services are unable to access them. One particular challenge to providing cost‐effective psychological treatments to Veterans with PTSD involves the difficulty and high cost of delivering in‐person, specialized psychotherapy to Veterans residing in geographically remote locations. The delivery of these services via clinical videoteleconferencing (CVT) has been presented as a potential solution to this access to care problem. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective cost analysis of a randomized controlled trial investigating telemedicine service delivery of an anger management therapy for Veterans with PTSD. The parent trial found that the CVT condition provided clinical results that were comparable to the in‐person condition. Several cost outcomes were calculated in order to investigate the clinical and cost outcomes associated with the CVT delivery modality relative to in‐person delivery. RESULTS: The CVT condition was significantly associated with lower total costs compared with the in‐person delivery condition. The delivery of mental health services via CVT enables Veterans who would not normally receive these services access to empirically based treatments. Additional studies addressing long‐term healthcare system costs, indirect cost factors at the patient and societal levels, and the use of CVT in other geographic regions of the United States are needed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide evidence that CVT is a cost‐reducing mode of service delivery to Veterans with PTSD relative to in‐person delivery.

AB: Telegenetics‐genetic counseling via live videoconferencing‐can improve access to cancer genetic counseling (CGC) in underserved areas, but studies on cancer telegenetics have not applied randomized methodology or assessed cost. We report cost, patient satisfaction and CGC attendance from a randomized trial comparing telegenetics with in‐person CGC among individuals referred to CGC in four rural oncology clinics. Participants (n = 162) were randomized to receive CGC at their local oncology clinic in‐person or via telegenetics. Cost analyses included telegenetics system; mileage; and personnel costs for genetic counselor, IT specialist, and clinic personnel. CGC attendance was tracked via study database. Patient satisfaction was assessed 1 week post‐CGC via telephone survey using validated scales. Total costs were $106 per telegenetics patient and $244 per in‐person patient. Patient satisfaction did not differ by group on either satisfaction scale. In‐person patients were significantly more likely to attend CGC than telegenetics patients (89 vs. 79 %, p = 0.03), with bivariate analyses showing an association between lesser computer comfort and lower attendance rate (Chi‐square = 5.49, p = 0.02). Our randomized trial of telegenetics vs. in‐person counseling found that telegenetics cost less than in‐person counseling, with high satisfaction among those who attended. This study provides support for future randomized trials comparing multiple service delivery models on longer‐term psychosocial and behavioral outcomes.

AB: BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation provided through home visits is part of the continuum of care after discharge from hospital following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). As demands for rehabilitation at home are growing and becoming more difficult to meet, in‐home telerehabilitation has been proposed as an alternate service delivery method. However, there is a need for robust data concerning both the effectiveness and the cost of dispensing in‐home telerehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to document, analyze, and compare real costs of two service delivery methods: in‐home telerehabilitation and conventional home visits. METHODS: The economic analysis was conducted as part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) on telerehabilitation for TKA, and involved data from 197 patients, post‐TKA. Twice a week for 8 weeks, participants received supervised physiotherapy via two delivery methods, depending on their study group allocation: in‐home telerehabilitation (TELE) and home‐visit rehabilitation (VISIT). Patients were recruited from eight hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada. The TELE group intervention was delivered by videoconferencing over high‐speed Internet. The VISIT group received the same intervention at home. Costs related to the delivery of the two services (TELE and VISIT) were calculated. Student's t tests were used to compare costs per treatment between the two groups. To take distance into account, the two treatment groups were compared within distance strata using two‐way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). RESULTS: The mean cost of a single session was Can $93.08 for the VISIT group (SD $35.70) and $80.99 for the TELE group (SD $26.60). When comparing both groups, real total cost analysis showed a cost differential in favor of the TELE group (TELE minus VISIT: ‐$263, 95% CI ‐$382 to ‐$143). However, when the patient's home was located less than 30 km round‐trip from the health care center, the difference in costs between TELE and VISIT treatments was not significant (P=.25, .26, and .11 for the <10, 10‐19, and 20‐29 km strata, respectively). The cost of TELE treatments was lower than VISIT treatments when the distance was 30 km or more (30‐49 km: $81<$103, P=.002; ≥50 km: $90<$152, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study of the actual costs of in‐home telerehabilitation covering all subcosts of telerehabilitation and distance between the health care center and the patient's home. The cost for a single session of in‐home telerehabilitation compared to conventional home‐visit rehabilitation was lower or about the same, depending on the distance between the patient's home and health care center. Under the controlled conditions of an RCT, a favorable cost differential was observed when the patient was more than 30 km from the provider. Stakeholders and program planners can use these data to guide decisions regarding introducing telerehabilitation as a new service in their clinic.

AB: OBJECTIVE: A number of effective treatments for bulimia nervosa have been developed, but they are infrequently used, in part due to problems with dissemination. The goal of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of telemedicine delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial of face‐to‐face versus telemedicine cognitive behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa. One hundred twenty eight women with DSM‐IV bulimia nervosa or eating disorder, not otherwise specified subsyndromal variants of bulimia nervosa were randomized to 20 sessions of treatment over 16 weeks. A cost effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective was conducted. RESULTS: The total cost per recovered (abstinent) subject was $9324.68 for face‐to‐face CBT, and $7300.40 for telemedicine CBT. The cost differential was accounted for largely by therapist travel costs. Sensitivity analyses examining therapy session costs, gasoline costs and telemedicine connection costs yielded fundamentally similar results. DISCUSSION: In this study, CBT delivered face‐to‐face and via telemedicine were similarly effective, and telemedicine delivery cost substantially less. These findings underscore the potential applicability of telemedicine approaches to eating disorder treatment and psychiatric treatment in general.

AB: BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation can reduce mortality of patients with cardiovascular disease, but a frequently low participation rate in rehabilitation programs has been found globally. The objective of the Teledialog study was to assess the cost‐utility (CU) of a cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) program. The aim of the intervention was to increase the patients' participation in the CTR program. At discharge, an individualized 3‐month rehabilitation plan was formulated for each patient. At home, the patients measured their own blood pressure, pulse, weight, and steps taken for 3 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis was carried out together with a randomized controlled trial with 151 patients during 2012‐2014. Costs of the intervention were estimated with a health sector perspective following international guidelines for CU. Quality of life was assessed using the 36‐Item Short Form Health Survey. RESULTS: The rehabilitation activities were approximately the same in the two groups, but the number of contacts with the physiotherapist was higher among the intervention group. The mean total cost per patient was €1,700 higher in the intervention group. The quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) gain was higher in the intervention group, but the difference was not statistically significant. The incremental CU ratio was more than €400,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Even though the rehabilitation activities increased, the program does not appear to be cost‐effective. The intervention itself was not costly (less than €500), and increasing the number of patients may show reduced costs of the devices and make the CTR more cost‐effective. Telerehabilitation can increase participation, but the intervention, in its current form, does not appear to be cost‐effective.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of reminder/recall (R/R) for immunizing adolescents in private pediatric practices and to describe the associated costs and revenues. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in 4 private pediatric practices in metropolitan Denver. In each practice, 400 adolescents aged 11 to 18 years who had not received 1 or more targeted vaccinations (tetanus‐diphtheria‐acellular pertussis, meningococcal conjugate, or first dose of human papillomavirus vaccine for female patients) were randomly selected and randomized to intervention (2 letters and 2 telephone calls) or control (usual care) groups. Primary outcomes were receipt of >1 targeted vaccines and receipt of all targeted vaccines 6 months postintervention. We calculated net additional revenue for each additional adolescent who received at least 1 targeted vaccine and for those who received all targeted vaccines. RESULTS: Eight hundred adolescents were randomized to the intervention and 800 to the control group. Baseline rates of having already received tetanus‐diphtheria‐acellular pertussis, meningococcal conjugate, and first dose of human papillomavirus vaccine before R/R ranged from 33% to 54%. Postintervention, the intervention group had significantly higher proportions of receipt of at least 1 targeted vaccine (47.1% vs 34.6%, P < .0001) and receipt of all targeted vaccines (36.2% vs 25.2%, P < .0001) compared with the control group. Three practices had positive net revenues from R/R; 1 showed net losses. CONCLUSIONS: R/R was successful at increasing immunization rates in adolescents and effect sizes were comparable to those in younger children. Practices conducting R/R may benefit financially if they can generate additional well‐child care visits and keep supply costs low. Copyright 2012 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB: We examined the incremental cost‐effectiveness of telemonitoring (TM) versus usual care (UC) in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). In one university and two general hospitals, 382 patients were randomised to usual care or telemonitoring and followed for 1 year. Hospital‐related and home costs were estimated, based on resource use multiplied by the appropriate unit prices. Effectiveness was expressed as QALYs gained. Information was gathered, using 3 monthly costs diaries and questionnaires. The mean age of the patients was 71 years (range 32‐93), 59% were male and 64% lived with a partner. Health related quality of life improved by 0.07 points for the usual care and 0.1 points for the telemonitoring group, but the difference between groups was not significant. There were no significant differences in annual costs per patient between groups. At a threshold of 50,000 the probability of telemonitoring being cost‐effective was 48%. The cost effectiveness analysis showed a high level of decision uncertainty, probably caused by the divergence between the participating institutions. It is therefore premature to draw an unambiguous conclusion regarding cost‐effectiveness for the whole group.

AB: BACKGROUND: From 1992 to 2008, older adults in the United States incurred more healthcare expense per capita than any other age group. Home telemonitoring has emerged as a potential solution to reduce these costs, but evidence is mixed. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate whether the mean difference in total direct medical cost consequence between older adults receiving additional home telemonitoring care (TELE) (n=102) and those receiving usual medical care (UC) (n=103) were significant. Inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, decedents, survivors, and 30‐day readmission costs were evaluated as secondary aim. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multivariate generalized linear models (GLMs) and parametric bootstrapping method were used to model cost and to determine significance of the cost differences. We also compared the differences in arithmetic mean costs. RESULTS: From the conditional GLMs, the estimated mean cost differences (TELE versus UC) for total, inpatient, outpatient, and ED were ‐$9,537 (p=0.068), ‐$8,482 (p =0.098), ‐$1,160 (p=0.177), and $106 (p=0.619), respectively. Mean postenrollment cost was 11% lower than the prior year for TELE versus 22% higher for UC. The ratio of mean cost for decedents to survivors was 2.1:1 (TELE) versus 12.7:1 (UC). CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the mean total cost between the two treatment groups. The TELE group had less variability in cost of care, lower decedents to survivors cost ratio, and lower total 30‐day readmission cost than the UC group.

AB: BACKGROUND: In rural America, cigarette smoking is prevalent and health care providers lack the time and resources to help smokers quit. Telephone quitlines are important avenues for cessation services in rural areas, but they are poorly integrated with local health care resources. OBJECTIVE: The intent of the study was to assess the comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of two models for delivering expert tobacco treatment at a distance: telemedicine counseling that was integrated into smokers' primary care clinics (Integrated Telemedicine‐ITM) versus telephone counseling, similar to telephone quitline counseling, delivered to smokers in their homes (Phone). METHODS: Smokers (n=566) were recruited offline from 20 primary care and safety net clinics across Kansas. They were randomly assigned to receive 4 sessions of ITM or 4 sessions of Phone counseling. Patients in ITM received real‐time video counseling, similar to Skype, delivered by computer/webcams in clinic exam rooms. Three full‐time equivalent trained counselors delivered the counseling. The counseling duration and content was the same in both groups and was available in Spanish or English. Both groups also received identical materials and assistance in selecting and obtaining cessation medications. The primary outcome was verified 7‐day point prevalence smoking abstinence at month 12, using an intent‐to‐treat analysis. RESULTS: There were no significant baseline differences between groups, and the trial achieved 88% follow‐up at 12 months. Verified abstinence at 12 months did not significantly differ between ITM or Phone (9.8%, 27/280 vs 12%, 34/286; P=.406). Phone participants completed somewhat more counseling sessions than ITM (mean 2.6, SD 1.5 vs mean 2.4, SD 1.5; P=.0837); however, participants in ITM were significantly more likely to use cessation medications than participants in Phone (55.9%, 128/280 vs 46.1%, 107/286; P=.03). Compared to Phone participants, ITM participants were significantly more likely to recommend the program to a family member or friend (P=.0075). From the combined provider plus participant (societal) perspective, Phone was significantly less costly than ITM. Participants in ITM had to incur time and mileage costs to travel to clinics for ITM sessions. From the provider perspective, counseling costs were similar between ITM (US $45.46, SD 31.50) and Phone (US $49.58, SD 33.35); however, total provider costs varied widely depending on how the clinic space for delivering ITM was valued. CONCLUSIONS: Findings did not support the superiority of ITM over telephone counseling for helping rural patients quit smoking. ITM increased utilization of cessation pharmacotherapy and produced higher participant satisfaction, but Phone counseling was significantly less expensive. Future interventions could combine elements of both approaches to optimize pharmacotherapy utilization, counseling adherence, and satisfaction. Such an approach could commence with a telemedicine‐delivered clinic office visit for pharmacotherapy guidance, and continue with telephone or real‐time video counseling delivered via mobile phones to flexibly deliver behavioral support to patients where they most need it‐in their homes and communities.

AB: Aims: Self‐monitoring and self‐titration of antihypertensives (self‐management) is a novel intervention which improves blood pressure control. However, little evidence exists regarding the cost‐effectiveness of self‐monitoring of blood pressure in general and self‐management in particular. This study aimed to evaluate whether self‐management of hypertension was cost‐effective. Design and methods: A cohort Markov model‐based probabilistic cost‐effectiveness analysis was undertaken extrapolating to up to 35 years from cost and outcome data collected from the telemonitoring and self‐management in hypertension trial (TASMINH2). Self‐management of hypertension was compared with usual care in terms of lifetime costs, quality adjusted life years and cost‐effectiveness using a UK Health Service perspective. Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of different time horizons and reduced effectiveness over time from self‐management. Results: In the long‐term, when compared with usual care, self‐management was more effective by 0.24 and 0.12 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient for men and women, respectively. The resultant incremental costeffectiveness ratio for self‐management was 1624 per QALY for men and 4923 per QALY for women. There was at least a 99% chance of the intervention being cost‐effective for both sexes at a willingness to pay threshold of 20,000 per QALY gained. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses around the assumptions made, provided that the effects of self‐management lasted at least two years for men and five years for women. Conclusion: Self‐monitoring with self‐titration of antihypertensives and telemonitoring of blood pressure measurements not only reduces blood pressure, compared with usual care, but also represents a cost‐effective use of health care resources.

AB: IMPORTANCE The costs and utility of teledermatology are important features of implementation. Such an analysis requires a description of the perspective of the entity that will bear the cost. OBJECTIVE To assess the costs and utility of a store‐and‐forward teledermatology referral process compared with a conventional referral process from the perspectives of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and society. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three hundred ninety‐one randomized participants were referred from remote sites of primary care to the dermatology services of 2 VA medical facilities for ambulatory skin conditions from December 2008 through June 2010, and follow‐up was completed in March 2011. The time trade‐off utility measures and costs were collected during a 9‐month period among participants in a 2‐site parallel group randomized clinical trial. The perspectives of the VA and society were evaluated. The multiple imputation procedure or weighted means were used for missing data elements. Data were analyzed from January to July 2014. INTERVENTIONS Referrals were managed using store‐and‐forward teledermatology or a conventional text‐based referral process. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Total costs from the perspectives of the VA and society incurred during the 9‐month follow‐up were used to derive per‐participant costs. Utility using the time trade‐off method, was the measure of effectiveness. RESULTS From the VA perspective, the total cost for conventional referrals was $66 145 (minimum, $58 697; maximum, $71 635), or $338 (SD, $291) per participant (196 participants); the total cost for teledermatology referrals was $59 917 (mimimum, $51 794; maximum, $70 398), or $308 (SD, $298) per participant (195 participants). The $30 difference in per‐participant cost was not statistically significant (95%CI, ‐$79 to $20). From the societal perspective, the total cost for conventional referrals was $106 194 (minimum $98 746; maximum, $111 684), or $542 (SD, $403) per participant (196 participants); the total cost for teledermatology referrals was $89 523 (minimum, $81 400; maximum $100 400) or $460 (SD, $428) per participant. This $82 difference in per‐participant cost was statistically significant (95%CI, ‐$12 to ‐$152). From baseline to the 9‐month follow‐up the time trade‐off utility value improved by 0.02 in the conventional referral group and 0.03 in the teledermatology group. This difference was not statistically significant (P = .50). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Compared with conventional referrals, store‐and‐forward teledermatology referrals were performed at a comparable cost (VA perspective) or at a lower cost (societal perspective) with no evidence of a difference in utility as measured by the time trade‐off method.

AB: Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality in the United States and presents a substantial economic burden. A recently approved implantable wireless pulmonary artery pressure remote monitor, the CardioMEMS HF System, has been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalizations among New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III HF patients. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost‐effectiveness of this remote monitoring technology compared to standard of care treatment for HF. A Markov cohort model relying on the CHAMPION (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Class III Heart Failure Patients) clinical trial for mortality and hospitalization data, published sources for cost data, and a mix of CHAMPION data and published sources for utility data, was developed. The model compares outcomes over 5 years for implanted vs standard of care patients, allowing patients to accrue costs and utilities while they remain alive. Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty in input parameters. The CardioMEMS HF System was found to be cost‐effective, with an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio of $44,832 per quality‐adjusted life year (QALY). Sensitivity analysis found the model was sensitive to the device cost and to whether mortality benefits were sustained, although there were no scenarios in which the cost/QALY exceeded $100,000. Compared with standard of care, the CardioMEMS HF System was cost‐effective when leveraging trial data to populate the model.

AB: Objective: To determine whether mobile phone based monitoring improves asthma control compared with standard paper based monitoring strategies. Design: Multicentre randomised controlled trial with cost effectiveness analysis. Setting: UK primary care. Participants: 288 adolescents and adults with poorly controlled asthma (asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) score >1.5) from 32 practices. Intervention Participants were centrally randomised to twice daily recording and mobile phone based transmission of symptoms, drug use, and peak flow with immediate feedback prompting action according to an agreed plan or paper based monitoring. Main outcome measures: Changes in scores on asthma control questionnaire and self efficacy (knowledge, attitude, and self efficacy asthma questionnaire (KASE‐AQ)) at six months after randomisation. Assessment of outcomes was blinded. Analysis was on an intention to treat basis. Results: There was no significant difference in the change in asthma control or self efficacy between the two groups (ACQ: mean change 0.75 in mobile group v 0.73 in paper group, mean difference in change ‐0.02 (95% confidence interval ‐0.23 to 0.19); KASE‐AQ score: mean change ‐4.4 v ‐2.4, mean difference 2.0 (‐0.3 to 4.2)). The numbers of patients who had acute exacerbations, steroid courses, and unscheduled consultations were similar in both groups, with similar healthcare costs. Overall, the mobile phone service was more expensive because of the expenses of telemonitoring. Conclusions: Mobile technology does not improve asthma control or increase self efficacy compared with paper based monitoring when both groups received clinical care to guidelines standards. The mobile technology was not cost effective.

AB: BACKGROUND: The Dermatology Department of the University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands, developed an e‐health portal for patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), consisting of e‐consultation, a patient‐tailored website, monitoring and self‐management training. OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost‐effectiveness of individualized e‐health compared with usual face‐to‐face care for children and adults with AD. METHODS: A randomized controlled cost‐effectiveness study from a societal perspective in adults and parents of children with moderate AD. Outcomes were quality of life, severity of AD, itching and direct and indirect costs. Data were collected at baseline and at 3 and 12 months after randomization. Linear mixed models were used to analyse clinical outcomes. After multiple imputation of missing data, costs and differences in costs were calculated over a period of 1 year. RESULTS: In total, 199 patients were included. There were no significant differences in disease‐specific quality of life, severity of AD and intensity of itching between both groups at the three time points. The difference in direct costs between the intervention and control groups was €24 [95% confidence interval (CI) ‐360 to 383], whereas this difference was ‐€618 (95% CI ‐2502 to 1143) for indirect costs. Overall, individual e‐health was expected to save €594 (95% CI ‐2545 to 1227) per patient in the first year of treatment, mainly through a reduction in work absenteeism. Uncertainty analyses revealed that the probability of e‐health reducing costs was estimated to be ≥ 73%. CONCLUSIONS: E‐health during follow‐up of patients with AD is, after initial diagnosis and treatment during face‐to‐face contact, just as effective as usual face‐to‐face care with regard to quality of life and severity of disease. However, when costs are considered, e‐health is likely to result in substantial cost savings. Therefore, e‐health is a valuable service for patients with AD.

AB: Study Objective International normalized ratio self‐testing with online remote monitoring and management (STORM2) is an alternative to anticoagulation clinic management, but the patient's perspective of this method has not been evaluated in the United States; thus we sought to evaluate the impact of STORM2 on patient satisfaction, time, and cost. Design Prospective pre‐ and postintervention study. Setting Freestanding clinical research center. Patients Forty‐three patients treated with long‐term warfarin therapy and monitored initially in the anticoagulation clinic setting and then with STORM2, referred from 11 medical practices. Intervention Patients were asked to complete a survey and the Duke Anticoagulation Satisfaction Scale (DASS) before (at baseline) and after at least 3 months of STORM2 (at follow‐up). Measurements and Main Results Patient satisfaction and time were assessed by survey and the DASS. Costs were measured from the patient's perspective. Overall 90% of responders preferred STORM 2 to traditional clinic management. The DASS questions indicated that patients were more satisfied with their anticoagulation treatment and more likely to recommend oral anticoagulation to a friend after experiencing STORM2. In addition, patients found STORM2 to be less complicated and more convenient than traditional clinic management. For each traditional monthly visit, patients drove 20 miles and expended a total of 1.8 hours; using 55/mile for mileage reimbursement and 15/hour for lost wages, the cost for each visit was 38. The total cost for four STORM2 visits per month was 10, for a net savings of 28 per patient per month. A total of 76% of patients were willing to pay additional money to eliminate a monthly clinic visit. Conclusion STORM2 is more convenient, less complicated, preferred by patients, and saves patients time and money compared with clinic management. 2013 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.

AB: BACKGROUND Adequacy assessment for fine‐needle aspiration procedures is a standard of care in large medical centers. Although the benefits of this approach include higher adequacy rates with fewer passes, it costs cytopathologist time and affects other clinical responsibilities. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the use of mobile video streaming (FaceTime) technology with the help of smartphone adapters attached to microscopes for remote adequacy assessment of cytologic samples. METHODS The study consisted of 2 phases: Phase 1 was a retrospective assessment of 25 samples by a primary pathologist with simultaneous streaming to a second pathologist using a smartphone (iPhone/iPad) FaceTime connection. Data on the adequacy of each sample and preliminary diagnoses were recorded. In phase 2, live cases were assessed prospectively by an onsite primary pathologist and by a remote pathologist using an iPhone/iPad‐FaceTime connection. The testing phase involved prospective assessment of additional samples with a resident or cytotechnologist as the slide driver. RESULTS In phase 1, retrospective evaluation of 25 samples yielded considerable agreement (22 of 25 samples; 88%) between onsite and remote adequacy assessments. Three samples (12%) yielded results that did not agree, including 2 samples that were read as adequate in the onsite evaluation that were assessed as indeterminate using FaceTime. In phase 2 and in the testing phase, 14 samples exhibited considerable agreement on both adequacy and preliminary diagnosis (6 samples in phase 2 and 8 samples in the testing phase) and are currently available for reporting. Problems encountered include software version standardization, camera alignment, and (rarely) comprehension of the audio stream. CONCLUSIONS The current data indicate that iPhone/iPad FaceTime technology can be used to perform remote adequacy assessments of fine‐needle aspirations and can help save valuable time for pathologists.

AB: Introduction Treatment adjustments in Parkinson's disease (PD) are in part dependent on motor assessments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of home‐based motor monitoring plus standard in‐office visits versus in‐office visits alone in patients with advanced PD. Methods The procedures consisted of a prospective, one‐year follow‐up, randomized, case‐control study. A total of 40 patients with advanced PD were randomized into two groups: 20 patients underwent home‐based motor monitoring by using wireless motion sensor technology, while the other 20 patients had in‐office visits. Motor and non‐motor symptom severities, quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and comorbidities were assessed every four months. Direct costs were assessed using a standardized questionnaire. Cost‐effectiveness was assessed using the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results Both groups of PD patients were largely comparable in their clinical and demographic variables at baseline; however, there were more participants using levodopa‐carbidopa intestinal gel in the home‐based motor monitoring group. There was a trend for lower Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale functional status (UPDRS II) scores in the patients monitored at home compared to the standard clinical follow‐up ( p=0.06). However, UPDRS parts I, III, IV and quality‐adjusted life‐years scores were similar between both groups. Home‐based motor monitoring was cost‐effective in terms of improvement of functional status, motor severity, and motor complications (UPDRS II, III; IV subscales), with an ICER/UPDRS ranging from 126.72 to 701.31, respectively. Discussion Home‐based motor monitoring is a tool which collects cost‐effective clinical information and helps augment health care for patients with advanced PD.

AB: BACKGROUND: While point of care testing (PoCT) for general practitioners is becoming increasingly popular, few studies have investigated whether it represents value for money. This study aims to assess the relative cost‐effectiveness of PoCT in general practice (GP) compared to usual testing practice through a pathology laboratory. METHODS: A cost‐effectiveness analysis based on a randomized controlled trial with 4,968 patients followed up for 18 months and fifty‐three general practices in urban, rural and remote locations across three states in Australia.The incremental costs and health outcomes associated with a clinical strategy of PoCT for INR, HbA1c, lipids, and ACR were compared to those from pathology laboratory testing. Costs were expressed in year 2006 Australian dollars. Non‐parametric bootstrapping was used to generate 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The point estimate of the total direct costs per patient to the health care sector for PoCT was less for ACR than for pathology laboratory testing, but greater for INR, HbA1c and Lipids, although none of these differences was statistically significant. PoCT led to significant cost savings to patients and their families. When uncertainty around the point estimates was taken into account, the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PoCT was found to be unfavourable for INR, but somewhat favourable for ACR, while substantial uncertainty still surrounds PoCT for HbA1c and Lipids. CONCLUSIONS: The decision whether to fund PoCT will depend on the price society is willing to pay for achievement of the non‐standard intermediate outcome indicator.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To analyze patient‐related cost and time savings associated with a telemedicine strategy for low‐risk prenatal care compared to traditional care. STUDY DESIGN: Planned secondary analysis of a prospective randomized‐ controlled trial of prenatal care using telemedicine versus traditional care for low‐risk pregnancies in which patient satisfaction was the primary outcome. Low‐risk parous women <16 0/7 weeks' gestation and carrying a singleton fetus were randomized to receive either a combination of telemedicine and 5 scheduled in‐clinic prenatal visits, or traditional in‐clinic care (overall number of prenatal visits was unaltered). Telemedicine encounters used a webbased platform and patients entered weight, blood pressure, and fetal heart rate into the electronic medical record patient portal. The primary outcome for this study was total visit‐related costs and time usage for the patient. Secondary outcomes included costs and time related to work, personal activities, travel, and childcare. Time data were collected through self‐report at 6 visit time points (20, 24, 28, 30, 34, 36 weeks). Analysis was by intent‐to‐treat and conducted using multivariable generalized linear models and 2‐part models. RESULTS: 200 women were randomized and the study groups were statistically similar at baseline. The telemedicine care group had significantly fewer in‐clinic prenatal visits compared to the traditional prenatal care group (7.2 vs.11.3 visits, p<0.0001). Women randomized to telemedicine care had a mean of 4.37 (≥1.9) telemedicine visits. Table 1 shows the time and time cost analyses. Visitrelated costs for women in the telemedicine group were significantly lower compared to women in the traditional arm with a savings of $13 per telemedicine visit and an overall patient savings of approximately $56. Total patient time required for visits was also significantly reduced with telemedicine care saving 40 minutes per telemedicine visit and an overall time savings of 3 hours. CONCLUSION: A novel telemedicine strategy for low‐risk prenatal care is associated with lower visit‐related costs and time savings for patients. (Table Presented).

AB: BACKGROUND: The burden of chronic disease and multimorbidity is rapidly increasing. Self‐management support interventions are effective in reduce cost, especially when targeted at a single disease group; however, economical evidence of such complex interventions remains scarce. The objective of this study was to evaluate a cost‐effectiveness analysis of a tele‐based health‐coaching intervention among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart failure (CHF). METHODS: A total of 1570 patients were blindly randomized to intervention (n = 970) and control (n = 470) groups. The intervention group received monthly individual health coaching by telephone from a specially trained nurse for 12‐months in addition to routine social and healthcare. Patients in the control group received routine social and health care. Quality of life was assessed at the beginning of the intervention and follow‐up measurements were made after 12 months health coaching. The cost included all direct health‐care costs supplemented with home care and nursing home‐care costs in social care. Utility was based on a Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measurement (15D instrument), and cost effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: The cost‐effectiveness of health coaching was highest in the T2D group (ICER €20,000 per Quality‐Adjusted Life Years [QALY]). The ICER for the CAD group was more modest (€40,278 per QALY), and in the CHF group, costs increased with no marked effect on QoL. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that at the societal willingness to pay threshold of €50,000 per QALY, the probability of health coaching being cost effective was 55% in the whole study group. CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of health coaching may vary substantially across patient groups, and thus interventions should be targeted at selected subgroups of chronically ill. Based on the results of this study, health coaching improved the QoL of T2D and CAD patients with moderate costs. However, the results are grounded on a short follow‐up period, and more evidence is needed to evaluate the long‐term outcomes of health‐coaching programs.

AB: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether a lifestyle intervention with individual counselling was cost‐effective for reducing body weight compared with usual care from a company perspective. PARTICIPANTS: Overweight employees were recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention groups, either phone or Internet, or the control group. METHODS: The intervention was based on a cognitive behavioural approach and addressed physical activity and diet. Self‐reported body weight was collected at baseline and 12 months follow‐up. Intervention costs and costs of sick leave days based on gross and net lost productivity days (GLPDs/NLPDs) obtained from the participating companies were calculated. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation techniques. Uncertainty surrounding the differences in costs and the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICER) was estimated by bootstrapping techniques, and presented on cost‐effectiveness planes and cost‐effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in total costs were found between the intervention groups and control group, though mean total costs in both intervention groups tended to be higher than those in the control group. The ICER of the Internet group compared with the control group was €59 per kilogram of weight loss based on GLPD costs. The probability of cost effectiveness of the Internet intervention was 45% at a willingness‐to‐pay of €0 per extra kilogram weight loss and 75% at a willingness‐to‐pay of €1500 per extra kilogram body weight loss. Comparable results were found for the phone intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was not cost effective in comparison with usual care from the company perspective. Due to the large amount of missing data, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions.

AB: BACKGROUND: Given escalating rates of chronic disease, broad‐reach and cost‐effective interventions to increase physical activity and improve dietary intake are needed. The cost‐effectiveness of a Telephone Counselling intervention to improve physical activity and diet, targeting adults with established chronic diseases in a low socio‐economic area of a major Australian city was examined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A cost‐effectiveness modelling study using data collected between February 2005 and November 2007 from a cluster‐randomised trial that compared Telephone Counselling with a "Usual Care" (brief intervention) alternative. Economic outcomes were assessed using a state‐transition Markov model, which predicted the progress of participants through five health states relating to physical activity and dietary improvement, for ten years after recruitment. The costs and health benefits of Telephone Counselling, Usual Care and an existing practice (Real Control) group were compared. Telephone Counselling compared to Usual Care was not cost‐effective ($78,489 per quality adjusted life year gained). However, the Usual Care group did not represent existing practice and is not a useful comparator for decision making. Comparing Telephone Counselling outcomes to existing practice (Real Control), the intervention was found to be cost‐effective ($29,375 per quality adjusted life year gained). Usual Care (brief intervention) compared to existing practice (Real Control) was also cost‐effective ($12,153 per quality adjusted life year gained). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This modelling study shows that a decision to adopt a Telephone Counselling program over existing practice (Real Control) is likely to be cost‐effective. Choosing the 'Usual Care' brief intervention over existing practice (Real Control) shows a lower cost per quality adjusted life year, but the lack of supporting evidence for efficacy or sustainability is an important consideration for decision makers. The economics of behavioural approaches to improving health must be made explicit if decision makers are to be convinced that allocating resources toward such programs is worthwhile. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This paper uses data collected in a previous clinical trial registered at the Australian Clinical Trials Registry, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: Anzcrt.org.au ACTRN012607000195459.

AB: CONTEXT: Collaborative care interventions for depression in primary care settings are clinically beneficial and cost‐effective. Most prior studies were conducted in urban settings. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost‐effectiveness of a rural telemedicine‐based collaborative care depression intervention. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial of intervention vs usual care. SETTING: Seven small (serving 1000 to 5000 veterans) Veterans Health Administration community‐based outpatient clinics serving rural catchment areas in 3 mid‐South states. Each site had interactive televideo dedicated to mental health but no psychiatrist or psychologist on site. Patients Among 18 306 primary care patients who were screened, 1260 (6.9%) screened positive for depression; 395 met eligibility criteria and were enrolled from April 2003 to September 2004. Of those enrolled, 360 (91.1%) completed a 6‐month follow‐up and 335 (84.8%) completed a 12‐month follow‐up. Intervention A stepped‐care model for depression treatment was used by an off‐site depression care team to make treatment recommendations via electronic medical record. The team included a nurse depression care manager, clinical pharmacist, and psychiatrist. The depression care manager communicated with patients via telephone and was supported by computerized decision support software. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The base case cost analysis included outpatient, pharmacy, and intervention expenditures. The effectiveness outcomes were depression‐free days and quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) calculated using the 12‐Item Short Form Health Survey standard gamble conversion formula. RESULTS: The incremental depression‐free days outcome was not significant (P = .10); therefore, further cost‐effectiveness analyses were not done. The incremental QALY outcome was significant (P = .04) and the mean base case incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio was $85 634/QALY. Results adding inpatient costs were $111 999/QALY to $132 175/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: In rural settings, a telemedicine‐based collaborative care intervention for depression is effective and expensive. The mean base case result was $85 634/QALY, which is greater than cost per QALY ratios reported for other, mostly urban, depression collaborative care interventions.

AB: BACKGROUND: Telemonitoring has been advocated as a way of decreasing costs and improving outcomes, but no study has looked at true Medicare payments and 30‐day readmission rates in a randomized group of well treated patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to analyze Medicare claims data to identify effects of home telemonitoring on medical costs, 30‐day rehospitalization, mortality, and health‐related quality of life. METHODS: A total of 204 subjects were randomized to usual‐care and monitored groups and evaluated with the SF‐36 and Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHF). Hospitalizations, Medicare payments, and mortality were also assessed. Monitored subjects transmitted weight, blood pressure, and heart rate, which were monitored by an experienced heart failure nurse practitioner. RESULTS: Subjects were followed for 802 ± 430 days; 75 subjects in the usual‐care group (316 hospitalizations) and 81 in the monitored group (327 hospitalizations) were hospitalized at least once (P = .51). There were no differences in Medicare payments for inpatient or emergency department visits, and length of stay was not different between groups. There was no difference in 30‐day readmissions (P = .627) or mortality (P = .575). Scores for SF‐36 and MLHF improved (P < .001) over time, but there were no differences between groups. The percentage of patients readmitted within 30 days was lower with telemonitoring for the 1st year, but this did not persist. CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring did not result in lower total costs, decreased hospitalizations, improved symptoms, or improved mortality. A decrease in 30‐day readmission rates for the 1st year did not result in decreased total cost or better outcomes.

AB: This project addresses a critical public mental health problem: the need to improve access to high quality, mental health services for diverse populations through improving the flow of clinical work across care settings (primary care and specialty care) by implementing an efficient, provider compatible, administratively simple health IT solution: Asynchronous Telepsychiatry. To assess the impact of this novel approach, this two‐year randomized controlled trial of clinical outcomes seeks to evaluate the superiority of the asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP) consultation model on access, quality, cost and outcomes of care over the usual care for adults referred from primary care clinics for psychiatric evaluation and treatment. Aim 1: To assess whether the ATP delivery model improves clinical OUTCOMES in adult patients referred for psychiatric treatment by their PCPs; Hypotheses: Compared to the participants in the 'usual care" arm, participants in the ATP arm will show: H1: Higher scores over the course of treatment (better clinical trajectory) on the Short‐Form‐12 Health Survey (SF12‐ the primary outcome measure), the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), the Who Disability Schedule (WHODAS) and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score. H2 (Exploratory): Improved clinical trajectories on specific disorder scales, such as the PSQ9, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), the GAD7 and the AUDIT substance abuse scale over the those in the "usual care" arm. Aim 2: To assess whether ATP improves the QUALITY of care for adult patients referred for psychiatric treatment by their PCPs and for PCP providers; Hypotheses: Compared to the participants in the 'usual care" arm, participants in the ATP arm will show: H1: higher levels of satisfaction (as measured by the patient rated Patient Telemedicine Satisfaction Survey which includes a general care satisfaction measure to be used across TAU and ATP groups and by the provider rated Telemedicine Provider Satisfaction Questionnaire) H2 (Exploratory‐ Spanish only speaking participants): will report more positive ratings of their provider on the Interpersonal Processes of Care Survey short form. Hypothesis: PCP's will be highly satisfied with the quality of ATP H3: PCPs with patients referred to the ATP arm will report high satisfaction ratings on the Telemedicine Provider Satisfaction Questionnaire. Aim 3: To assess whether ATP improves EFFICIENCY and REACH through reducing COSTS and increasing ACCESS for adult patients referred for psychiatric treatment by their PCPs; Hypotheses: Compared to care in the 'usual care" arm, care in the ATP arm will: H1: be more cost effective than "usual care" arm as measured by comprehensive economic data that will be collected from patient, provider, and payor perspectives. H2: produce shorter wait‐times for appointment and consultation feedback as measured by comprehensive efficiency data that will be collected from patient, provider, and payor perspectives.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Collaborative care for depression in primary care settings is effective and cost‐effective. However, there is minimal evidence to support the choice of on‐site versus off‐site models. This study examined the cost‐effectiveness of on‐site practice‐based collaborative care (PBCC) versus off‐site telemedicine‐based collaborative care (TBCC) for depression in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). METHODS: In a multisite, randomized, pragmatic comparative cost‐effectiveness trial, 19,285 patients were screened for depression, 2,863 (14.8%) screened positive, and 364 were enrolled. Telephone interview data were collected at baseline and at six, 12, and 18 months. Base case analysis used Arkansas FQHC health care costs, and secondary analysis used national cost estimates. Effectiveness measures were depression‐free days and quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from depression‐free days, the 12‐Item Short‐Form Survey, and the Quality of Well‐Being (QWB) Scale. Nonparametric bootstrap with replacement methods were used to generate an empirical joint distribution of incremental costs and QALYs and acceptability curves. RESULTS: The TBCC intervention resulted in more depression‐free days and QALYs but at a greater cost than the PBCC intervention. The disease‐specific (depression‐free day) and generic (QALY) incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were below their respective ICER thresholds for implementation, suggesting that the TBCC intervention was more cost effective than the PBCC intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the cost‐effectiveness of TBCC in medically underserved primary care settings. Information about whether to insource (make) or outsource (buy) depression care management is important, given the current interest in patient‐centered medical homes, value‐based purchasing, and bundled payments for depression care.

AB: Objective: Pain and depression are prevalent and treatable symptoms among patients with cancer, yet they are often undetected and undertreated. The Indiana Cancer Pain and Depression (INCPAD) trial demonstrated that telecare management can improve pain and depression outcomes. This article investigates the incremental cost effectiveness of the INCPAD intervention. Methods: The INCPAD trial was conducted in 16 community‐based urban and rural oncology practices in Indiana. Of the 405 participants, 202 were randomized to the intervention group and 203 to the usual‐care group. Intervention costs were determined, and effectiveness outcomes were depression‐free days and quality‐adjusted life years. Results: The intervention group was associated with a yearly increase of 60.3 depression‐free days (S.E.= 15.4; P<. 0.01) and an increase of between 0.033 and 0.066 quality‐adjusted life years compared to the usual care group. Total cost of the intervention per patient was US$1189, which included physician, nurse care manager and automated monitoring set‐up and maintenance costs. Incremental cost per depression‐free day was US$19.72, which yields a range of US$18,018 to US$36,035 per quality‐adjusted life year when converted to that metric. When measured directly, the incremental cost per quality‐adjusted life year ranged from US$10,826 based on the modified EQ‐5D to US$73,286.92 based on the SF‐12. Conclusion: Centralized telecare management, coupled with automated symptom monitoring, appears to be a cost effective intervention for managing pain and depression in cancer patients.

AB: Objectives: The clinical effectiveness of Motiva Monitor platform was established in the previous study (TEN‐HMS). Patients randomly assigned to receive Usual Care had higher one year mortality (45%) than patients assigned to receive Nurse Telephone Support (27%) or Home Telemonitoring (29%) (p= 0.032). Our intention is to provide insights in the cost‐effectiveness of Motiva telehealth system by modeling the intervention and running the analysis on top of the reported data. Methods: Effectiveness was established by mining the EuroQol‐5D from the original database, while the information on costs came from the literature and the manufacturer of the equipment. Direct healthcare costs considered ER visits, GP, Specialist, Hospitalist and Nurse time and resources utilization. The induced (indirect) costs were not considered in the analysis. The approximation of the cost of medical consumption came from the Netherlands only, although the original study was run in three European countries. We assumed the payer perspective for our analysis. Results: The results clearly show, within the parameters of our model, the increased effectiveness of Home Telemonitoring and Nurse Telephone Support in comparison to the Usual Care. The deterministic results show ICERs of 14.842 and 12.547 per QALY (discounted at 1.5% a year) for HTM and NTS respectfully. Probabilistic results show that NTS was the most effective strategy in health systems that pay more than 12.500 per QALY. In the subgroup analysis HTM dominated both NTS and UC at the threshold of 16.500 in NYHA IV group of Chronic Heart Failure patients. Conclusions: Home telemonitoring by Motiva Monitor system reduces mortality and lowers the in‐hospital length of stay. On the quality of life dimensions, Home Telemonitoring was similarly effective as the Nurse Telephone Support, but with more costs. The cost‐effectiveness analysis shows that both NTS and HTM dominate the Usual Care at WTP of 15.000.

SO: Http://www.who.int/trialsearch/trial2.aspx? Trialid=actrn12613000921785
YR: 2013
AB: INTERVENTION: Initial profiling of subjects to determine incremental risk of rehospitalisation or death using the Green Amber Red Delineation of Individual risk And Need in Heart Failure (GARDIAN‐HF) tool. Based on subject location (metropolitan or remote dwelling) and GARDIAN‐HF profiling, subjects will be exposed to a more intensive, nurse‐led management program (including incremental face‐to‐face visits and structured telephone support), and monitoring of BNP levels using a point of care machine (for those aged younger than 75 years at the date of index hospitalisation) for a minimum of 12 months post index discharge. Active surveillance and management will continue for a minimum of 12 months for major endpoint analyses and then up to 5 years to determine the longer‐term effects of the study intervention. The incremental face‐to‐face visits include a full physical assessment (i.e. lying and standing blood pressure, pulse, heart sounds, oedema, etc), symptom assessment (i.e. NYHA class, dyspnoea and appetite/evidence of cachexia or malnutrition), and compliance with clinical monitoring and self‐management (i.e. daily weighs, fluid intake assessment, and medication adherence), ongoing HF self‐management education, assessment of self‐care behaviours (i.e. attendance to GP/ Cardiologist, emotional levels, immunisation status and health‐related quality of life) and a plan of future care including medication titration and ordering of further tests (i.e. pathology, x‐ray), in consultation with the individuals health care team, communication with GP, and/or referral to community services or allied health professionals. The structured telephone support includes a range of pre‐determined questions including presence of symptoms (shortness of breath, or weight increase), length of symptoms, and maintenance of low sodium diet and fluid restriction. The individuals who are randomly allocated into the intensive management arm of the study will receive at least two home visits throughout the initial 12 month follow‐up period. All intensive management patients will also receive weekly to monthly structured telephone support by the National Heart Foundation of Australia (NHFA). Those participants who are designated into standard care and live remotely from the hospital (i.e. greater than 30km’s from the recruitment site) will receive monthly structured telephone support from the NHFA. Each home visit will take a minimum of 60 minutes. The initial structured telephone support call will take approximately 20 minutes for the initial call and approximately 8 minutes for each call thereafter. Detailed reports of initial profiling and management will be sent to the subject's heath care team (i.e. GP) utilising the GARDIAN‐HF tool. CONDITION: Heart Failure PRIMARY OUTCOME: Total cost of health care (calculated as cost/day per subject). Assessed via linked data from hospital/death records, GP follow‐up and participant feedback. SECONDARY OUTCOME: All‐cause mortality. Assessed via linked data from the local death registry. ; Change in health‐related quality of life from baseline to 12 months: ; ; Generic (AQoL‐8D) and; ; Heart failure specific (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire) Event‐free survival from all‐cause death or hospitalisation ‐ measured as both a dichotomous variable (yes or no) and expressed as days alive and out‐of‐hospital. ; ; Assessed via linked data from hospital/death records, GP follow‐up and participant feedback. Pattern of gold‐standard therapy (including prescribed doses of angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and beta blockers) relative to expert guidelines for the management of chronic heart failure. ; ; Assessed during the clinic visit at the 12 month time‐point via medical records, GP records, and patient review. Prolonged follow‐up of event‐free survival from all‐cause death or hospitalisation ‐ measured as both a dichotomous variable (yes or no) and expressed as days alive and out‐of‐hospital. ; ; Assessed via linked data from hospital/death records, GP follow‐up and participant feedback. Rate of hospitalisation (all‐cause, unplanned, CVD and CHF‐specific) both in respect to hospital episodes and associated length of stay. This is measured as events per patient per 100 days. ; ; Australia‐refined Diagnostic Related Groupings (AR‐DRGs) will be used to standardise and categorise each hospital readmission into fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are those that all surviving patients incur irrespective of their length of stay, whilst variable costs are a per diem (i.e. medical and nursing staff) cost and are dependent on the length of stay. The total costs are the variable costs multiplied by the length of stay plus the fixed cost. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Individuals discharged to home following an admission to a participating hospital will be eligible for study randomisation if they: 1) have a diagnosis of chronic heart failure and 2) a history of 1 or more admissions to hospital with acute HF (including the index hospitalisation).

AB: Background: Compliance with CPAP therapy is essential in patients with OSA but an adequate control is not always possible. This is of clinical importance as CPAP reverses OSA morbidity and mortality. Alternative and more cost‐effective approaches are needed. A telemedicine‐based strategy could be of great interest. Methods: One hundred thirty nine patients were randomized in a controlled trial that was performed to compare a telemedicine‐based strategy for CPAP follow‐up (patients' support based on a web platform support and videoconferences) with the standard face‐to‐face control. Main outcomes were CPAP compliance and cost‐effectiveness (Bayesian analysis). Secondary outcomes: Quality of life (QoL), satisfaction and secondary effects questionaries. Results: At six months, similar levels of CPAP compliance, improvement in sleepiness, QoL, side effects and degree of satisfaction were found in both groups. Despite observing more extra visits, the telemedicine group was more cost‐effective: costs were lower and difference in effectiveness was not relevant. Discussion: A telemedicine‐based strategy for the follow‐up of OSA patients under CPAP treatment proved to be as effective as the standard hospital‐based care in terms of CPAP compliance and improvement. Cost‐effectiveness analysis showed that the telemedicine‐based strategy presented lower total costs due to savings on transport and indirect costs of productivity losses.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative impact of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) on use and costs of health care within the Look AHEAD trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 5,121 overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to an ILI that promoted weight loss or to a comparison condition of diabetes support and education (DSE). Use and costs of health‐care services were recorded across an average of 10 years. RESULTS: ILI led to reductions in annual hospitalizations (11%, P = 0.004), hospital days (15%, P = 0.01), and number of medications (6%, P < 0.001), resulting in cost savings for hospitalization (10%, P = 0.04) and medication (7%, P < 0.001). ILI produced a mean relative per‐person 10‐year cost savings of $5,280 (95% CI 3,385‐7,175); however, these were not evident among individuals with a history of cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with DSE over 10 years, ILI participants had fewer hospitalizations, fewer medications, and lower health‐care costs.

AB: Background: Evidence that home telemonitoring (HTM) for patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) offers clinical beneft over usual care is controversial as is evidence of a health economic advantage. Therefore the CardioBBEAT trial was designed to prospectively assess the health economic impact of a dedicated home monitoring system for patients with CHF based on actual costs directly obtained from patients' health care providers. Methods: Between January 2010 and June 2013, 621 patients (mean age 63,0 ± 11,5 years, 88 % male) with a confrmed diagnosis of CHF (LVEF ≤ 40 %) were enrolled and randomly assigned to two study groups comprising usual care with and without an interactive bi‐directional HTM (Motiva®). The primary endpoint was the Incremental Cost‐Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) established by the groups' difference in total cost and in the combined clinical endpoint "days alive and not in hospital nor inpatient care per potential days in study" within the follow up of 12 months. Secondary outcome measures were total mortality and health related quality of life (SF‐36, WHO‐5 and KCCQ). Results: In the intention‐to‐treat analysis, total mortality (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.45 ‐ 1.45) and days alive and not in hospital (343.3 ± 55.4 vs. 347.2 ± 43.9; p = 0.909) were not signifcantly different between HTM and usual care. While the resulting primary endpoint ICER was not positive (‐181.9; 95% CI ‐1626.2 ± 1628.9), quality of life assessed by SF‐36, WHO‐5 and KCCQ as a secondary endpoint was signifcantly higher in the HTW group at 6 and 12 months of follow‐up. Conclusions: The frst simultaneous assessment of clinical and economic outcome of HTM in patients with CHF did not demonstrate superior incremental cost effectiveness compared to usual care. On the other hand, quality of life was improved. It remains open whether the tested HTM solution represents a useful innovative approach in the recent health care setting.

AB: Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a prevalent disease with significant morbidity resulting in long waiting lists and high health care costs. Therefore, alternative cost‐effective approaches are urgently needed. A possible procedure is telemedicine based on ICT. Objectives: The primary objective was implementing an ICT‐based out‐of‐hospital management of OSA to be compared with the classical in‐hospital management. Other aims were: procedure cost‐effectiveness, compliance, patient satisfaction and clinical and physiological improvement. Methods: We set a 3‐month randomized study with parallel groups for inclusion of a total of 168 patients with suspicion of OSA derived to our Sleep Unit. Exclusion criteria are subjects unable to use Smartphone, unstable diseases or severe hypersomnia. Patients are randomized in two groups; 1) classical in‐hospital group: polysomnograph, respiratory polygraphy (RP) or home respiratory polygraphy (HRP), CPAP titration and treatment and hospital follow‐up; and 2) ICT group: 3 consecutive HRPs, automatic CPAP treatment and control by phono/video conferences and data transmission by using a custom designed platform. Results: The feasibility and satisfaction of the physicians/patients in the first 17 patients (Age: 48,9±14yr, ESS: 10,9±5, AHI: 17,8±9) was good. One out of the 9 ICT group patients dropped out at follow‐up. Conclusions: This initial trial data suggest that the ICT strategy will contribute to development of costeffective procedures for OSA management, with patients and physicians satisfaction.

AB: Introduction: Following a cardiac event it is recommended that cardiac patients participate in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs. However, little is known about the relative cost‐effectiveness of lifestyle‐related interventions for cardiac patients. This study aimed to compare the cost‐effectiveness of a telephone‐delivered Healthy Weight intervention to a telephone‐delivered Physical Activity intervention for patients referred to CR in urban and rural Australia. Methods: A cost‐utility analysis was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial of the two interventions. Outcomes were measured as Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained. Results: The estimated cost of delivering the interventions was $201.48 per Healthy Weight participant and $138.00 per Physical Activity participant. The average total cost (cost of health care utilisation plus patient costs) was $1,260 per Healthy Weight participant and $2,112 per Physical Activity participant, a difference of $852 in favour of the Healthy Weight intervention. Healthy Weight participants gained an average of 0.007 additional QALYs than did Physical Activity participants. Thus, overall the Healthy Weight intervention dominated the Physical Activity intervention (Healthy Weight intervention was less costly and more effective than the Physical Activity intervention). Subgroup analyses showed the Healthy Weight intervention also dominated the Physical Activity intervention for rural participants and for participants who did not attend CR. Conclusions: The low‐contact pedometer‐based telephone coaching Healthy Weight intervention is overall both less costly and more effective compared to the Physical Activity intervention, including for rural cardiac patients and patients that do not attend CR.

AB: Background: Regular outpatient follow‐up programmes are usually offered to patients following treatment for gynaecological and other cancers. Despite the substantial resources involved in providing these programmes, there is evidence that routine follow‐up programmes do not affect survival or the likelihood of detecting recurrence and may not meet patient needs. Alternative follow‐up modalities may offer the same outcomes at lower cost. We examined the costs of using telephone‐based routine follow‐up of women treated for endometrial cancer undertaken by specialist gynaecology oncology nurses in comparison to routine hospital‐based follow‐up. Methods: The ENDCAT trial randomised 259 women at five centres in the north west of England with a known diagnosis of Stage I endometrial cancer who had completed primary treatment on a 1:1 basis to receive either standard hospital outpatient follow‐up or a telephone follow‐up intervention administered by specialist nurses. A cost‐consequence analysis was undertaken in which we compared costs to the health system and to individuals with the trial’s co‐primary outcomes of psychological morbidity and participant satisfaction with information received. Results: Psychological morbidity, psychosocial needs, patient satisfaction and quality of life did not differ between arms. Patients randomised to telephone follow‐up underwent more and longer consultations. There was no difference in total health service mean per patient costs at 6 months (mean difference £8, 95% percentile confidence interval: − £147 to £141) or 12 months (mean difference: − £77, 95% percentile confidence interval: − £334 to £154). Estimated return journey costs per patient for hospital consultations were £11.47. Productivity costs were approximately twice as high under hospital follow‐up. Conclusion: Telephone follow‐up was estimated to be cost‐neutral for the NHS and may free up clinic time for other patients. There was some evidence that telephone follow‐up may be more efficient for patients and wider society, and is not associated with additional psychological morbidity, lower patient satisfaction or reduced quality of life.

AB: BACKGROUND: The feasibility of telemedicine in diagnosing and treating nonacute headaches, such as primary headaches (migraine and tension‐type) and medication‐overuse headaches has not been previously investigated. By eliminating the need of travel to specialists, telemedicine may offer significant time and money savings. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to estimate the acceptance of telemedicine and investigate the feasibility and cost savings of telemedicine consultations in diagnosing and treating nonacute headaches. METHODS: From September 2012 to March 2015, nonacute headache patients from Northern Norway who were referred to neurologists through an electronic application system were consecutively screened and randomized to participate in either telemedicine or traditional specialist visits. All patients were consulted by two neurologists at the neurological department in Tromsø University Hospital. Feasibility outcomes were compared between telemedicine and traditional groups. Baseline characteristics and costs were then compared between rural and urban patients. Travel costs were calculated by using the probabilistic method of the Norwegian traveling agency: the cheapest means of public transport for each study participant. Loss of pay was calculated based on the Norwegian full‐time employee's average salary: < 3.5 hours=a half day's salary, > 3.5 hours spent on travel and consultation=one day's salary. Distance and time spent on travel were estimated by using Google Maps. RESULTS: Of 557 headache patients screened, 479 were found eligible and 402 accepted telemedicine participation (83.9%, 402/479) and were included in the final analyses. Of these, 202 received traditional specialist consultations and 200 received telemedicine. All patients in the telemedicine group were satisfied with the video quality, and 198 (99%, 198/200) were satisfied with the sound quality. The baseline characteristics as well as headache diagnostics and follow‐up appointments, and the investigation, advice, and prescription practices were not statistically different between the two randomized groups. In addition, telemedicine consultations were shorter than traditional visits (38.8 vs 43.7 min, P<.001). The travel cost per rural individual (292/402, 73%) was €249, and estimated lost income was €234 per visit. The travel cost in the urban area (110/402, 27%) was €6, and estimated lost income was €117 per visit. The median traveling distance for rural patients was 526 km (range 1892 km), and the median traveling time was 7.8 hours (range 27.3 hours). Rural patients had a longer waiting time than urban patients (64 vs 47 days, P=.001), and fewer women were referred from rural areas (P=.04). Rural women reported higher pain scores than urban women (P=.005). CONCLUSION: Our study shows that telemedicine is an accepted, feasible, time‐saving, and cost‐saving alternative to traditional specialist consultations for nonacute headaches.

AB: OBJECTIVE: This "proof of concept" study aimed to assess the cost effectiveness of pharmacists giving advice via telephone, to patients receiving a new medicine for a chronic condition, in England. METHODS: The self‐regulatory model (SRM) theory was used to guide development of our intervention and used in training pharmacists to adopt a patient‐centred approach. Non‐adherence to new medicines for chronic conditions develops rapidly so we developed a study intervention in which a pharmacist telephoned patients two weeks after they had started a new medicine for a chronic condition. Patients were included if they were 75 or older, or were suffering from stroke, cardiovascular disease, asthma, diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis, and were randomized into treatment or control arms. Main outcome measures were non‐adherence and cost to the UK NHS, obtained via a questionnaire sent two months after starting therapy. Cost of the intervention was also included. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were generated. RESULTS: Five hundred patients were recruited. At 4‐week follow‐up, non‐adherence was significantly lower in the intervention group (9% vs 16%, p=0.032). The number of patients reporting medicine‐related problems was significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control, (23% vs 34% p=0.021). Mean total patient costs at 2‐month follow‐up (median, range) were intervention: pound sterling 187.7 (40.6, 4.2‐2484.3); control: pound sterling 282.8 (42, 0‐3804) (p<0.0001). The intervention was dominant (less costly and more effective). If the decision maker is not willing to pay anything for one extra adherent patient, there is still a 90% probability that the intervention is cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that pharmacists can meet patients' needs for information and advice on medicines, soon after starting treatment. While a larger trial is needed to confirm that the effect is real and sustained, these initial findings suggest the study intervention may be effective, at least in the short term, with a reduced overall cost to the health provider.

AB: Objective To investigate the cost‐effectiveness of a modified form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for recurrent non‐cardiac chest pain. Methods We tested the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of a modified form of CBT for chest pain (CBT‐CP)(4‐10 sessions) in patients who attended cardiology clinics or emergency medical services repeatedly. Patients were randomised using a remote web‐based system to CBT‐CP or to standard care in the clinic. Assessments were made at baseline and at 6 months and 12 months. The primary outcome was the change in the Health Anxiety Inventory Score at 6 months. Other clinical measures, social functioning, quality of life and costs of services were also recorded. Results Sixty‐eight patients were randomised with low attrition rates at 6 months and 12 months with 81% of all possible assessments completed at 6 months and 12 months. Although there were no significant group differences between any of the outcome measures at either 6 months or 12 months, patients receiving CBT‐CP had between two and three times fewer hospital bed days, outpatient appointments, and A&E attendances than those allocated to standard care and total costs per patient were £1496.49 lower, though the differences in costs were not significant. There was a small non‐significant gain in quality adjusted life years in those allocated to CBT‐CP compared with standard care (0.76 vs 0.74). Conclusions It is concluded that CBT‐CP in the context of current hospital structures is not a viable treatment, but is worthy of further research as a potentially cost‐effective treatment for non‐cardiac chest pain.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost‐effectiveness of a telehealthcare solution in addition to usual care compared with usual care. DESIGN: A 12‐month cost‐utility analysis conducted alongside a cluster‐randomised trial. SETTING: Community‐based setting in the geographical area of North Denmark Region in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 26 municipality districts define randomisation clusters with 13 districts in each arm. 1225 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were enrolled, of which 578 patients were randomised to telehealthcare and 647 to usual care. INTERVENTIONS: In addition to usual care, patients in the intervention group received a set of telehealthcare equipment and were monitored by a municipality‐based healthcare team. Patients in the control group received usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental costs per quality‐adjusted life‐years gained from baseline up to 12 months follow‐up. RESULTS: From a healthcare and social sector perspective, the adjusted mean difference in total costs between telehealthcare and usual care was €728 (95% CI ‐754 to 2211) and the adjusted mean difference in quality‐adjusted life‐years gained was 0.0132 (95% CI ‐0.0083 to 0.0346). The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio was €55 327 per quality‐adjusted life‐year gained. Decision‐makers should be willing to pay more than €55 000 to achieve a probability of cost‐effectiveness >50%. This conclusion is robust to changes in the definition of hospital contacts and reduced intervention costs. Only in the most optimistic scenario combining the effects of all sensitivity analyses, does the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio fall below the UK thresholds values (€21 068 per quality‐adjusted life‐year). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealthcare is unlikely to be a cost‐effective addition to usual care, if it is offered to all patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and if the willingness‐to‐pay threshold values from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence are applied.

AB: BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a burdensome condition for individuals to live with and an increasingly costly condition for health services to treat. Cost‐effective treatment strategies are required to delay the onset and slow the progression of diabetes related complications. The Diabetes Telephone Coaching Study (DTCS) demonstrated that telephone coaching is an intervention that may improve the risk factor status and diabetes management practices of people with T2DM. Measuring the cost effectiveness of this intervention is important to inform funding decisions that may facilitate the translation of this research into clinical practice. The purpose of this study is to assess the cost‐effectiveness of telephone coaching, compared to usual diabetes care, in participants with poorly controlled T2DM. METHODS: A cost utility analysis was undertaken using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model to extrapolate outcomes collected at 6 months in the DTCS over a 10 year time horizon. The intervention's impact on life expectancy, quality‐adjusted life expectancy (QALE) and costs was estimated. Costs were reported from a health system perspective. A 5 % discount rate was applied to all future costs and effects. One‐way sensitivity analyses were conducted to reflect uncertainty surrounding key input parameters. RESULTS: The intervention dominated the control condition in the base‐case analysis, contributing to cost savings of $3327 per participant, along with non‐significant improvements in QALE (0.2 QALE) and life expectancy (0.3 years). CONCLUSIONS: The cost of delivering the telephone coaching intervention continuously, for 10 years, was fully recovered through cost savings and a trend towards net health benefits. Findings of cost savings and net health benefits are rare and should prove attractive to decision makers who will determine whether this intervention is implemented into clinical practice.

AB: BACKGROUND: Compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is essential in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), but adequate control is not always possible. This is clinically important because CPAP can reverse the morbidity and mortality associated with OSA. Telemedicine, with support provided via a web platform and video conferences, could represent a cost‐effective alternative to standard care management. AIM: To assess the telemedicine impact on treatment compliance, cost‐effectiveness and improvement in quality of life (QoL) when compared with traditional face‐to‐face follow‐up. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was performed to compare a telemedicine‐based CPAP follow‐up strategy with standard face‐to‐face management. Consecutive OSA patients requiring CPAP treatment, with sufficient internet skills and who agreed to participate, were enrolled. They were followed‐up at 1, 3 and 6 months and answered surveys about sleep, CPAP side effects and lifestyle. We compared CPAP compliance, cost‐effectiveness and QoL between the beginning and the end of the study. A Bayesian cost‐effectiveness analysis with non‐informative priors was performed. RESULTS: We randomised 139 patients. At 6 months, we found similar levels of CPAP compliance, and improved daytime sleepiness, QoL, side effects and degree of satisfaction in both groups. Despite requiring more visits, the telemedicine group was more cost‐effective: costs were lower and differences in effectiveness were not relevant. CONCLUSIONS: A telemedicine‐based strategy for the follow‐up of CPAP treatment in patients with OSA was as effective as standard hospital‐based care in terms of CPAP compliance and symptom improvement, with comparable side effects and satisfaction rates. The telemedicine‐based strategy had lower total costs due to savings on transport and less lost productivity (indirect costs). TRIAL REGISTER NUMBER: NCT01716676.

AB: Introduction: Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) has recently been demonstrated to improve long‐term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and elective or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). The therapy can be applied in a simple, low cost manner with a device performing cycles of alternating inflation and deflation of a blood‐pressure cuff. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of RIC as an adjunct to pPCI in patients with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) from the perspective of a Danish health care system. Methods: Between February 2007‐November 2008, 251 patients with STEMI were randomised during ambulance transport to the hospital for pPCI with (n=126) or without (n=125) RIC. Patients were followed until death or January 2012. Data on cardiac readmissions, cardiac outpatient contacts, and use of car diovascular medications were collected from Danish nationwide registries. Medical care costs were calculated using an event‐based method. The effectiveness of the therapy was evaluated as major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE)‐free survival. Results: At 4 year of follow‐up, the cumulative medical care costs were Euro () 2896 [95% confidence interval (CI): 113‐5679] lower per patient in the RIC group compared with the control group (12404 vs. 15300), and cumulative life‐years of MACCE‐free survival were 0.31 years (95% CI: 0.30‐0.60) higher per patient in the RIC group compared with the control group (3.66 vs. 3.35 years). Difference in medical care costs and MACCE‐free survival based on bootstrap replications are plotted on the cost‐effectiveness plane (Figure 1). p Conclusion: Remote ischaemic conditioning as an adjunct to pPCI is a costeffective strategy in patients with STEMI.

AB: Background: Depression is a common, debilitating and costly disorder. The best‐evidenced psychological therapy‐cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT)‐is complex and costly. A simpler therapy, behavioural activation (BA), may be an effective alternative. Objectives: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of BA compared with CBT for depressed adults at 12 and 18 months' follow‐up, and to investigate the processes of treatments. Design: Randomised controlled, non‐inferiority trial stratified by depression severity, antidepressant use and recruitment site, with embedded process evaluation; and randomisation by remote computer‐generated allocation. Setting: Three community mental health services in England. Participants: Adults aged >= 18 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) recruited from primary care and psychological therapy services. Interventions: BA delivered by NHS junior mental health workers (MHWs); CBT by NHS psychological therapists. Outcomes: Primary: Depression severity (as measured via the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9; PHQ‐9) at 12 months. Secondary: MDD status; number of depression‐free days; anxiety (as measured via the Generalised Anxiety Disorder‐7); health‐related quality of life (as measured via the Short Form questionnaire‐36 items) at 6, 12 and 18 months; and PHQ‐9 at 6 and 18 months, all collected by assessors blinded to treatment allocation. Non‐inferiority margin was 1.9 PHQ‐9 points. We undertook intention‐to‐treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses. We explored cost‐effectiveness by collecting direct treatment and other health‐and social‐care costs and calculating quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) using the EuroQol‐5 Dimensions, three‐level version, at 18 months. Results: We recruited 440 participants (BA, n = 221; CBT, n = 219); 175 (79%) BA and 189 (86%) CBT participants provided ITT data and 135 (61%) BA and 151 (69%) CBT participants provided PP data. At 12 months we found that BA was non‐inferior to CBT {ITT: CBT 8.4 PHQ‐9 points [standard deviation (SD) 7.5 PHQ‐9 points], BA 8.4 PHQ‐9 points (SD 7.0 PHQ‐9 points), mean difference 0.1 PHQ‐9 points, 95% confidence interval (CI)‐1.3 to 1.5 PHQ‐9 points, p = 0.89; PP: CBT 7.9 PHQ‐9 points (SD 7.3 PHQ‐9 points), BA 7.8 PHQ‐9 points (SD 6.5 PHQ‐9 points), mean difference 0.0 PHQ‐9 points, 95% CI‐1.5 to 1.6 PHQ‐9 points, p = 0.99}. We found no differences in secondary outcomes. We found a significant difference in mean intervention costs (BA, 975; CBT, 1235; p < 0.001), but no differences in non‐intervention (hospital, community health, social care and medication costs) or total (non‐intervention plus intervention) costs. Costs were lower and QALY outcomes better in the BA group, generating an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio of‐6865. The probability of BA being cost‐effective compared with CBT was almost 80% at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's preferred willingness‐to‐pay threshold of 20,000‐30,000 per QALY. There were no trial‐related adverse events. Limitations: In this pragmatic trial many depressed participants in both groups were also taking antidepressant medication, although most had been doing so for a considerable time before entering the trial. Around one‐third of participants chose not to complete a PP dose of treatment, a finding common in both psychotherapy trials and routine practice. Conclusions: We found that BA is as effective as CBT, more cost‐effective and can be delivered by MHWs with no professional training in psychological therapies.

AB: Background‐Both supervised exercise (SE) and stenting (ST) improve functional status, symptoms, and quality of life compared with optimal medical care (OMC) in patients with claudication. The relative cost‐effectiveness of these strategies is not well defined. Methods and Results‐The Claudication: Exercise Versus Endoluminal Revascularization (CLEVER) study randomized patients with claudication due to aortoiliac stenosis to a 6‐month SE program, to ST, or to OMC. Participants who completed 6‐month follow‐up (n=98) were included in a health economic analysis through 18 months. Costs were assessed using resource‐based methods and hospital billing data. Quality‐adjusted life‐years were estimated using the EQ‐5D. Markov modeling based on the in‐trial results was used to explore the impact of assumptions about the longer term durability of observed differences in quality of life. Through 18 months, mean healthcare costs were $5178, $9804, and $14 590 per patient for OMC, SE, and ST, respectively. Measured quality‐adjusted life‐years through 18 months were 1.04, 1.16, and 1.20. In our base case analysis, which assumed that observed differences in quality of life would dissipate after 5 years, the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios were $24 070 per quality adjusted life‐year gained for SE versus OMC, $41 376 for ST versusOMC, and $122 600 for ST versus SE. If the treatment effect of ST was assumed to be more durable than that of SE, the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio for ST versus SE became more favorable. Conclusions‐Both SE and ST are economically attractive by US standards relative to OMC for the treatment of claudication in patients with aortoiliac disease. ST is more expensive than SE, with uncertain incremental benefit.

Participants who completed 6‐month follow‐up (n=98) were included in a health economic analysis through 18 months. Costs were assessed using resource‐based methods and hospital billing data. Quality‐adjusted life‐years were estimated using the EQ‐5D. Markov modeling based on the in‐trial results was used to explore the impact of assumptions about the longer term durability of observed differences in quality of life. Through 18 months, mean healthcare costs were $5178, $9804, and $14 590 per patient for OMC, SE, and ST, respectively. Measured quality‐adjusted life‐years through 18 months were 1.04, 1.16, and 1.20. In our base case analysis, which assumed that observed differences in quality of life would dissipate after 5 years, the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios were $24 070 per quality‐adjusted life‐year gained for SE versus OMC, $41 376 for ST versus OMC, and $122 600 for ST versus SE. If the treatment effect of ST was assumed to be more durable than that of SE, the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio for ST versus SE became more favorable. CONCLUSIONS: Both SE and ST are economically attractive by US standards relative to OMC for the treatment of claudication in patients with aortoiliac disease. ST is more expensive than SE, with uncertain incremental benefit. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov, Unique identifier: NCT00132743.

DOI: 10.1177/2396987316642910
AB: Background: Rationale: Recent trials showed that ambulances equipped with a computed tomography scanner, point‐of‐care laboratory and telemedicine support (Mobile Stroke Units, MSUs) reduce the onset‐to‐throm‐bolysis time and increase the rate of thrombolysis by 50%, as compared to usual stroke care. However, those studies were conducted before the demonstration of the benefit of thrombectomy/bridging therapy, and proof of improved long‐term outcome after MSU deployment is currently lacking. Besides, whether MSU represents a viable innovation in health‐economic dimensions is still uncertain. Methods: Aims: We hypothesized that compared to usual care, the deployment of a MSU would result in an incremental cost‐utility ratio (ICUR) <50,000 euros per QALY in the lifetime horizon. Results: Design: ASPHALT (Acute Stroke: Prehospital versus in‐HospitAL initiation of recanalization Therapy) is an academic‐driven, multicenter, open‐label randomized controlled trial of MSU deployment versus standard care, with blinded assessment of efficacy endpoints. Randomization will be performed on an individual patient basis. Three distinct geographic areas in France will be alternatively involved, over 6‐month periods. 450 acute ischemic stroke patients (emergency call <5 hours after onset) will be recruited over a 3‐year period, and followed one year. Costs and clinical outcomes including utilities will be collected prospectively during the study period and extrapolated over a lifetime horizon using a Markov model. Conclusions: Study outcomes: The primary endpoint is the ICUR, based on extrapolated results of the mRS and incremental costs at one year. Secondary endpoints include 3‐month and 6‐month mRS, ICUR at one and five years, proportion of patients undergoing reperfusion therapies, onset‐to‐treatment and alarm‐to‐treatment times.

AB: BACKGROUND: Depression is a common, debilitating and costly disorder. The best‐evidenced psychological therapy ‐ cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) ‐ is complex and costly. A simpler therapy, behavioural activation (BA), may be an effective alternative. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of BA compared with CBT for depressed adults at 12 and 18 months' follow‐up, and to investigate the processes of treatments. DESIGN: Randomised controlled, non‐inferiority trial stratified by depression severity, antidepressant use and recruitment site, with embedded process evaluation; and randomisation by remote computer‐generated allocation. SETTING: Three community mental health services in England. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged ≥ 18 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) recruited from primary care and psychological therapy services. INTERVENTIONS: BA delivered by NHS junior mental health workers (MHWs); CBT by NHS psychological therapists. OUTCOMES: Primary: depression severity (as measured via the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9; PHQ‐9) at 12 months. Secondary: MDD status; number of depression‐free days; anxiety (as measured via the Generalised Anxiety Disorder‐7); health‐related quality of life (as measured via the Short Form questionnaire‐36 items) at 6, 12 and 18 months; and PHQ‐9 at 6 and 18 months, all collected by assessors blinded to treatment allocation. Non‐inferiority margin was 1.9 PHQ‐9 points. We undertook intention‐to‐treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses. We explored cost‐effectiveness by collecting direct treatment and other health‐ and social‐care costs and calculating quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) using the EuroQol‐5 Dimensions, three‐level version, at 18 months. RESULTS: We recruited 440 participants (BA, n = 221; CBT, n = 219); 175 (79%) BA and 189 (86%) CBT participants provided ITT data and 135 (61%) BA and 151 (69%) CBT participants provided PP data. At 12 months we found that BA was non‐inferior to CBT {ITT: CBT 8.4 PHQ‐9 points [standard deviation (SD) 7.5 PHQ‐9 points], BA 8.4 PHQ‐9 points (SD 7.0 PHQ‐9 points), mean difference 0.1 PHQ‐9 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐1.3 to 1.5 PHQ‐9 points, p = 0.89; PP: CBT 7.9 PHQ‐9 points (SD 7.3 PHQ‐9 points), BA 7.8 PHQ‐9 points (SD 6.5 PHQ‐9 points), mean difference 0.0 PHQ‐9 points, 95% CI ‐1.5 to 1.6 PHQ‐9 points, p = 0.99}. We found no differences in secondary outcomes. We found a significant difference in mean intervention costs (BA, £975; CBT, £1235; p < 0.001), but no differences in non‐intervention (hospital, community health, social care and medication costs) or total (non‐intervention plus intervention) costs. Costs were lower and QALY outcomes better in the BA group, generating an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio of ‐£6865. The probability of BA being cost‐effective compared with CBT was almost 80% at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's preferred willingness‐to‐pay threshold of £20,000‐30,000 per QALY. There were no trial‐related adverse events. LIMITATIONS: In this pragmatic trial many depressed participants in both groups were also taking antidepressant medication, although most had been doing so for a considerable time before entering the trial. Around one‐third of participants chose not to complete a PP dose of treatment, a finding common in both psychotherapy trials and routine practice. CONCLUSIONS: We found that BA is as effective as CBT, more cost‐effective and can be delivered by MHWs with no professional training in psychological therapies. FUTURE WORK: Settings and countries with a paucity of professionally qualified psychological therapists, might choose to investigate the delivery of effective psychological therapy for depression without the need to develop an extensive and costly professional infrastructure.

AB: Objective: To study the impact of a long‐term telemonitoring program for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMT2), in three European regions (Berlin‐Germany, Thessaly‐Greece and Veneto‐Italy), on health‐related quality of life (QoL) and costs compared to usual care. Methods: 823 patients with DMT2, HbA1c > 53 mmol/mol (7.0% NGSP), were randomly assigned in the telemonitoring (I), (N = 555) and the control (C), (N = 268) group. In the (I) HbA1c levels were collected weekly via a telemonitoring device, for a period of one year. Allocated health professionals provided by phone counseling on lifestyle and medication adjustments, whenever required. Patients in (C) received usual care with faceto‐ face consultations. QoL was assessed using a generic (SF36v2) questionnaire and SF‐6D was used to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in the cost‐utility analysis. (registration NCT01498367/NCT01569893) Results: The meta‐analysis revealed that the mean differences in the SF36v2 Physical Component Scale (CS) (0.23) and the Mental CS (0.30) were not statistically significant [95%CI ‐ 1.32,1.77 and ‐ 6.37,6.96, respectively]. Only the sub group of patients with a mean age of 58.28 years in Greece, showed a statistically significant health utility increase in (I) [0.11, p = 0.000] and the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated [e5,460.11 per QALY] indicated that even though telemedicine is more expensive it is a cost‐effective choice for the Greek national health system. Conclusion: The study revealed that the impact of telemedicine implementation varies among age groups due to different treatment objectives, and among health systems due to differences in wages and prices for the telemedicine equipment.

AB: This PhD study evaluates the effect of an information technology solution containing RRS. The way it supports, informs and educates the patient and support person, provides an opportunity for communication between the patient and the surgeons, physiotherapists and nurses at the hospital. The parameters evaluated will be: Length of stay, health‐related quality‐of‐life (HRQOL), functional outcome, pain, anxiety, complications and an evaluation of the socio‐economic effect. The aim of the study generates the following hypotheses and focus for publication ‐ Length of stay is lower for the intervention group compared to the control group. ‐ The average quality of life measured with EQ‐5D will either be the same or higher when comparing the intervention group with the control group. ‐ Compared to the control group the functional outcome of the intervention group measured with Oxford Hip Score (OHS) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) will be the same or better. ‐ Complications measured as luxations, infections, and reoperations are the same or lower in the intervention group compared to the control group. ‐ There will be a correlation between patients with the highest level of psychological problems and symptoms of psychopathology measured with Symptom Checklist‐90‐R, and the postoperative outcome measured with EQ5D, anxiety and TUG. ‐ There will be a correlation between support persons with the highest level of psychological problems and symptoms of psychopathology measured with Symptom Checklist‐90‐R, and the postoperative outcome measured with EQ5D, anxiety and TUG for the patient they are related to. ‐ The socio‐economic costs will be lower for the intervention group compared to the control group based on self reported data and data collected from official databases. This study will be conducted as a piggy back to the RCT.

AB: Background: Virtual monitoring is emerging as an alternative model for health care delivery to optimise usage of limited resources. However, nurse‐led telemonitoring (NLT) as a complement to current models of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) care have not been examined yet. Aims: To examine the safety, feasibility and cost‐effectiveness of NLT as a complement to CHB standard care. Methods: This is an ongoing two‐arm randomised controlled trial with a follow up duration of 2 years. One group received standard care (SC) and the other received standard care alternating with nurse‐led virtual hepatitis B monitoring service (NHMS). In the NHMS group, trained nurse‐clinicians monitored and communicated patient blood test results by phone. Safety was assessed by incidence rate of LC, HCC, and raised ALT requiring medications (ALTm) and failure to detect these clinical events. Feasibility was assessed by patient compliance with CHB monitoring, patient experience and acceptance of this model of care. Cost‐effectiveness was assessed by changes in transport cost, waiting time and days of sick leave for CHB care. Data were obtained from electronic health records and administered questionnaires. Results: 333 clinically stable CHB patients were recruited (mean±SD age: 56.1±12.8 years; Females: 54.9%; Chinese: 97.9%), of whom 121 (36.3%) have completed the follow‐up. Baseline mean±SD of ALT, Albumin and AFP were 23.83±10.37IU/mL, 42.40±2.75g/L and 2.73±1.82ng/mL respectively. Among patients who completed the follow‐up, no significant differences were observed in the incidence rates of LC, HCC and ALTm between both arms (1.7% vs 2.1%; 1.7% vs 0.0%; 5.0% vs 5.9% respectively, all p=1.000). All clinical events were detected during clinical or virtual visit. Statistically significant (p<0.05) differences were observed in the change of total transport costs and waiting time in the NHMS group compared to SC (median ‐S$3.04 vs S$0.40, ‐120 minutes vs ‐45 minutes respectively. No significant difference (p>0.05) was seen in compliance with CHB‐related appointments and the number of sick leave days taken for CHB care between both arms (both median 100.00% and 0.00 days respectively). 82.6% of the patients in the NHMS group opined that NHMS was better than SC and 85.2% would prefer the NHMS model of care if given a choice. Conclusion: The data suggests that specialist care alternating with telemonitoring by nurse‐clinicians for stable CHB patients is a safe, feasible and cost‐effective complement to standard care as it significantly reduces transportation costs and waiting time while maintaining the level of patient safety and optimising specialist care resources.

TI: Evaluation of the AUTONOM@DOM Telemonitoring System for People With Heart Failure
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02135458
YR: 2014
KY: Heart Failure
AB: Chronic diseases such as heart failure are a major burden for healthcare systems They are punctuated by exacerbations, often markers of poor prognosis, and are associated with expensive unscheduled hospitalizations. After initial diagnosis, despite the development of both drug and physical therapies, the rate of re‐hospitalization for heart failure remains high with 50% or more of patients readmitted within 6 months. Recommendations for the treatment of heart failure patients are extremely precise and justify close collaboration between local community services and the hospital. However there is often considerable divergence between recommended care and the reality, due in particular to the difficulty in monitoring ambulatory patients. For example, the dose titration of beta‐blockers or ACE inhibitors need to be monitored, and dosages of diuretics need to be adapted to avoid side effects which affect the quality of life of patients and limit medication adherence etc. The establishment of 'ambulatory' care networks (including multidisciplinary health professionnals of city and hospital and therapeutic patient education) such as that in Isère County in France has demonstrated its effectiveness. However, more advanced tools for patient monitoring still need to be assessed, particularly 'home monitoring', because there is not yet consensus as to the role tele‐monitoring should play in the context of heart failure, and to date recommendations are vague. Assess the clinical and medico‐economic benefit of an innovative patient monitoring strategy 'AUTONOM @ DOM' is needed. The primary aim of this study is then to assess a system of home based telemonitoring .The main outcome is unscheduled hospitalisation for heart failure. secondary aims were to assess the efficacy of this system, quality of life and medico‐economic benefit. This pilot study is realised in the Isère and Essonne counties of France. Patients diagnosed with heart failure will be randomized to one of the following groups: ‐ conventional care including at least a patient education program (ETICS program in Essone county and RESIC38 network in Isere county); ‐ conventional care, plus home telemonitoring including a recording of the heart rate, blood pressure and weight, remotely transmitted to the cardiologist by an approved validated system that includes an alert monitoring feature. The study will last one year starting in April 2014.

AB: We conducted a cost‐utility analysis of a telehealth programme for patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with usual care. A randomized controlled trial was carried out over four months with 45 patients treated with long‐term oxygen therapy, 24 in the telehealth group (TG) and 21 in the control group (CG). The analysis took into account whether the severity of comorbidity (defined as the presence of additional chronic diseases co‐occurring with COPD) was associated with differences in costs and/or quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs). Results of cost‐utility analysis were expressed in terms of the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER). The average total cost was €2300 for the TG and €1103 for the CG, and the average QALY gain was 0.0059 for the TG and 0.0006 for the CG (resulting an ICER of 223,726 €/QALY). For patients without comorbidity, the average total cost was €855 for the TG and €1354 for the CG, and the average QALY gain was 0.0288 for the TG and 0.0082 for the CG (resulting in the telehealth programme being the dominant strategy). For patients with comorbidity, the average total cost was €2782 for the TG and €949 for the CG, and the average QALY gain was ‐0.0017 for the TG and ‐0.0041 for the CG (resulting an ICER of 754,592 €/QALY). The telehealth programme may not have been cost‐effective compared to usual care, although it could be considered cost‐effective for patients without comorbidity.

AB: There is preliminary support for internet‐delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) as a way of improving access to treatment among older adults with anxiety. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to examine the efficacy, long‐term outcomes, and cost‐effectiveness of an iCBT program for adults over 60 years of age with anxiety. Successful applicants were randomly allocated to either the treatment group (n=35) or the waitlist control group (n=37). The online treatment course was delivered over 8 weeks and provided with brief weekly contact with a clinical psychologist via telephone or secure email. Eighty‐four percent of participants completed the iCBT course within the 8 weeks and 90% provided data at posttreatment. Significantly lower scores on measures of anxiety (Cohen's d=1.43; 95% CI: 0.89 ‐ 1.93) and depression (Cohen's d=1.79; 95% CI: 1.21 ‐ 2.32) were found among the treatment group compared to the control group at posttreatment. These lower scores were maintained at 3‐month and 12‐month follow‐up and the treatment group rated the iCBT treatment as acceptable. The treatment group had slightly higher costs ($92.2; 95% CI: $38.7 to $149.2) and Quality‐Adjusted Life‐Years (QALYs=0.010; 95% CI: 0.003 to 0.018) than the control group at posttreatment and the intervention was found to have a greater than 95% probability of being cost‐effective. The results support iCBT as an efficacious and cost‐effective treatment option for older adults with symptoms of anxiety.

AB: Aim Although cardiac rehabilitation improves physical fitness after a cardiac event, many eligible patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation and the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation are often not maintained over time. Home‐based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve participation rates and enhance long‐term effectiveness. Methods and results We randomised 90 low‐to‐moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation to three months of either home‐based training with telemonitoring guidance or centre‐based training. Although training adherence was similar between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home‐based group ( p = 0.02). Physical fitness improved at discharge ( p < 0.01) and at one‐year follow‐up ( p < 0.01) in both groups, without differences between groups (home‐based p = 0.31 and centre‐based p = 0.87). Physical activity levels did not change during the one‐year study period (centre‐based p = 0.38, home‐based p = 0.80). Healthcare costs were statistically non‐significantly lower in the home‐based group (€437 per patient, 95% confidence interval ‐562 to 1436, p = 0.39). From a societal perspective, a statistically non‐significant difference of €3160 per patient in favour of the home‐based group was found (95% confidence interval ‐460 to 6780, p = 0.09) and the probability that it was more cost‐effective varied between 97% and 75% (willingness‐to‐pay of €0 and €100,000 per quality‐adjusted life‐years, respectively). Conclusion We found no differences between home‐based training with telemonitoring guidance and centre‐based training on physical fitness, physical activity level or health‐related quality of life. However, home‐based training was associated with a higher patient satisfaction and appears to be more cost‐effective than centre‐based training. We conclude that home‐based training with telemonitoring guidance can be used as an alternative to centre‐based training for low‐to‐moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation.

AB: OBJECTIVES: First, to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR)‐based telerehabilitation program in the balance recovery of individuals with hemiparesis after stroke in comparison with an in‐clinic program; second, to compare the subjective experiences; and third, to contrast the costs of both programs. DESIGN: Single‐blind, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Neurorehabilitation unit. PARTICIPANTS: Chronic outpatients with stroke (N=30) with residual hemiparesis. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty 45‐minute training sessions with the telerehabilitation system, conducted 3 times a week, in the clinic or in the home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First, Berg Balance Scale for balance assessment. The Performance‐Oriented Mobility Assessment balance and gait subscales, and the Brunel Balance Assessment were secondary outcome measures. Clinical assessments were conducted at baseline, 8 weeks (posttreatment), and 12 weeks (follow‐up). Second, the System Usability Scale and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for subjective experiences. Third, cost (in dollars). RESULTS: Significant improvement in both groups (in‐clinic group [control] and a home‐based telerehabilitation group) from the initial to the final assessment in the Berg Balance Scale (ηp(2)=.68; P=.001), in the balance (ηp(2)=.24; P=.006) and gait (ηp(2)=.57, P=.001) subscales of the Tinetti Performance‐Oriented Mobility Assessment, and in the Brunel Balance Assessment (control: χ(2)=15.0; P=.002; experimental: χ(2)=21.9; P=.001). No significant differences were found between the groups in any balance scale or in the feedback questionnaires. With regard to subjective experiences, both groups considered the VR system similarly usable and motivating. The in‐clinic intervention resulted in more expenses than did the telerehabilitation intervention ($654.72 per person). CONCLUSIONS: First, VR‐based telerehabilitation interventions can promote the reacquisition of locomotor skills associated with balance in the same way as do in‐clinic interventions, both complemented with a conventional therapy program; second, the usability of and motivation to use the 2 interventions can be similar; and third, telerehabilitation interventions can involve savings that vary depending on each scenario.

AB: Background: Telemedicine, the provision of healthcare using an audio‐visual connection, is increasingly used to enhance access to medical care for patients with geographic or mobility limitations. The virtual house call‐conducting a clinical visit remotely with a patient located at home‐has been used successfully in other neurologic disorders but has not been systematically assessed in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Goals: 1) Assess feasibility and satisfaction of virtual house calls for MS patients. 2) Determine differences in cost and visit duration between telemedicine and in‐person visits. Methods: MS patients of a university‐affiliated clinic were recruited to participate in two follow‐up visits with their treating neurologists, at three and six months after the baseline visit. Randomisation determined which type of visit occurred first for each subject (MS clinic versus virtual house call). Subjects completed surveys providing demographics, MS‐related information and opinions on both types of clinical encounter. Feasibility was determined using the percentage of each visit type completed within the scheduled time window. Key questions on subjectcompleted surveys were used to determine subject's satisfaction, time spent, and costs. Results: 42 subjects were randomised, 37 of whom completed both the in‐person and virtual house call visits. Twenty‐five of the 37 (67.6%) telemedicine visits were completed within the specified time frame as compared with 28 of the 38 (73.7%) inperson visits (difference 6.1%, p=0.75). Nearly all subjects (97.1%) reported that they would recommend virtual house call visits to a peer, similar to 97.4% of subjects who would recommend an in‐person visit. A telemedicine visit saved subjects an average of $55 as compared with an in‐person visit. An in‐person visit required an average of 92 minutes longer to complete compared with a telemedicine visit while a significantly greater percentage of the telemedicine visit was spent with the physician (79.0% vs 25.7%, p< 0.01). Subjects' unscripted survey comments expressed satisfaction with the virtual house calls, with frequently mentioned themes of convenience and equivalence with in‐person visits. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that virtual house calls are feasible and well‐liked by a sample of MS patients. The cost effectiveness and time‐savings make this form of telemedicine an attractive method for increasing access to neurologic care for MS patients.

AB: BACKGROUND: Few telemedicine programs have undergone cost analyses, impeding their implementation into practice. We report on the economic analysis of a nurse‐administered intervention designed to improve blood pressure control among hypertensive veterans. METHODS: We randomized hypertensive patients at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center primary care clinic to behavioral (n = 294) or nonbehavioral (n = 294) interventions. Behavioral intervention patients received tailored information bimonthly for 2 years via telephone. To calculate intervention cost, we microcosted the nurse's labor cost and computer hardware and software costs, applied a direct‐to‐indirect cost ratio, and distributed the costs over an estimated cohort of patients. We analyzed data from the Veterans Affairs Decision Support System to assess whether the intervention impacted overall health care utilization and costs. We used life expectancy estimates from the literature to develop decision models to calculate cost per life‐year saved. RESULTS: The mean annual intervention cost was $112 (range $61‐$259). During 2 years of follow‐up, patients in the intervention group incurred $7,800 in inpatient costs and $9,741 in outpatient costs; the nonintervention group incurred $6,866 in inpatient costs and $9,599 in outpatient costs. The total cost difference was not statistically significant (P = .56). Cost‐effectiveness of the behavioral intervention ranged from $42,457 per life‐year saved for normal‐weight women to $87,300 per life‐year saved for normal‐weight men. CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that a nurse‐administered, tailored behavioral intervention can be implemented at nominal cost and be cost‐effective; however, there was no apparent lowering of health care utilization and costs during the 2 years of follow‐up.

DOI: 10.1186/1471-2458-14-807
AB: BACKGROUND: Internet‐ and mobile based stress‐management interventions (iSMI) may be an effective means to address the negative consequences of occupational stress. However, available results from randomised controlled trials are conflicting. Moreover, it is yet not clear whether guided or unguided self‐help iSMI provide better value for money. Internet‐based mental health interventions without guidance are often much less effective than interventions including at least some guidance from a professional. However, direct comparisons in randomised controlled trials are scarce and, to the best of our knowledge, the comparative (cost)‐effectiveness of guided vs. unguided iSMI has not yet been studied. Hence, this study investigates the acceptability and (cost‐) effectiveness of minimal guided and unguided iSMI in employees with heightened levels of perceived stress. METHODS: A three‐armed randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to compare a minimal guided and unguided iSMI with a waiting list control condition (WLC). Both active conditions are based on the same iSMI, i.e. GET.ON Stress, and differ only with regard to the guidance format. Employees with heightened levels of perceived stress (PSS ≥ 22) will be randomised to one of three conditions. Primary outcome will be comparative changes in perceived stress (PSS). Secondary outcomes include changes in self‐reported depression, work‐engagement, presenteeism and absenteeism. Moreover, a cost‐effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a societal perspective, including both direct medical costs and costs related to productivity losses. In addition, a cost‐benefit analysis will be conducted from the employer's perspective. Incremental net‐benefit regression analyses will address the question if there are any baseline factors (i.e. subgroups of employees) associated with particularly favorable cost‐effectiveness when the experimental intervention is offered. Assessments take place at baseline, 7 weeks post‐treatment and 6 months after randomisation. DISCUSSION: Online‐based (guided) self‐help interventions could be an acceptable, effective and economically sustainable approach to offer evidence‐based intervention alternatives to reduce the negative consequences associated with work‐related stress. This study evaluates the (cost‐) effectiveness of two versions of an iSMI, minimal guided and unguided iSMI. Thus, the present study will further enhance the evidence‐base for iSMI and provide valuable information about the optimal balance between outcome and economic costs.

AB: Objectives: To compare the cost‐effectiveness of three types of follow‐up for outpatients with stable low‐activity rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Method: In total, 287 patients were randomized to either planned rheumatologist consultations, shared care without planned consultations, or planned nurse consultations. Effectiveness measures included disease activity (Disease Activity Score based on 28 joint counts and C‐reactive protein, DAS28‐CRP), functional status (Health Assessment Questionnaire, HAQ), and health‐related quality of life (EuroQol EQ‐5D). Cost measures included activities in outpatient clinics and general practice, prescription and non‐prescription medicine, dietary supplements, other health‐care resources, and complementary and alternative care. Measures of effectiveness and costs were collected by self‐reported questionnaires at inclusion and after 12 and 24 months. Incremental cost‐effectiveness rates (ICERs) were estimated in comparison with rheumatologist consultations. Results: Changes in disease activity, functional status, and health‐related quality of life were not statistically significantly different for the three groups, although the mean scores were better for the shared care and nurse care groups compared with the rheumatologist group. Shared care and nurse care were non‐significantly less costly than rheumatologist care. As both shared care and nurse care were associated with slightly better EQ‐5D improvements and lower costs, they dominated rheumatologist care. At EUR 10 000 per quality‐adjusted life year (QALY) threshold, shared care and nurse care were cost‐effective with more than 90% probability. Nurse care was cost‐effective in comparison with shared care with 75% probability. Conclusions: Shared care and nurse care seem to cost less but provide broadly similar health outcomes compared with rheumatologist outpatient care. However, it is still uncertain whether nurse care and shared care are cost‐effective in comparison with rheumatologist outpatient care.

AB: BACKGROUND: Between 50% and 80% of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experience neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) (i.e. constipation and faecal incontinence) that affects quality of life and can lead to hospitalisation. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of abdominal massage plus advice on bowel symptoms on PwMS compared with advice only. A process evaluation investigated the factors that affected the clinical effectiveness and possible implementation of the different treatments. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial with process evaluation and health economic components. Outcome analysis was undertaken blind. SETTING: The trial took place in 12 UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: PwMS who had 'bothersome' NBD. INTERVENTION: Following individualised training, abdominal massage was undertaken daily for 6 weeks (intervention group). Advice on good bowel management as per the Multiple Sclerosis Society advice booklet was provided to both groups. All participants received weekly telephone calls from the research nurse. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the difference between the intervention and control groups in change in the NBD score from baseline to week 24. Secondary outcomes were measured via a bowel diary, adherence diary, the Constipation Scoring System, patient resource questionnaire and the EuroQol‐5 Dimensions, five‐level version (EQ‐5D‐5L). RESULTS: A total of 191 participants were finalised, 189 of whom were randomised (two participants were finalised in error) (control group, n = 99; intervention group, n = 90) and an intention‐to‐treat analysis was performed. The mean age was 52 years (standard deviation 10.83 years), 81% (n = 154) were female and 11% (n = 21) were wheelchair dependent. Fifteen participants from the intervention group and five from the control group were lost to follow‐up. The change in NBD score by week 24 demonstrated no significant difference between groups [mean difference total score ‐1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.32 to 0.04; p = 0.0558]; there was a significant difference between groups in the change in the frequency of stool evacuation per week (mean difference 0.62, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.21; p = 0.039) and in the number of times per week that participants felt that they emptied their bowels completely (mean difference 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.76; p = 0.002), in favour of the intervention group. Of participant interviewees, 75% reported benefits, for example less difficulty passing stool, more complete evacuations, less bloated, improved appetite, and 85% continued with the massage. A cost‐utility analysis conducted from a NHS and patient cost perspective found in the imputed sample with bootstrapping a mean incremental outcome effect of the intervention relative to usual care of ‐0.002 quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs) (95% CI ‐0.029 to 0.027 QALYs). In the same imputed sample with bootstrapping, the mean incremental cost effect of the intervention relative to usual care was £56.50 (95% CI ‐£372.62 to £415.68). No adverse events were reported. Limitations include unequal randomisation, dropout and the possibility of ineffective massage technique. CONCLUSION: The increment in the primary outcome favoured the intervention group, but it was small and not statistically significant. The economic analysis identified that the intervention was dominated by the control group. Given the small improvement in the primary outcome, but not in terms of QALYs, a low‐cost version of the intervention might be considered worthwhile by some patients. FUTURE WORK: Research is required to establish possible mechanisms of action and modes of massage delivery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN85007023 and NCT03166007.

AB: Introduction In many settings, control of sexually transmissible infections (STIs) is compromised by lack of laboratory infrastructure, physical distance from laboratories and loss to follow up of patients. Point‐of‐care (POC) tests have the potential to provide timely diagnosis, treatment and partner notification, and in turn reduce infection rates. In April 2013, we will implement the first cluster randomised trial of chlamydia and gonorrhoea POC testing in remote Aboriginal communities where STIs are endemic. Methods: The study, called TTANGO (test, treat and go), will measure the effectiveness, cost‐effectiveness and cultural and operational acceptability of POC testing for chlamydia and gonorrhoea infections. The study design is a crossover, cluster, randomised controlled trial involving 12 health services in remote Aboriginal communities in Australia. The primary outcome is the percentage of people with persistent chlamydia and gonorrhoea positive tests. The trial runs for 2 years and is a partnership between research, government and community organisations. Results: TTANGO is reaching the conclusion of the preparation phase and has achieved significant steps, including the engagement of remote health services and communities, a comprehensive laboratory and field evaluation to select the ideal assay, development of the first formal training package for chlamydia and gonorrhoea POC testing, and a quality assurance programme. The GeneXpert® CT/NG molecular POC assay was selected for the trial as it showed very high sensitivity and specificity compared to other assays, was easy to use and results were available in approximately 90 minutes. This paper will discuss progress in preparing and implementing TTANGO, the methodology and evaluation. Conclusion: The results of this RCT will provide crucial information to guide sexual health clinical practise in remote Aboriginal communities and other settings internationally. Mathematical modelling and health economic analyses will be used to make the case for large scale implementation of this technology.

AB: OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the burden borne by and the costs to informal caregivers of patients with remotely monitored (RM) pacemakers. METHODS: The PONIENTE study was a controlled, non‐randomised clinical trial, with data collected from informal caregivers, 12 months after implantation of pacemakers. The survey on disabilities, personal autonomy, and dependency situations was used to gather information on demographic and social characteristics, levels of professionalism, time and types of care, difficulties in providing care, health status, professional aspects, economic and family or leisure impacts due to informal caregiving for patients with pacemakers. RESULTS: During 14 months, 76 caregivers were enrolled in the PONIENTE trial. Of which, 26 were included in the RM group and 50 in the hospital‐monitored group (HM). The mean ages were 58.62 ± 16.51 and 61.10 ± 12.67 years, respectively (p = 0.56) in the groups, and 69.7 % were females. The majority (96.1 %) of the caregivers declared that they had to provide their services between 6 and 7 days per week (88.5 % in RM group versus 100 % in HM group; p = 0.037). The costs related to care provided by the informal caregivers were 21.38 % lower in the RM group than in the HM group (p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: The PONIENTE study shows a significant impact of informal care on relatives and friends of patients with pacemakers in terms of their well‐being and costs.

Results: During 14 months, 76 caregivers were enrolled in the PONIENTE trial. Of which, 26 were included in the RM group and 50 in the hospital‐monitored group (HM). The mean ages were 58.62 +/‐ 16.51 and 61.10 +/‐ 12.67 years, respectively (p = 0.56) in the groups, and 69.7 % were females. The majority (96.1 %) of the caregivers declared that they had to provide their services between 6 and 7 days per week (88.5 % in RM group versus 100 % in HM group; p = 0.037). The costs related to care provided by the informal caregivers were 21.38 % lower in the RM group than in the HM group (p = 0.033). Conclusions: The PONIENTE study shows a significant impact of informal care on relatives and friends of patients with pacemakers in terms of their well‐being and costs. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02234245.

AB: Purpose: Remote home monitoring (HM) systems allow the control of device status, lead function and cardiac rhythm without outpatient visits. In the SAVE‐Trial we evaluated the safety, reliability and cost effectiveness of heart failure patient management using the BIOTRONIK Home Monitoringw‐system in ICD‐patients over a follow‐up (FU) of 2 years. Methods: 36 ICD‐patients were recruited 3 months after implantation. 18 patients were randomised to HM‐ON, receiving remote monitoring plus one outpatient clinic visit per year; 18 patients were randomised to HM‐OFF and followed a standard outpatient clinic control scheme every 6 months. Results: In the HM‐ON group outpatient clinic FUs were reduced significantly vs. HM‐OFF group (0.98 vs 1.75 FU/year; p < 0.05). 46 outpatient clinic controls were performed in the HM‐ON group. 31 of those were scheduled 1 year FUs according to the study design (67.4%), 15 FUs were unscheduled (32.6%) due to event reports (82%) or clinical interventions (18%). 93% of the unscheduled visits were clinically relevant, but only 45% of the scheduled routine FUs. Cost analysis showed a significant reduction in ICD control costs in the HM‐ON group. Conclusion: The Home Monitoring‐system is a safe and cost‐effective alternative to regular outpatient clinic FUs which allows better detection of dysfunctions and disease‐related events in which an intervention is indicated.

DOI: 10.1186/s12913-016-1717-7
AB: BACKGROUND: Decentralised services using outreach clinics or modern technology are methods to reduce both patient transports and costs to the healthcare system. Telemedicine consultations via videoconference are one such modality. Before new technologies are implemented, it is important to investigate both the quality of care given and the economic impact from the use of this new technology. The aim of this clinical trial was to study the quality of planned remote orthopaedic consultations by help of videoconference. METHOD: We performed a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel groups: video‐assisted remote consultations at a regional medical centre (RMC) as an intervention versus standard consultation in the orthopaedic outpatient clinic at the University Hospital of North Norway (UNN) as a control. The participants were patients referred to or scheduled for a consultation at the orthopaedic outpatient clinic. The orthopaedic surgeons evaluated each consultation they performed by completing a questionnaire. The primary outcome measurement was the difference in the sum score calculated from this questionnaire, which was evaluated by the non‐inferiority of the intervention group. The study design was based on the intention to treat principle. Ancillary analyses regarding complications, the number of consultations per patient, operations, patients who were referred again and the duration of consultations were performed. RESULTS: Four‐hundred patients were web‐based randomised. Of these, 199 (98 %) underwent remote consultation and 190 (95 %) underwent standard consultation. The primary outcome, the sum score of the specialist evaluation, was significantly lower (i.e. 'better') at UNN compared to RMC (1.72 versus 1.82, p = 0.0030). The 90 % confidence interval (CI) for the difference in score (0.05, 0.17) was within the non‐inferiority margin. The orthopaedic surgeons involved evaluated 98 % of the video‐assisted consultations as 'good' or 'very good'. In the ancillary analyses, there was no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the argument that it is safe to offer video‐assisted consultations for selected orthopaedic patients. We did not find any serious events related to the mode of consultation. Further assessments of the economic aspects and patient satisfaction are needed before we can recommend its wider application.

AB: Background: The use of mesh in prolapse surgery is controversial, leading to a number of enquiries into its safety and efficacy. Objective: To compare synthetic non‐absorbable mesh inlay, biological graft and mesh kit with a standard repair in terms of clinical effectiveness, adverse effects, quality of life (QoL), costs and cost‐effectiveness. Design: Two randomised controlled trials within a comprehensive cohort (CC) study. Allocation was by a remote web‐based randomisation system in a 1 :1 : 1 ratio (Primary trial) or 1 : 1 : 2 ratio (Secondary trial), nd was minimised on age, type of prolapse repair planned, need for a concomitant continence procedure, need for a concomitant upper vaginal prolapse procedure and surgeon. Participants and outcome assessors were blinded to randomisation; participants were unblinded if they requested the information. Surgeons were not blinded to allocated procedure. Setting: Thirty‐five UK hospitals. Participants: Primary study: 2474 women in the analysis (including 1348 randomised) having primary anterior or posterior prolapse surgery. Secondary study: 398 in the analysis (including 154 randomised)having repeat anterior or posterior prolapse surgery. CC3: 215 women having either uterine or vault prolapse repair. Interventions: Anterior or posterior repair alone, or with mesh inlay, biological graft or mesh kit. Main outcome measures: Prolapse symptoms [Pelvic Organ Prolapse Symptom Score (POP‐SS)]; prolapse‐specific QoL; cost‐effectiveness [incremental cost per quality‐adjusted life‐year (QALY)]. Results: Primary trials: adjusting for baseline and minimisation covariates, mean POP‐SS was similar for each comparison {standard 5.4 [standard deviation (SD) 5.5] vs. mesh 5.5 (SD 5.1), mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.70 to 0.71; standard 5.5 (SD 5.6) vs. graft 5.6 (SD 5.6), MD ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐0.93 to 0.63}. Serious non‐mesh adverse effects rates were similar between the groups in year 1 [standard 7.2% vs. mesh 7.8%, risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.72; standard 6.3% vs. graft 9.8%, RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.59]. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in any other outcome measure. The cumulative mesh complication rates over 2 years were 2 of 430 (0.5%) for standard repair (trial 1), 46 of 435 (10.6%) for mesh inlay and 2 of 368 (0.5%) for biological graft. The CC findings were comparable. Incremental costs were 363 (95% CI‐32 to 758) and 565 (95% CI 180 to 950) for mesh and graft vs. standard, respectively. Incremental QALYs were 0.071 (95% CI ‐0.004 to 0.145) and 0.039 (95% CI ‐0.041 to 0.120) for mesh and graft vs. standard, respectively. A Markov decision model extrapolating trial results over 5 years showed standard repair had the highest probability of cost‐effectiveness, but results were surrounded by considerable uncertainty. Secondary trials: there were no statistically significant differences between the randomised groups in any outcome measure, but the sample size was too small to be conclusive. The cumulative mesh complication rates over 2 years were 7 of 52 (13.5%) for mesh inlay and 4 of 46 (8.7%) for mesh kit, with no mesh exposures for standard repair. Conclusions: In women who were having primary repairs, there was evidence of no benefit from the use of mesh inlay or biological graft compared with standard repair in terms of efficacy, QoL or adverse effects(other than mesh complications) in the short term. The Secondary trials were too small to provide conclusive results. Copyright © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost‐effectiveness of optometrist‐led follow‐up monitoring reviews for patients with quiescent neovascular age‐related macular degeneration (nAMD) in community settings (including high street opticians) compared with ophthalmologist‐led reviews in hospitals. DESIGN: A model‐based cost‐effectiveness analysis with a 4‐week time horizon, based on a 'virtual' non‐inferiority randomised trial designed to emulate a parallel group design. SETTING: A virtual internet‐based clinical assessment, conducted at community optometry practices, and hospital ophthalmology clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Ophthalmologists with experience in the age‐related macular degeneration service; fully qualified optometrists not participating in nAMD shared care schemes. INTERVENTIONS: The participating optometrists and ophthalmologists classified lesions from vignettes and were asked to judge whether any retreatment was required. Vignettes comprised clinical information, colour fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography images. Participants' classifications were validated against experts' classifications (reference standard). Resource use and cost information were attributed to these retreatment decisions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Correct classification of whether further treatment is needed, compared with a reference standard. RESULTS: The mean cost per assessment, including the subsequent care pathway, was £411 for optometrists and £397 for ophthalmologists: a cost difference of £13 (95% CI ‐£18 to £45). Optometrists were non‐inferior to ophthalmologists with respect to the overall percentage of lesions correctly assessed (difference ‐1.0%; 95% CI ‐4.5% to 2.5%). CONCLUSIONS: In the base case analysis, the slightly larger number of incorrect retreatment decisions by optometrists led to marginally and non‐significantly higher costs. Sensitivity analyses that reflected different practices across eye hospitals indicate that shared care pathways between optometrists and ophthalmologists can be identified which may reduce demands on scant hospital resources, although in light of the uncertainty around differences in outcome and cost it remains unclear whether the differences between the 2 care pathways are significant in economic terms.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Home mechanical ventilation (HMV) in the Netherlands is normally initiated in hospital, but this is expensive and often a burden for the patient. In this randomised controlled study we investigated whether initiation of HMV at home in patients with chronic respiratory failure is non‐inferior to an in hospital based setting. METHODS: Seventy‐seven patients were included, of which 38 patients started HMV at home. All patients were diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure due to a neuromuscular or thoracic cage disease. Primary outcome was the arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) while quality of life and costs were secondary outcomes. Telemonitoring was used in the home group to provide therapeutic information, for example; transcutaneous carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation and ventilator information, to the caregivers. Follow‐up was six months. RESULTS: PaCO2, improved by 0.72 (SE ± 0.16) kPa in the hospital group and by 0.91 (±0.20) in the home group, both improvements being significant and the latter clearly not inferior. There were also significant improvements in quality of life in both groups, again not being inferior with home treatment. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that initiation of HMV at home in a selective group of patients with chronic respiratory failure is as effective for gas exchange and quality of life as hospital initiation. In addition we found that it is safe, technically feasible and that more than € 3000 per patient can be saved compared to our standard care.

AB: BACKGROUND: Telemedicine in an ambulatory surgical population remains incompletely evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To investigate patient encounters in the outpatient setting using video visit (VV) technology compared to traditional office visits (OVs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: From June 2013 to March 2014, 55 prescreened men with a history of prostate cancer were prospectively randomized. VVs, with the patient at home or at work, were included in the outpatient clinic calendar of urologists. INTERVENTION: Remote VV versus traditional OV. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: An equivalence analysis was used to assess the primary outcome, visit efficiency as measured by time studies. Secondary outcomes were patient/provider satisfaction and costs. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: There were 28 VVs and 27 OVs. VVs were equivalent in efficiency to relative to OVs, as measured by patient‐provider face time (mean 14.5 vs 14.3min; p=0.96), patient wait time (18.4 vs 13.0min; p=0.20), and total time devoted to care (17.9 vs 17.8min; p=0.97). There were no significant differences in patient perception of visit confidentiality, efficiency, education quality, or overall satisfaction. VVs incurred lower costs, including distance traveled (median 0 vs 95 miles), travel time (0 vs 95min), missed work (0 vs 1 d), and money spent on travel ($0 vs $48; all p<0.0001). There was a high level of urologist satisfaction for both VVs (88%) and OVs (90%). The major limitation was sample size. CONCLUSIONS: VV in the ambulatory postprostatectomy setting may have a future role in health care delivery models. We found equivalent efficiency, similar satisfaction, but significantly reduced patient costs for VV compared to OV. Further prospective analyses are warranted. PATIENT SUMMARY: Among men with surgically treated prostate cancer, we evaluated the utility of remote video visits compared to office visits for outpatient consultation with a urologist. Video visits were associated with equivalent efficiency, similar satisfaction, and significantly lower patient costs when compared to office visits. We conclude that video visits may have a future role in health care delivery models.

RESULTS: Primary trials: adjusting for baseline and minimisation covariates, mean POP‐SS was similar for each comparison {standard 5.4 [standard deviation (SD) 5.5] vs. mesh 5.5 (SD 5.1), mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.70 to 0.71; standard 5.5 (SD 5.6) vs. graft 5.6 (SD 5.6), MD ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐0.93 to 0.63}. Serious non‐mesh adverse effects rates were similar between the groups in year 1 [standard 7.2% vs. mesh 7.8%, risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.72; standard 6.3% vs. graft 9.8%, RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.59]. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in any other outcome measure. The cumulative mesh complication rates over 2 years were 2 of 430 (0.5%) for standard repair (trial 1), 46 of 435 (10.6%) for mesh inlay and 2 of 368 (0.5%) for biological graft. The CC findings were comparable. Incremental costs were £363 (95% CI ‐£32 to £758) and £565 (95% CI £180 to £950) for mesh and graft vs. standard, respectively. Incremental QALYs were 0.071 (95% CI ‐0.004 to 0.145) and 0.039 (95% CI ‐0.041 to 0.120) for mesh and graft vs. standard, respectively. A Markov decision model extrapolating trial results over 5 years showed standard repair had the highest probability of cost‐effectiveness, but results were surrounded by considerable uncertainty. Secondary trials: there were no statistically significant differences between the randomised groups in any outcome measure, but the sample size was too small to be conclusive. The cumulative mesh complication rates over 2 years were 7 of 52 (13.5%) for mesh inlay and 4 of 46 (8.7%) for mesh kit, with no mesh exposures for standard repair. CONCLUSIONS: In women who were having primary repairs, there was evidence of no benefit from the use of mesh inlay or biological graft compared with standard repair in terms of efficacy, QoL or adverse effects (other than mesh complications) in the short term. The Secondary trials were too small to provide conclusive results. LIMITATIONS: Women in the Primary trials included some with a previous repair in another compartment. Follow‐up is vital to identify any long‐term potential benefits and serious adverse effects. FUTURE WORK: Long‐term follow‐up to at least 6 years after surgery is ongoing to identify recurrence rates, need for further prolapse surgery, adverse effects and cost‐effectiveness.

AB: Drs. Biggs, Whiteside and Vickers will plan and oversee the randomized controlled mixed methods study of the phase II prototype version of the Virtual Reality (VR) exposure therapy system. Participants will complete a baseline study session with study staff at the Mayo Clinic, all of whom have experience with exposure therapy. Participants will then be assigned two weeks of daily exposure homework with or without VR, depending on condition, using Anxiety Coach to record each exposure and SUDS. Patients randomized to intervention will take home the VR system for homework completion, and participants assigned to control will not take the VR system home and will be instructed to complete imaginal exposures. Participants will be asked to record each exposure, even if it is not related to the fear addressed with the baseline exposures, in order to capture all exposures completed during the homework period. Use of Anxiety Coach will allow for automatic recording of the exposure's time and date of completion, content, maximum and final SUDS, and duration. Two weeks after the baseline session, all participants will return for a follow up session in which they complete both types of exposure (order randomized) as well as a third generalization exposure, i.e., an exposure related to the baseline exposure that is higher on the fear ladder for the targeted fear.

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct01609842
YR: 2012
KY: Acute Coronary Syndrome; Cardiovascular Diseases; Clopidogrel
AB: I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims The main objective is to conduct a type 1 hybrid effectiveness/implementation study to test the effectiveness of a successfully‐piloted, evidence‐based, multi‐faceted intervention to improve patient adherence to clopidogrel following PCI. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that a successfully‐piloted, evidence‐based, multi‐faceted intervention targeting Veterans following PCI procedure improves adherence to clopidogrel, reduces bleeding, myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality among these patients, and is cost‐effective. The proposed intervention will be based on the Chronic Care Model and will build on the investigators' pilot work as well as will leverage the VA's CART‐CL, a uniform cath lab procedure reporting tool at all VA cath labs. The study will be evaluated using the REAIM framework consisting of the following components, reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance. The intervention will adapt elements of prior successful intervention, including patient education, collaboration between cath lab clinicians and impatient/outpatient pharmacy teams, and telemonitoring via interactive voice response (IVR) technology. This type I hybrid effectiveness/implementation study will be tested at 16 sites randomized to intervention with an average of 90 patients per site per 6 month period versus usual care. Specific Aims: 1. To evaluate current practices at VA PCI facilities (n=20) to enhance adherence to clopidogrel, both at hospital discharge and during longitudinal follow‐up. 2. To implement the multi‐faceted intervention at 16 total sites through 4 roll‐out phases (4 sites during each roll‐out) in a randomized stepped wedge trial design. 3. To assess barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation during each roll‐out phase through semi‐structured interviews and incorporate lessons learned from each roll‐out phase into subsequent roll‐out phases. 4. To determine the effectiveness of a successfully‐piloted, evidence‐based, multi‐faceted intervention versus usual care for improving clopidogrel filling at hospital discharge and adherence to clopidogrel (primary outcomes). 5. To determine the effectiveness of a successfully‐piloted, evidence‐based, multi‐faceted intervention versus usual care for reducing the combined cardiovascular endpoints of bleeding, myocardial infarction, stroke, and mortality (secondary outcomes). 6. To assess the incremental cost‐effectiveness of the successfully‐piloted, evidence‐based, multi‐faceted intervention compared with usual care. II. Background and Significance: The investigators have successfully piloted the intervention to improve clopidogrel adherence following PCI. The investigators developed a software application integrated within CART‐CL that assessed whether patients fill their clopidogrel prescription at hospital discharge. If clopidogrel was not filled, patients were contacted to identify barriers to medication filling. During follow‐up, automated telephone calls were sent to patients to educate them about the importance of medication adherence and to remind them to refill clopidogrel prior to the refill due date. The software application successfully identified all 15 patients enrolled in the pilot who underwent PCI and whether they filled clopidogrel at hospital discharge at 2 VAMCs. In qualitative interviews about the automated calls, all patients indicated that the refill reminder messages were helpful. A majority of participants indicated that they felt the education/support from the messages or participation in the study was helpful or would be helpful to others. A few patients shared that the messages also supported refilling other medications and reminding them to ask clarifying questions about other medications. Following the successful pilot, the investigators' next step is to test the effectiveness of the intervention and study the implementation process across a range of VA facilities. Building on the prior work and evidence from the literature, the investigators have developed the intervention informed by the Chronic Care Model (CCM) which is a framework that uses clinical information systems to facilitate evidence‐based quality improvement. The investigators will leverage CART‐CL, IVR technology, patient self‐management, and team‐based care to foster efficient, productive interactions between activated patients and proactive clinical teams to improve clopidogrel adherence. Further the components of the intervention directly address many of the reasons that patients have highlighted as leading to early clopidogrel discontinuation. This study will refine the current state of knowledge on improving medication adherence in multiple ways. First, it combines multiple interventions that have been separately shown to be effective in improving medication adherence and addresses causes of clopidogrel non‐adherence identified by patients. Second, the intervention focuses on a novel setting (i.e., patients discharged following PCI and transitioning to outpatient care) in contrast to prior adherence interventions that have focused only on patients with stable chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension). Prior work by the investigators' group and others suggest that the immediate post‐ACS period, and more generally transitions from the inpatient to the outpatient setting, are particularly 'vulnerable periods' for medication adherence. Yet prior interventions have not specifically targeted this setting. Third, the targeted medication in this study has demonstrated short‐term benefits and where non‐adherence can have immediate adverse outcomes (e.g., stent thrombosis). Prior studies have focused on medications (e.g., hypertension medications) where non‐adherence leads to problems longer term rather than the short term. Fourth, the study utilizes existing resources (i.e., cardiac data systems integrated with the VA electronic health record, VA pharmacists and patient‐aligned care teams) to implement the intervention, improving the feasibility of broader implementation. Prior adherence interventions have generally required significant additional resources and the majority of quality improvement interventions are not continued following the end of the research project. This proposal will extend the current state of knowledge on medication adherence by demonstrating that a successful intervention will need multiple evidence‐based components, and designed with plans for implementation in mind. Finally, this study is being conducted as a type I hybrid implementation study and therefore includes extensive study of the implementation process, which will yield both contributions to implementation science and facilitate wider dissemination if the intervention is found to be effective. Furthermore, the study will make two important contributions to implementation science. First, the investigators will integrate a structured survey, the organizational readiness to change assessment (ORCA), for use in the formative and summative evaluations (described further in the evaluation plan). The ORCA has previously been psychometrically validated and found to predict implementation effectiveness. However, it has not been previously tested as a tool to support implementation. Findings from this study will help us understand if and how the ORCA can be used to support other implementation projects, and will contribute to users' materials for the survey. Second, the investigators are using an innovative study design, a randomized stepped wedge design, and building‐in iterative formative evaluation to guide implementation of the intervention at sites in subsequent cohorts. As far as the investigators know, this kind of iterative rollout design with planned formative evaluation has not been used in an effectiveness/implementation hybrid study. If it works as planned, and provides useful formative evaluation findings from early cohorts, it may represent an important adaptation of the hybrid design. In terms of VA patient care, if the intervention is successful, it will increase adherence to clopidogrel by helping patients take their anti‐platelet medication routinely as prescribed, the quality of cardiovascular care for Veterans since adherence to clopidogrel has been associated with reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality following PCI, and the efficiency of care by using telephone calls and telemonitoring for communication with patients rather than clinic visits. This study will leverage the automated pharmacy system and tele‐monitoring technology for which the VA is a nationally recognized leader. Further, the study will address an important gap in knowledge (i.e., how to improve adherence to clopidogrel medications following PCI) and the findings can inform future interventions to improve adherence to other chronic cardiovascular medications. Finally, since the study is designed to be implemented using existing personnel/staff and current national platforms (i.e., CART‐CL and PACT teamlets), it will be generalizable to other VA Medical Centers and Veterans.

AB: The prevalence of chronic obstructive airway diseases(COAD), including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma lead to huge economic and social burden. Effective management of stable COAD is essential to improve quality of life and reduce medical expenditure. In order to improve the management of COAD, we have developed a mobile phone‐based e‐health app with five steps which are follows: (i)ask: QR code scan to add patients, collect consent, questionnaire and personal information;(ii)assess: evaluate or analysis examination, including lung function test and X‐ray;(iii) advice: based on assessment, provide diagnosis, differential diagnosis and further examination suggestion; (iv)arrangement: management of patients by the characteristics, provide patient education, treatment and rehabilitation; and (v)assist: based on e‐health, to improve the link between experts and GPs, anywhere, anytime, which could improve the efficacy of e‐health. In a recent study, at least 600 patients with stable GOLD group C or D COPD and with a history of at least two moderate‐to‐severe exacerbations within the previous year will be randomly allocated to the control group, which receives routine follow‐up, or the intervention group, which receives e‐health management. Endpoints of the study include (i) frequency and severity of acute exacerbation; (ii) symptomatic evaluation; (iii) pre‐bronchodilator and post‐bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) measurement; (iv) exercise capacity; and (v) direct medical cost per year. Results from this study should provide direct evidence for the suitability of e‐health in stable COPD patient management. There will be another study for asthma in next year. In conclusion, e‐health could be a useful technology for managing patients with COAD by experts and GPs. For its scientific effect, we need further investigation.

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02425267
YR: 2015
KY: Fractures, Bone; Humeral Fractures; Shoulder Fractures
AB: Every year, one out of three elderly people make at least one fall, and 10% of them cause a fracture. Of these fractures, those of the proximal humerus, the forearm and the wrist count for approximately one third of total osteoporotic fractures in elderly people. Proximal humerus fractures can be treated surgically (eg: pinning, plate and screws, etc..) or conventionally by wearing a splint or a cast. Whether either of these approaches, the individual requires rehabilitation to prevent function limitations. Among the possible reasons for the low use of rehabilitation services, there are 1) poor availability of rehabilitation services for fractures of the humerus; or 2) the difficulty of the elderly to travel to receive these services because of their precarious status. Telerehabilitation is a promising alternative approach that can help improve access to rehabilitation services once patients are discharged from hospital. Some studies demonstrate that physiotherapy is a significant factor in the process of healing and functional recovery of a proximal humerus fracture, and that, for conservative or surgical treatment. This is showed by the good recovery of patients and by their satisfaction with the physiotherapy. In addition, since the majority of patients with a proximal humerus fracture are elderly, it becomes relevant to find a new way to offer quick service physiotherapy and simple and suitable to their condition. The main objective of the study is to compare the clinical effects of the innovative telerehabilitation approach (TELE group) compared to face‐to‐face visits to a clinic (CLINIC group) for patients treated for a proximal humerus fracture. The research hypothesis are: 1. TELE intervention will be as effective as CLINIC intervention to improve upper extremity function. 2. TELE intervention will be as effective as CLINIC intervention to improve deficiencies of the shoulder (increase range of motion). 3. Participants who received the TELE intervention will be as satisfied of their care as participants who received the CLINICL intervention. 4. TELE intervention will be less costly compared to the CLINIC intervention. Methodology: The study has a randomized control trial design. The study population of interest is individuals who have had proximal humerus fracture and who receive a conservative treatment at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS) and who are returning at home. Participants will be recruited during their visit at the emergency or outpatient clinic by the medical team or research nurse assistant. The investigators expect to recruit 52 participants, that is to say 26 per group. All evaluations will be completed in the research center/hospital and will be approximately 1.5 hour in duration. The first evaluation will be conducted when medical team will ask for rehabilitation (T1) to allow participant base measures to be collected. The other evaluation will be conducted immediately after the 2‐month intervention (T2). The independent variable is conventional physiotherapy and experimental intervention by telerehabilitation. The dependant variables are 1) upper extremity function; 2) range of motion; 3) user satisfaction; 4) cost of services according to the healthcare system. Platform used: In this study, a platform based on a technological infrastructure that was developed and tested in previous telerehabilitation studies will be used. The infrastructure combines a clinical information system with videoconference components (Tandberg 550 MXP, H 264) and uses cameras that are controlled by the clinician using computer software. The difference between the two groups will then be compared using a t‐test or a chi‐square test. The economic analysis will be a type of cost‐effectiveness. The cost per unit of change in the main dependent variable (Constant Score) will be determined for the two groups (TELE and CONTROL) and the cost differential will be established.

AB: PURPOSE: Cost analysis and patient satisfaction with telemedicine in epilepsy care. METHODS: This controlled study included out‐of‐town epilepsy patients coming to follow‐up at the University of Alberta hospital epilepsy clinic. After an informed consent, patients were randomized to either conventional (n = 18) or telemedicine (n = 23) clinics. Patients or caregivers filled patient satisfaction and travel cost questionnaires in both alternatives. Cost per visit analysis included costs of traveling, lodging, and lost productivity. RESULTS: Average age of the population was 41 years (range 19‐73; 45% women). Eighty‐three percent of patients preferred their next visit through telemedicine. About 90% of patients indicated a need for companion travel (mainly by car) to conventional clinic. For the conventional group patients the value of lost productivity was CAD $201, hotel cost CAD $8.50, and the value of car mileage CAD $256.50, totaling about CAD $466.00. Patient costs for telemedicine were CAD $35.85. Telemedicine production costs are similar to the patients' savings in traveling and lost productivity. About 90% of patients in both groups were satisfied with the quality of the service. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can play a role in follow‐up care of epilepsy patients, reduce patient costs, and improve patient satisfaction. This is the first full‐time epilepsy telemedicine clinic in Western Canada.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impacts on Medicare costs of providing a particular type of home telemedicine to eligible Medicare beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Two cohorts of beneficiaries (n = 1,665 and 504, respectively) living in two medically underserved areas of New York between 2000 and 2007 were randomized to intensive nurse case management via televisits or usual care. Medicare service use and costs covering a 6‐year follow‐up period were drawn from claims data. Impacts were estimated using regression analyses. RESULTS: Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel) did not reduce Medicare costs in either site. Total costs were between 71 and 116% higher for the treatment group than for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Although IDEATel had modest effects on clinical outcomes (reported elsewhere), it did not reduce Medicare use or costs for health services. The intervention's costs were excessive (over $8,000 per person per year) compared with programs with similar‐sized clinical impacts

AB: Background: Primary care models that offer comprehensive, accessible care to all patients may provide insufficient resources to meet the needs of patients with complex conditions who have the greatest risk for hospitalization. Objective: To assess whether augmenting usual primary care with team‐based intensive management lowers utilization and costs for high‐risk patients. Design: Randomized quality improvement trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03100526) Setting: 5 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. Patients: Primary care patients at high risk for hospitalization who had a recent acute care episode. Intervention: Locally tailored intensive management programs providing care coordination, goals assessment, health coaching, medication reconciliation, and home visits through an interdisciplinary team, including a physician or nurse practitioner, a nurse, and psychosocial experts. Measurements: Utilization and costs (including intensive management program expenses) 12 months before and after randomization. Results: 2210 patients were randomly assigned, 1105 to intensive management and 1105 to usual care. Patients had a mean age of 63 years and an average of 7 chronic conditions; 90% were men. Of the patients assigned to intensive management, 487 (44%) received intensive outpatient care (that is, ≥3 encounters in person or by telephone) and 204 (18%) received limited intervention. From the pre‐ to postrandomization periods, mean inpatient costs decreased more for the intensive management than the usual care group ($2164 [95% CI, $7916 to $3587]). Outpatient costs increased more for the intensive management than the usual care group ($2636 [CI, $524 to $4748]), driven by greater use of primary care, home care, telephone care, and telehealth. Mean total costs were similar in the 2 groups before and after randomization. Limitations: Sites took up to several months to contact eligible patients, limiting the time between treatment and outcome assessment. Only VA costs were assessed. Conclusion: High‐risk patients with access to an intensive management program received more outpatient care with no increase in total costs.

AB: BACKGROUND: Diarrhoea is a leading cause of child death in Zambia. As elsewhere, the disease burden could be greatly reduced through caregiver uptake of existing prevention and treatment strategies. We recently reported the results of the Komboni Housewives intervention which tested a novel strategy employing motives including affiliation and disgust to improve caregiver practice of four diarrhoea control behaviours: exclusive breastfeeding; handwashing with soap; and correct preparation and use of oral rehydration salts (ORS) and zinc. The intervention was delivered via community events (women's forums and road shows), at health clinics (group session) and via radio. A cluster randomised trial revealed that the intervention resulted in a small improvement in exclusive breastfeeding practices, but was only associated with small changes in the other behaviours in areas with greater intervention exposure. This paper reports the findings of the process evaluation that was conducted alongside the trial to investigate how factors associated with intervention delivery and receipt influenced caregiver uptake of the target behaviours. METHODS: Process data were collected from the eight peri‐urban and rural intervention areas throughout the six‐month implementation period and in all 16 clusters 4‐6 weeks afterwards. Intervention implementation (fidelity, reach, dose delivered and recruitment strategies) and receipt (participant engagement and responses, and mediators) were explored through review of intervention activity logs, unannounced observation of intervention events, semi‐structured interviews, focus groups with implementers and intervention recipients, and household surveys. Evaluation methods and analyses were guided by the intervention's theory of change and the evaluation framework of Linnan and Steckler. RESULTS: Intervention reach was lower than intended: 39% of the surveyed population reported attending one or more face‐to‐face intervention event, of whom only 11% attended two or more intervention events. The intervention was not equally feasible to deliver in all settings: fewer events took place in remote rural areas, and the intervention did not adequately penetrate communities in several peri‐urban sites where the population density was high, the population was slightly higher socio‐economic status, recruitment was challenging, and numerous alternative sources of entertainment existed. Adaptations made by the implementers affected the fidelity of implementation of messages for all target behaviours. Incorrect messages were consequently recalled by intervention recipients. Participants were most receptive to the novel disgust and skills‐based interactive demonstrations targeting exclusive breastfeeding and ORS preparation respectively. However, initial disgust elicitation was not followed by a change in associated psychological mediators, and social norms were not measurably changed. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of measured behaviour change was likely due to issues with both the intervention's content and its delivery. Achieving high reach and intensity in community interventions delivered in diverse settings is challenging. Achieving high fidelity is also challenging when multiple behaviours are targeted for change. Further work using improved tools is needed to explore the use of subconscious motives in behaviour change interventions. To better uncover how and why interventions achieve their measured effects, process evaluations of complex interventions should develop and employ frameworks for investigation and interpretation that are structured around the intervention's theory of change and the local context. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered as part of the larger trial on 5 March 2014 with ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02081521 .

AB: INTRODUCTION: Few data are available on actual follow‐up costs of remote monitoring (RM) of implantable defibrillators (ICD). Our study aimed at assessing current direct costs of 1‐year ICD follow‐up based on RM compared with conventional quarterly in‐hospital follow‐ups. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (N = 233) with indications for ICD were consecutively recruited and randomized at implant to be followed up for 1 year with standard quarterly in‐hospital visits or by RM with one in‐hospital visit at 12 months, unless additional in‐hospital visits were required due to specific patient conditions or RM alarms. Costs were calculated distinguishing between provider and patient costs, excluding RM device and service cost. The frequency of scheduled in‐hospital visits was lower in the RM group than in the control arm. Follow‐up required 47 min per patient/year in the RM arm versus 86 min in the control arm (p = 0.03) for involved physicians, generating cost estimates for the provider of USD 45 and USD 83 per patient/year, respectively. Costs for nurses were comparable. Overall, the costs associated with RM and standard follow‐up were USD 103 ± 27 and 154 ± 21 per patient/year, respectively (p = 0.01). RM was cost‐saving for the patients: USD 97 ± 121 per patient/year in the RM group versus 287 ± 160 per patient/year (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The time spent by the hospital staff was significantly reduced in the RM group. If the costs for the device and service are not charged to patients or the provider, patients could save about USD 190 per patient/year while the hospital could save USD 51 per patient/year.

AB: Background and aims: By eliminating travel to headache specialist, telemedicine may offer significant time and money savings. The aim of this study was to estimate cost‐effectiveness and investigate feasibility of telemedicine consultations in diagnosing and treating primary headaches in a far‐flung area. Methods: From September 2012 to March 2015, headache patients referred to neurologist were screened for study participation, and randomized to either telemedicine or traditional specialist consultation at the neurologic department in Tromso University hospital. Based on structured interviews and recorded administrative data, outcomes were compared between the groups. Rural patients were compared to urban patients also. Results: Of 557 headache patients screened, 479 were found eligible, and 402 included in the final analyses: 202 received traditional specialist consultation and 200 received telemedicine consultation. The groups were comparable in headache diagnostics and follow‐up, as well as in investigation‐, advice‐, and prescription practice. Virtually all patients were satisfied with sound and video quality. Telemedicine consultations were shorter than traditional visits (38.8 versus 43.7 minutes, p<0.001). In rural areas, the median travel cost per individual was 249 (33‐442), and estimated lost income was 234 per visit. The median travelling distance for rural patients was 526 km (28‐1920), and the median travelling time was 7.8 hours (0.7‐27.3). Patients from rural areas had longer waiting time than urban patients (64 vs. 47 days, p=0.001), and fewer women were referred (p=0.036). Conclusion: Our study documents telemedicine as a cost‐effective and feasible alternative to traditional consultations for primary headaches.

AB: Objective: In two randomized controlled trials Titov et al. demonstrated significant benefit from an Internet‐ and email‐based treatment programme for social phobia: the Shyness programme. Data are presented about the longer term outcomes (6 months after treatment), cost‐effectiveness relative to face‐to‐face treatment, and the acceptability of the programme to participants. Method: Participants completed outcome and acceptability questionnaires at 6 months after treatment. Repeated measures analyses of variance were calculated using an intention‐to‐treat design. Cost‐effectiveness in years lived with disability averted were calculated based on between‐group effect sizes. Results: A total of 59% of treatment group participants completed the 6 month follow‐up questionnaires. Between post‐treatment and 6 month follow up participants continued to make improvements in symptoms of social phobia, while maintaining improvements in mood, psychological distress, and disability. At 6 month follow up the mean within‐group effect size (Cohen's d) for the two social phobia measures increased from 1.2 to 1.4. Cost‐effectiveness in years lived with disability (YLD) averted was calculated as one‐quarter that of face‐to‐face group treatment, or $AUD1495 for one YLD gained, compared to $AUD5686/YLD gained. Participants rated the Internet treatment to be as effective and helpful as face‐to‐face treatment. Conclusions: The present results confirm the reliability of the short‐term findings reported in the first two Shyness programmes. The procedure appears to be very cost‐effective, and acceptable to participants. These data provide further support for the development of Internet‐based virtual clinics for common mental disorders.

AB: Traumas of either physical (shocks, ballistic impacts etc.) or surgical origin are accompanied by acute pain which disappears in most cases with tissue healing. However, in some instances pain may persist in spite of an apparently normal tissue repair. Many reports have pointed to the societal impact of these neuropathic pains which is a major public health problem in Europe and in the world. In addition to the degradation of the quality of individual life that affects hedonistic, emotional, social, professional etc. dimensions of life, the economic cost to society is considerable (treatment costs, work absenteeism, loss of motivation and concentration, etc.) Among these pains, PPTTN resulting from orofacial nerve damage after physical or surgical trauma are little studied. Some studies suggest a high prevalence, ranging from 0.5 to 12% after oral surgery, including endodontic treatment (root canal treatment), simple or complex dental extractions like wisdom teeth, dental implants, and surgical interventions (cyst removal, orthognathic surgery etc.). However, despite significant advances in recent decades, pathophysiological mechanisms of these pains are still largely unknown. The majority of these pains are clinically resistant to standard analgesics and therefore extremely difficult to treat, particularly for trigeminal pain. Understanding these pains is of major interest to determine new strategies and therapeutic targets. Symptomatology and Pathophysiology The main complaint of patients is moderate to severe and usually burning but may be stabbing. Most cases are continuous, but may report superimposed paroxysmal pain attacks. Less frequently, the pain may be short lasting with associated mechanical trigger areas, mimicking trigeminal idiopathic neuralgia. However, even in these cases, the pain attacks are usually longer than those associated with trigeminal neuralgia. Pain is unilateral and may be precisely located to the dermatome of the affected nerve with demonstrable sensory dysfunction. The pain may be diffuse and spread across dermatomes, but rarely crosses the midline. Patients may complain of a feeling of swelling, foreign body, hot or cold, local redness or flushing. Non‐painful but annoying dysesthesias such as itching, numbness, etc. are often present. From a pathophysiological point of view, the development of painful symptoms after peripheral nerve injury is related to peripheral and central changes. Damaged tissue initiate peripheral changes at the injury site that result in functional changes of neuronal, glial and vascular cells, followed by ganglionic and central changes. These changes modify both the functioning and the excitability of individual neurons and the configuration of synaptic networks, at the spinal cord/ brainstem and brain levels. These events in turn lead to genetic and epigenetic changes which translate as long term alterations of neuronal phenotypes Our research group (Team "Neuroinflammation Pain and Stress", U894, Psychiatry Centre and Neurosciences.) has been involved for many years in deciphering the actors and events contributing to the development of post‐traumatic neuropathic pain, in both spinal and trigeminal models. Treatment The diagnostic difficulty is a therapeutic challenge. During the many consultations (average of 7.5 practitioners visited), patients received different treatments: surgical, antidepressant, analgesic or alternative which are often ineffective and potentially iatrogenic and often need to be complemented by a psychotherapeutic approach. The surgical management of patients with neuropathic pain is controversial. Indeed, the long term results of micro‐neurosurgical procedures are often anecdotal, highly variable, and operator‐dependent. In addition they are difficult to assess because studies are rare and involve only few patients. A thorough evaluation of these techniques is necessary and many other authors recommend stopping any surgical procedure at the site of pain and contraindicate surgery. These could indeed worsen the patient's pain. Pharmacological treatment of PPTTN is the same as for post traumatic spinal neuropathic pain. It is symptomatic, not curative, and combines systemic medical treatment with topical treatment (anesthetics). Neuropathic pain responds little or not at all to the classical analgesics like acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and are treated by other therapeutic classes. Current treatments are based on the recommendations of different scientific societies, French (SFETD), European (EFNS) and American (APS). Treatments usually used are tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioids and inhibitors of the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. However these treatments induce many adverse effects more or less tolerated, sometimes leading to treatment discontinuation or dose reductions and impaired efficiency. In conclusion, the diagnosis of PPTTN is difficult and is often made after extensive consultations in specialized centers. The management is unsatisfactory due to the complexity of physio‐pathogenic mechanisms and the lack of specific drugs. It is most often performed by specialized practitioners and uses multidisciplinary skills (dentist, neurologist, psychiatrist and psychologist). Hypothesis for the study Since its introduction in the 1970s for the treatment of strabismus, blepharospasm, and focal dystonia, botulinum toxin type A (BTX‐A) has been widely used in the treatment of conditions characterized by excessive muscle contraction and/or involvement of the cholinergic system (focal dystonia, spasticity, abnormal sphincter contractions, eye movement, hyperkinetic and vegetative disorders). Many studies have also been conducted in the case of painful conditions with a muscular component following a pioneer work observing a significant decrease in pain after BTX injection. Other studies have also reported pain relief during several weeks. The neurotoxin has been used in other types of pain disorders including myofascial pain, blepharospasm, myalgia of the masticatory system (TMD), back pain, painful myoclonia, urologic, rectal or pelvic pain and cervicogenic, neurovascular and tension type headaches, and migraine. The results depend on conditions and on the dose used. It is at the Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) that the action of botulinum neurotoxin has been the most studied. It blocks the release of acetylcholine and causes a reversible deafferentation of the motor endplate (28 days). A first recovery occurs by sprouting and the restoration of function in the initial innervation and loss of sprouts. Full recovery is achieved in about 90 days. However, this sole effect appears insufficient to explain all of the analgesic activity of the neurotoxin, demonstrated in numerous animal studies and therapeutic clinical trials.Effects on nociceptive system The effects of the neurotoxin can also be explained by effects other than on the neuromuscular system, including the nociceptive system. BTX affects the vesicular release of neurotransmitters / neuromodulators. The analgesic effect may be explained by a peripheral action by blocking the axon reflex that releases usually neuropeptides (substance P, neurokinin A, CGRP) by small diameter type C primary afferent nerve fibers and causes the phenomena of neurogenic inflammation including vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. BTX inhibits the release of substance P and glutamate and reduces the inflammatory pain induced by formalin injection. In addition, the toxin can be captured by nerve endings and transported by retrograde and orthograde axonal transport to remote sites, at the level of primary afferents termination site for example or at other sites of neuronal interaction with glial cells or other neuronal types. BoNT can therefore inhibit the release of algogenic neurotransmitters present in nociceptive primary afferent (SP, glutamate) both peripherally and centrally. BTX also decreases the expression of TRPV1 receptors on the membrane surface of nociceptors in animals, and humans. These receptors are involved in the transduction of thermal information and their activation results in a burning sensation, which is also a frequently encountered qualitative characteristic in post‐traumatic neuropathic pain. Recently it has been shown that administration of BTX decreases the expression of TRPV1 in dorsal root ganglion neurons in a diabetic model of neuropathic pain. Finally, the toxin also decreases the expression of other pain receptors such as purinergic receptors P2X3. In humans, the intradermal injection of BTX‐A in healthy volunteers resulted in a marked decrease in specific and painful mechanical sensitivity without changing the tactile, non nociceptive mechanoreception, without affecting the density of cutaneous innervation. Injected in the painful area, BTX‐A might therefore inhibit the release of algogenic neurotransmitters, at both the peripheral and central levels and thus reduce pain. The proposed study will therefore explore in a double blind randomized, with two parallel groups, BTX‐A vs placebo, the analgesic effects of BTX‐A in PPTTN patients.

AB: BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that telephone interventions designed to promote patients' self‐management skills and improve patient‐physician communication can increase patients' satisfaction and their use of preventive services. The effect of such a strategy on health care costs remains controversial. METHODS: We conducted a stratified, randomized study of 174,120 subjects to assess the effect of a telephone‐based care‐management strategy on medical costs and resource utilization. Health coaches contacted subjects with selected medical conditions and predicted high health care costs to instruct them about shared decision making, self‐care, and behavioral change. The subjects were randomly assigned to either a usual‐support group or an enhanced‐support group. Although the same telephone intervention was delivered to the two groups, a greater number of subjects in the enhanced‐support group were made eligible for coaching through the lowering of cutoff points for predicted future costs and expansion of the number of qualifying health conditions. Primary outcome measures at 1 year were total medical costs and number of hospital admissions. RESULTS: At baseline, medical costs and resource utilization were similar in the two groups. After 12 months, 10.4% of the enhanced‐support group and 3.7% of the usual‐support group received the telephone intervention. The average monthly medical and pharmacy costs per person in the enhanced‐support group were 3.6% ($7.96) lower than those in the usual‐support group ($213.82 vs. $221.78, P=0.05); a 10.1% reduction in annual hospital admissions (P<0.001) accounted for the majority of savings. The cost of this intervention program was less than $2.00 per person per month. CONCLUSIONS: A targeted telephone care‐management program was successful in reducing medical costs and hospitalizations in this population‐based study.

AB: Objectives To assess the effect of telecare on health related quality of life, self‐care, hospital use, costs and the experiences of patients, informal carers and health care professionals. Methods Patients were randomly assigned either to usual care or to additionally entering their data into a commercially‐available electronic device that uploaded data once a day to a nurse‐led monitoring station. Patients had congestive heart failure (Site A), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Site B), or any long‐term condition,mostly diabetes (Site C). Site C contributed only intervention patients‐they considered a usual care option to be unethical. The study took place in New Zealand between September 2010 and February 2012, and lasted 3 to 6 months for each patient. The primary outcome was health‐related quality of life (SF36). Data on experiences were collected by individual and group interviews and by questionnaire. Results There were 171 patients (98 intervention, 73 control). Quality of life, self‐efficacy and disease‐specific measures did not change significantly, while anxiety and depression both decreased significantly with the intervention. Hospital admissions, days in hospital, emergency department visits, outpatient visits and costs did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients at all sites were universally positive. Many felt safer and more caredfor, and said that they and their family had learned more about managing their condition. Staff could all see potential benefits of telecare, and, after some initial technical problems, many staff felt that telecare enabled them to effectively monitor more patients. Conclusions Strongly positive patient and staff experiences and attitudes complement and contrast with small or non‐significant quantitative changes. Telecare led to patients and families taking a more active role in self‐management. It is likely that subgroups of patients benefitted in ways that were not measured or visible within the quantitative data, especially feelings of safety and being cared‐for.

AB: Purpose: To investigate whether telephone‐based continuing care (TEL) is a promising alternative to traditional face‐to‐face counseling for clients in treatment for substance abuse. Methods: Patients with alcohol and/or cocaine dependence who had completed a 4‐week intensive outpatient program were randomly assigned through urn randomization into one of three 12‐week interventions: standard continuing care (STD), in‐person relapse prevention (RP), or telephone‐based continuing care (TEL). This study performed cost, cost‐effectiveness, and cost‐benefit analyses of TEL and RP compared to STD, using results from the randomized clinical trial with two years of follow up (359 participants). In addition, the study examined the potential moderating effect of baseline patient costs on economic outcomes. Results: The study found that TEL was less expensive per client from the societal perspective ($569) than STD ($870) or RP ($1684). TEL also was also significantly more effective, with an abstinence rate of 57.1% compared to 46.7% for STD (p< 0.05). Thus TEL dominated STD, with a highly favorable negative incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (‐$1400 per abstinent year). TEL also proved favorable under a benefit‐cost perspective. Conclusions: TEL proved to be a cost‐effective and cost‐beneficial contributor to long‐term recovery over two years. Because TEL dominated STD care interventions, wider adoption should be considered.

AB: Focal points • Non‐adherence to long‐term medicines is one of the most significant challenges facing health care systems, but remains resistant to being addressed. • There is evidence to suggest that pharmacists are well placed to provide adherence interventions. • This randomised controlled trial showed that it is feasible, effective and acceptable to patients to provide tailored adherence support, using a combination of telephone consultations and written information. • The findings provide support for the enhanced role of pharmacists in supporting and advising patients with their medicines to improve adherence outcomes. Introduction Non‐adherence to medicines for long‐term conditions is a complex and prevalent phenomenon, with significant clinical and economic consequences for patients and health providers worldwide. Simple effective solutions have eluded researchers over many decades. Pharmacists in the UK are increasingly involved in the provision of a wide variety of interventions to support medication taking and there is a small but growing body of research evaluating their role in this domain.1 This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a pharmacist‐led intervention to improve medication adherence, in the context of a mail‐order pharmacy. The intervention was adapted and refined from an existing intervention subsequently adopted as the NHS‐funded New Medicine Service.2 Methods A parallel‐group randomised controlled trial was conducted. 677 patients prescribed at least one oral medication for type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or lipid regulation were recruited from a UK mail‐order pharmacy between Nov 2012 and Sept 2013. Participants were randomised equally between the intervention and control group, in blocks of four, using a computer generated random number sequence (340 intervention, 337 control). Groups were similar in terms of all sociodemographic, clinical and medication‐related variables measured at baseline. The intervention was delivered by a pharmacist and was patient‐centred, comprising of three main components: • Two telephone consultations with a pharmacist, four to six weeks apart. • A written summary of the discussion. • Amedicines reminder chart. All elements of the intervention were tailored to the individuals' needs. The primary outcome was self‐reported adherence to medication at four‐week follow up, measured using the Diagnostic Adherence to Medication Scale (DAMS). Preliminary validation suggests adherence ratings using the DAM Scorrelate with other validated self‐report measures.3 Binary logistic regression was conducted according to the intention‐to‐treat principle. Multiple imputation was used to deal with missing data (78 participants lost to follow up) and all 677 participants were included in the primary analysis. Patient satisfaction with the intervention was a secondary outcome. The study was approved by the London Brent Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 12/LO/1657). Results More than 90% of the intervention group completed the intervention. Initial consultation calls lasted a median of 17 minutes; follow‐up calls 7 minutes, and the median length of time between calls was 35 days. Patients who received the intervention had more than twice the adjusted odds of being adherent (defined as ≥90% of medication taken in the past seven days) at four week follow up, compared to the control group (OR 2.20 95%CI 1.33 to 3.65, p = .002). Satisfaction with the intervention was high, with 91.8% (n = 245) agreeing that they were satisfied overall, and just four participants (1.5%) expressing any dissatisfaction. Discussion The high number of satisfied patients who completed the intervention shows that it is acceptable to patients. The intervention, led by a pharmacist and tailored to the individuals' needs, significantly improved medication adherence in patients with long‐term conditions. It comprised both spoken and written information, including a reminder chart. The findings provide further support for the enhanced role of pharmacists in supporting and advising patients with their medicines, and improving adherence outcomes. Data has also been collected at six months and is currently being analysed.

AB: BACKGROUND: The role of telemedicine in the management of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that multidisciplinary comprehensive HF care could achieve better results when it is delivered using telemedicine. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 178 eligible patients with HF were randomized to either structured follow‐up on the basis of face‐to‐face encounters (control group, 97 patients) or delivering health care using telemedicine (81 patients). Telemedicine included daily signs and symptoms based on telemonitoring and structured follow‐up by means of video or audio‐conference. The primary end‐point was non‐fatal HF events after six months of follow‐up. The median age of the patients was 77 years, 41% were female, and 25% were frail patients. The hazard ratio for the primary end‐point was 0.35 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20‐0.59; p‐value < 0.001) in favour of telemedicine. HF readmission (hazard ratio 0.39 (0.19‐0.77); p‐value=0.007) and cardiovascular readmission (hazard ratio 0.43 (0.23‐0.80); p‐value=0.008) were also reduced in the telemedicine group. Mortality was similar in both groups (telemedicine: 6.2% vs control: 12.4%, p‐value > 0.05). The telemedicine group experienced a significant mean net reduction in direct hospital costs of €3546 per patient per six months of follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients managed in the setting of a comprehensive HF programme, the addition of telemedicine may result in better outcomes and reduction of costs.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of telecare on health related quality of life, self‐care, hospital use, costs and the experiences of patients, informal carers and health care professionals. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned either to usual care or to additionally entering their data into a commercially‐available electronic device that uploaded data once a day to a nurse‐led monitoring station. Patients had congestive heart failure (Site A), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Site B), or any long‐term condition, mostly diabetes (Site C). Site C contributed only intervention patients ‐ they considered a usual care option to be unethical. The study took place in New Zealand between September 2010 and February 2012, and lasted 3 to 6 months for each patient. The primary outcome was health‐related quality of life (SF36). Data on experiences were collected by individual and group interviews and by questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 171 patients (98 intervention, 73 control). Quality of life, self‐efficacy and disease‐specific measures did not change significantly, while anxiety and depression both decreased significantly with the intervention. Hospital admissions, days in hospital, emergency department visits, outpatient visits and costs did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients at all sites were universally positive. Many felt safer and more cared‐for, and said that they and their family had learned more about managing their condition. Staff could all see potential benefits of telecare, and, after some initial technical problems, many staff felt that telecare enabled them to effectively monitor more patients. CONCLUSIONS: Strongly positive patient and staff experiences and attitudes complement and contrast with small or non‐significant quantitative changes. Telecare led to patients and families taking a more active role in self‐management. It is likely that subgroups of patients benefitted in ways that were not measured or visible within the quantitative data, especially feelings of safety and being cared‐for.

AB: Background: As demands for rehabilitation services are growing, new alternatives such as tele‐rehabilitation are emerging. In particular, today's reality of an aging population, the lack of health care professionals and the distance (sometimes great!) between the patient's home and the health care center, in‐home tele‐rehabilitation is becoming a targeted rehabilitation delivery method. However, no robust data yet exist concerning both its efficacy and use related costs. Purpose: As part of a multi‐centre RCT on the effectiveness of in‐home tele‐rehabilitation, this economic analysis aims to analyse and compare the costs related to in‐home tele‐rehabilitation (TELE) with conventional home visits (VISIT) following knee replacement surgery (total knee arthroplasty [TKA]). Methods: Patients were recruited from eight hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada. The cost analysis was performed with 197 participants randomly assigned to either the TELE (97 participants) and the VISIT group (100 participants). Both groups received the same rehabilitation intervention consisting of 16 supervised exercise sessions, twice a week, over the two first months after hospital discharge. The only difference is the service delivery method. The TELE group intervention was delivered by videoconferencing over high‐speed Internet and the VISIT group received the same intervention, but face‐to‐face at home. Costs related to the delivery of the two services (TELE and VISIT) were calculated. Student's t‐tests were used to compare costs per treatment between the two groups. The distance was accounted for by comparing the two treatment groups within distance strata using two‐way analyses of variance (ANOVA). Results: The mean cost (in Canadian dollars) of a single session was $93.08 for the VISIT group (SD = $35.70) and $80.99 for the TELE group (SD = $26.60). When comparing both groups, real total cost analysis showed a cost differential in favor of the TELE group (TELE‐VISIT: ‐$263; 95% CI: (‐$382, ‐$143)). However, when the patient's home was located less than 30 km round‐trip from the health care center, the difference in costs between TELE and VISIT treatments was not significant (P values of .25, .26 and .11 for the <10, 10‐19 and 20‐29 km strata, respectively). The cost of TELE treatments was lower than VISIT treatments when the distance was 30 km or more (30‐49 km: $81 < $103, P value = .002; >50 km: $90 < $152, P value < .0001). Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the first study that analyses real costs of in‐home tele‐rehabilitation covering all sub‐costs related to tele‐rehabilitation (equipment amortization, installation/uninstallation, technical problems related to tele‐treatment) and distance between the health care centre and the patient's home. The cost for a single session of TELE compared to VISIT was lower or about the same, depending on the distance between the patient's home and the health care centre. Implications: In addition to the main conclusion of the RCT (non‐inferiority of tele‐rehabilitation vs conventional in home rehabilitation), these economic data fill a void in the tele‐rehabilitation field. Henceforth, managers will be better informed in their decision‐making process regarding the introduction of tele‐rehabilitation as a new service in their clinic.

DOI: 10.1093/humrep/29.Supplement_1.1
AB: Study question: Does self‐operated endo‐vaginal tele‐monitoring (SOET, S) (patients perform sonograms themselves at home) of the ovarian stimulation phase in IVF/ICSI produce similar laboratory, clinical, patient reported and health‐economic results as traditional monitoring (non‐SOET, NS) (patients come to the centre for sonograms)? Summary answer: S is not inferior to traditional monitoring (NS) because the numbers of (metaphase‐II) oocytes (=primary outcome), good quality embryos, total pregnancies, ongoing pregnancies and embryos to freeze are similar and because S patients feel more contented, less stressed and more empowered than NS patients at a lower societal cost. What is known already: Monitoring the follicular phase is needed to adapt gonadotrophin dose, detect threatening hyperstimulation and plan HCG‐administration. In current practice, patients pay visits to care providers, entailing transportation costs and productivity loss. It stresses patients, partners, care providers and the environment. Patients living at great distance from IVF centres have more difficult access to treatment. Logistics and stress of the follicular phase of ART is often an impediment for treatment. Home monitoring provides a patient‐centered alternative. Study design, size, duration: Non‐inferiority RCT between S and NS. Sample size calculations based on n of metaphase‐II oocytes at retrieval showed 100 patients needed in each study arm. This also allows comparing patient reported outcomes and health‐economic data. Running time: 20 months. Block randomization; allocation concealment through electronic clinical research files. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Inclusion criteria: <41 years, ICSI, no poor response, two ovaries. Small PC with USB connected vaginal probe; specific web site application. Sonographic training at the centre. 185 eligible patients recruited in four centres: 123 randomized; 121 completed S (n = 59) or NS (n = 62); 62/185 (33%) eligible patients declined participation for various reasons. Main results and the role of chance: Patient characteristics comparable. Clinic: Positive acceptance by 2/3 of eligible study patients. No clinical complications. Similar conceptions (P = 0.47) and ongoing pregnancies (P = 1.00). Laboratory: Similar n of follicles >15 mm at OPU, ova at OPU, metaphase II oocytes (S:9.6 +/‐ 5.5; NS:9.4 +/‐ 6.7)(p = 0.27), log2 n metaphase II oocytes, embryos available at ET, excellent embryos and embryos frozen. PRO: S (n = 56) showed significantly higher contentedness in patients and partners, higher feeling of empowerment, discretion, and partner participation; and a trend towards less stress than NS (n = 61). Comparing S patients with previous NS attempts (n = 39) showed significant differences in favour of S for all outcome variables (p < 0.001). HE analysis: S resulted in less productivity loss (p < 0.001), lower transportation cost (p < 0.001), lower sonograms and consultation costs (p < 0.001), but higher personnel cost than NS. Limitations, reason for caution: Non‐inferiority of S versus NS can be concluded. Study ended before sample size was reached due to external circumstances (end of financial support) but conclusions are statistically valid. Higher personnel cost artificially induced by study setting (time for randomization, explanation). Wider implications of the findings: The concept of SOET works. ART sonograms can be made and sent, received and analysed anytime and anywhere wifi is available. This approach offers advantages: similar results with less logistical stress, at lower cost, decreasing environmental impact, empowering patients in urban western settings, increasing and facilitating access to treatment in large countries, allowing disconnection between monitoring and laboratory facilities, improving the role of reproductive midwives in ART, bringing care towards patients in poor resource settings.

AB: INTRODUCTION: The reduction of healthcare costs and societal cost due to remote monitoring (RM) of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) has been demonstrated in several countries; however, to the best of our knowledge it does not exist for South Korea. This work aims at providing an estimation of the potential benefit of RM versus standard care (SC) of CIEDs in term of healthcare costs in South Korea, in order to provide additional substance to the currently ongoing societal debate about the value of telemedicine. METHODS: Healthcare resource consumption was taken from the results of the TARIFF study, a prospective, non‐randomized, multicenter clinical trial designed in Italy to assess the economic benefits of RM follow‐up in comparison with standard follow‐up in 209 patients (107 SC, 102 RM). The main results demonstrated that RM reduced healthcare resource consumption by 54 percent from a healthcare services perspective (SC: EUR1,044.89+/‐1,990.47 versus RM: EUR482.87+/‐2488.10, p<.0001 (1). In order to perform a cost analysis from the perspective of the South Korean healthcare payer, the following unit costs were assigned to resources collected in TARIFF (hospitalizations, visits, examinations): fee‐for‐service tariffs, emergency tariffs and outpatient tariffs. Remote follow‐up costs were considered as zero. RESULTS: From the perspective of the South Korean healthcare payer, the overall mean annual cost/patient in the RM group is 53 percent lower than in SC group (SC: EUR405,439+/‐40,135 versus RM: EUR189,96+/‐725,52, p<.0001) (SC: KRW497,145+/‐49,2137 versus RM: KRW 232,936+/‐890,181, p<.0001). This is mainly due to a significant cost reduction in device‐related hospitalizations, examination tests and visits in the follow‐up period. CONCLUSIONS: RM of CIED patients is cost‐saving from the perspective of the South Korean healthcare system. Introducing appropriate reimbursement for remote monitoring of CIED is not likely to change this result and should make RM sustainable for the provider and encourage widespread adoption of RM.

AB: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), but treatment compliance is often unsatisfactory. This study investigated the efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of telemonitoring for improving CPAP compliance.100 newly diagnosed OSA patients requiring CPAP (apnoea‐hypopnoea index >15 events·h‐1) were randomised to standard management or a telemonitoring programme that collected daily information about compliance, air leaks and residual respiratory events, and initiated patient contact to resolve issues. Clinical/anthropometric variables, daytime sleepiness and quality of life were recorded at baseline and after 3 months. Patient satisfaction, additional visits/calls, side‐effects and total costs were assessed.There were no significant differences between the standard and telemedicine groups in terms of CPAP compliance (4.9±2.2 versus 5.1±2.1 h·night‐1), symptoms, clinical variables, quality of life and unwanted effects. Telemedicine was less expensive than standard management (EUR123.65 versus EUR170.97; p=0.022) and was cost‐effective (incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio EUR17 358.65 per quality‐adjusted life‐year gained). Overall patient satisfaction was high, but significantly more patients rated satisfaction as high/very high in the standard management versus telemedicine group (96% versus 74%; p=0.034).Telemonitoring did not improve CPAP treatment compliance and was associated with lower patient satisfaction. However, it was more cost‐effective than traditional follow‐up.

Telemedicine was less expensive than standard management (EUR123.65 versus EUR170.97; p=0.022) and was cost‐effective (incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio EUR17358.65 per quality‐Adjusted life‐year gained). Overall patient satisfaction was high, but significantly more patients rated satisfaction as high/very high in the standard management versus telemedicine group (96% versus 74%; p=0.034). Telemonitoring did not improve CPAP treatment compliance and was associated with lower patient satisfaction. However, it was more cost‐effective than traditional follow‐up. Copyright © ERS 2017.

KY: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2
AB: Severity of diabetes is related to the development of disabling and costly complications (12.9 billion euros in 2007). The French High Health Authority recommends a therapeutic education on lifestyle and dietary rules in first‐line treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Despite these recommendations, patients often have difficulties to implement dietary recommendations every day. The objective of EDUC@DOM is to help people with diabetes to improve lifestyle and equilibrium of glycaemia in order to avoid or delay chronic complications of diabetes. Our main goal is to assess effectiveness of our telemonitoring program in type 2 patients' care compared to a usual care of diabetes, on the glycaemia of the patients. It is expected that our program leads to a better monitoring of health status, a greater adherence to medical and non‐medical prescriptions, an empowerment of the patient, and as a consequence, a more efficient health care consumption.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a telephone intervention to improve quality of life among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. METHODS: Single‐site recruitment of 458 patients using Veterans Health Administration care into a randomized controlled trial with a 1‐year preintervention data collection period and a 1‐year intervention and follow‐up period. To compensate for imbalanced study groups, propensity scores were included in adjusted models of quality of life, satisfaction with care, inpatient utilization, survival, and costs of care. RESULTS: Patients aged 45 to 95 years participated in the study; 22% were of Hispanic race/ethnicity, and 7% were African American. All but 5 were male, consistent with the older population among veterans. At baseline, 40% were in Goldman Specific Activity Scale class I, 42% were in class III, 6% were in class II or IV, and 12% were unclassified. Patients scored a mean (SD) of 14 (1.5) points below the norm on the physical component score. After the yearlong intervention, no differences in clinical outcomes were noted between the intervention group and the control group. The CHF‐related costs were higher for the intervention group, as were overall costs that included the cost of the intervention. Intervention group patients reported better compliance with weight monitoring and exercise recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: A risk‐stratified intervention for patients with CHF resulted in potential behavioral improvements but no survival benefit. A high‐cost high‐intensity intervention may be required to improve survival for patients with CHF. Inclusion of the costs of interventions is recommended for future researchers.

AB: OBJECTIVE: In the SAVE‐trial we evaluated the safety, reliability and improvements of patient management using the BIOTRONIK Home Monitoring®‐System (HM) in pacemaker (PM) and implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients. DESIGN: 115 PM (Module A) and 36 ICD‐patients (Module B) were recruited 3 months after implantation. PATIENTS: 65 patients in Module A were randomised to HM‐OFF and had one scheduled outpatient clinic follow‐up(FU) per year, whereas patients randomised to HM‐ON were equipped with the mobile transmitter and discharged without any further scheduled in‐office FU. In Module B 18 patients were randomised to HM‐OFF and followed by standard outpatient clinic controls every 6 months; 18 patients were randomised to HM‐ON receiving remote monitoring plus one outpatient clinic visit per year; unscheduled follow‐ups were performed when necessary. RESULTS: The average follow‐up period was 17.1 ± 9.2 months in Module A and 26.3 ± 8.6 months in Module B. In both modules, the number of FUs per year was significantly reduced (Module A HM‐ON 0.29 ± 0.6 FUs/year vs HM‐OFF 0.53 ± 0.5 FUs/year; p b 0.001; Module B HM‐ON 0.87 ± 0.25 vs HM‐OFF 1.73 ± 0.53 FU/year,p b 0.001). Cost analysis was significantly lower in the HM‐ON group compared to the HM‐OFF group (18.0 ± 41.3 and 22.4 ± 26.9 € respectively; p b 0.003). 93% of the unscheduled visits in Module B were clinically indicated,whereas 55% of the routine FUs were classified as clinically unnecessary. CONCLUSION: Remote home monitoring of pacemaker and ICD devices was safe, reduced overall hospital visits, and detected events that mandated unscheduled visits.

AB: Introduction: Remote monitoring (RM) systems can replace ambulatory follow‐ups, sparing human and economic resources, and increasing patient safety. Purpose: quantify the safety and cost saving of a remote monitoring system for ICD recipients in a"real world" single centre setting. Methods: we collected and compared data from 150 patients with a previously implanted ICD (between April 2008 and February 2012) randomly assigned to a conventional follow‐up (75 patients) or to a RM system (75 patients). The characteristics of the study groups were similar (p < 0,05): first group 64 males and 11 females; the mean age of the patients was 68 +/‐ 12 years; second group 63 males and 12 females; 68 +/‐ 12 years mean age. The indication for the ICD implantation was secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in 8 (5%) patients and primary prevention in 142 (94,6%) patients. Regarding etiology 96 patients (64%) had prior myocardial infarction while 54 (36%) had dilated cardiomyopathy. Most of the patients were in stable clinical condition (NYHA 1 or 2);mean LVEF was 28,9% vs 31,5% respectively. Results: After 6 months of follow‐up we observed that emergency room visits were 25% less frequent in the RM arm, 17 patients of group 1 and 22 of the group 2 needed hospitalization for a cardiac cause (heart failure, arrhythmias, or ICD‐related events). The duration was 12,7 +/‐ 8,4 days for conventionally vs 8 +/‐ 5,3 days for RM group (p< 0,05). RM also lowered the number of patients (12 vs 17) who underwent further hospitalizations. The cost of remote follow‐up for 100 ICD patients/year was calculated to be E44,267, or about 16% of the cost of conventional in‐clinic follow‐up. It provides a tremendous convenience for patients and clinicians and reduces the cost of follow‐up. Although the technology is not intended to replace direct patient contacts completely, it can indeed release resources and help to maintain proactive patient care. Although our experience has been favourable, many practical issues remain. In particular, more information is required on the feasibility and safety of remote monitoring for patient‐initiated transmissions and cost‐effectiveness of the system as a substitute for routine in‐office visits during long‐term follow‐up. Conclusions: The trend of our data shows a considerable saving of days of hospitalization, emergency room admittance and resources. Due to the small number of patients in our study and the shortness of follow‐up we deduce that real clinical and health economics impact of remote monitoring needs to be verified by a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial.

AB: BACKGROUND: Cost consequences analysis was completed from randomized controlled trial (RCT) data for the Just‐in‐time (JIT) librarian consultation service in primary care that ran from October 2005 to April 2006. The service was aimed at providing answers to clinical questions arising during the clinical encounter while the patient waits. Cost saving and cost avoidance were also analyzed. The data comes from eighty‐eight primary care providers in the Ottawa area working in Family Health Networks (FHNs) and Family Health Groups (FHGs). METHODS: We conducted a cost consequences analysis based on data from the JIT project. We also estimated the potential economic benefit of JIT librarian consultation service to the health care system. RESULTS: The results show that the cost per question for the JIT service was $38.20. The cost could be as low as $5.70 per question for a regular service. Nationally, if this service was implemented and if family physicians saw additional patients when the JIT service saved them time, up to 61,100 extra patients could be seen annually. A conservative estimate of the cost savings and cost avoidance per question for JIT was $11.55. CONCLUSIONS: The cost per question, if the librarian service was used at full capacity, is quite low. Financial savings to the health care system might exceed the cost of the service. Saving physician's time during their day could potentially lead to better access to family physicians by patients. Implementing a librarian consultation service can happen quickly as the time required to train professional librarians to do this service is short.

AB: Introduction The aim of this study was to assess the impact of home‐based telehealth monitoring on health outcomes, quality of life and costs over 12 months for patients with diabetes and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who were identified as being at high risk of readmission to hospital. Methods This pilot study was a randomised controlled trial combined with an economic analysis to examine the outcomes of standard care versus home‐based telehealth for people with diabetes and/or COPD who were at risk of hospital readmission within one year. The primary outcomes were (i) hospital admission and length of stay (LOS); and (ii) health‐related quality of life (HRQOL); and the secondary outcomes were (i) health‐related clinical outcomes; (ii) anxiety and depression scores; and (iii) health literacy. The costs of the intervention and hospitalisations were included. Results A total of 86 and 85 participants were randomised to the intervention and control groups respectively. The difference between groups in hospital LOS was ‐3.89 (95% confidence interval (CI): ‐9.40, 1.62) days, and for HRQOL, 0.09 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.14) in favour of the telehealth monitoring group. There was a saving of AUD$6553 (95% CI: ‐12145, ‐961) in the cost of hospitalisation over 12 months, which offset the increased cost of tele‐monitoring. The intervention group showed an improvement in anxiety, depression and health literacy at 12 months, and in the diabetes group, a reduction in microalbuminuria. Discussion The telehealth monitoring intervention improved patient's health outcomes and quality of life at no additional cost.

AB: Introduction: With the introductions of the Oxygen O2 93% monography in the European Pharmacopoeia, it is now possible to administer this medicinal gas to patients as an alternative to the traditional O2 99%. The ASLTO3, a Public Local Health Service in Piedmont, is the first in Italy to decide to experiment the production of O2 93% at the Venaria Reale Hospital in Turin. Materials and Methods: Since July 2015 (12 months), a Randomized Controlled Trial has been carried out. O2 93% or O2 99% were been randomly administered to the patients hospitalized in General Medicine. Clinical efficacy and management safety were defined as outcomes of the present study. Cost‐efficacy and cost‐efficiency analysis have been performed. Results: The pilot study demonstrated an overlapping of the clinical efficacy (Group O2 93%: 95% flux l/min, 91% SaO2 in range, 92% blood gas analysis T1 in range; Group O2 99%: 97% flux l/min, 90% SaO2, 93% in range, blood gas analysis T1 in range), an absence of chemical alterations and no interruption of supply measured through a remote monitoring. The new system (costs of installation: 39000€) has produced a saving cost of 15000€, already in the first year, compared to the current 55000€ per year for 18000m3 of O2 99% and it would produce a saving cost of 50000 € in the following years, as well as an increase in availability of O2 (32000 m3). Conclusions: O2 93% represents an emerging technology with a clinical and economic impact on the Health Systems with a large‐scale saving costs estimated in 20 million euro per year for Piedmont Region only.

AB: Objective: To assess the feasibility of implementing a dedicated feeding support team on a postnatal ward and pilot the potential effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of team (proactive) and woman‐initiated (reactive) telephone support after discharge. Design: Randomised controlled trial embedded within a before‐and‐after study. Participatory approach and mixed‐method process evaluation. Setting: A postnatal ward in Scotland. Sample: Women living in disadvantaged areas initiating breast feeding. Methods: Eligible women were recruited to a before‐and‐after intervention study, a proportion of whom were independently randomised after hospital discharge to intervention: daily proactive and reactive telephone calls for #14 days or control: reactive telephone calls # day 14. Intention‐to‐treat analysis compared the randomised groups on cases with complete outcomes at follow‐up. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome: any breast feeding at 6‐8 weeks assessed by a telephone call from a researcher blind to group allocation. Secondary outcomes: exclusive breast feeding, satisfaction with care, NHS costs and cost per additional woman breast feeding. Results: There was no difference in feeding outcomes for women initiating breast feeding before the intervention (n=413) and after (n=388). 69 women were randomised to telephone support: 35 intervention (32 complete cases) and 34 control (26 complete cases). 22 intervention women compared with 12 control women were giving their baby some breast milk (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.40) and 17 intervention women compared with eight control women were exclusively breast feeding (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.37) at 6‐8 weeks after birth. The incremental cost of providing proactive calls was £87 per additional woman breast feeding and £91 per additional woman exclusively breast feeding at 6‐8 weeks; costs were sensitive to service organisation. Conclusions: Proactive telephone care delivered by a dedicated feeding team shows promise as a cost‐effective intervention for improving breastfeeding outcomes. Integrating the FEeding Support Team (FEST) intervention into routine postnatal care was feasible.

AB: Rationale: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a proven effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), but treatment compliance is not always satisfactory. This study investigated the efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of telemonitoring for improving compliance with CPAP. Methods: Newly‐diagnosed OSA patients requiring CPAP (apnoea‐hypopnoea index [AHI] >15/h) were randomised to standard management or a telemonitoring programme that collected daily information about compliance, air leaks and residual respiratory events, and initiated patient contact to resolve issues. Clinical/anthropometric variables, daytime sleepiness and quality of life (QOL) were recorded at baseline and after 3 months. Patient satisfaction, additional visits/calls, side effects and total costs were assessed. Results: 100 patients (AHI 52±25/h, 55±13 years, 23% female) were randomised. There were no significant differences between the standard and telemedicine groups in CPAP compliance (4.9±2.2 vs 5.1±2.1 h/night), symptoms, clinical variables, QOL and unwanted effects. Telemedicine was less expensive than standard management (€123.65 vs €170.97; p=0.022) and was cost effective (incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio €17,358.65/quality‐adjusted life‐year gained). Overall patient satisfaction was high, but significantly more patients rated satisfaction as high/very high in the standard management versus telemedicine group (96% vs. 74%; p=0.034). Conclusions: Telemonitoring was not able to improve CPAP treatment compliance and patients' satisfaction compared to standard care, although it proved to be a cost effective option by reducing the number of scheduled visits to the sleep unit while being associated with similar compliance.

AB: Background: We tested the efficacy of a remote tailored intervention Tele‐Cancer Risk Assessment and Evaluation (TeleCARE) compared with a mailed educational brochure for improving colonoscopy uptake among at‐risk relatives of colorectal cancer patients and examined subgroup differences based on participant reported cost barriers. Methods: Family members of colorectal cancer patients who were not up‐to‐date with colonoscopy were randomly assigned as family units to TeleCARE (N = 232) or an educational brochure (N = 249). At the 9‐month follow‐up, a cost resource letter listing resources for free or reduced‐cost colonoscopy was mailed to participants who had reported cost barriers and remained nonadherent. Rates of medically verified colonoscopy at the 15‐month follow‐up were compared on the basis of group assignment and within group stratification by cost barriers. Results: In intent‐to‐treat analysis, 42.7% of participants in TeleCARE and 24.1% of participants in the educational brochure group had a medically verified colonoscopy [OR, 2.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59‐3.52]. Cost was identified as a barrier in both groups (TeleCARE= 62.5%; educational brochure= 57.0%). When cost was not a barrier, the TeleCARE group was almost four times as likely as the comparison to have a colonoscopy (OR, 3.66; 95%CI, 1.85‐7.24). The intervention was efficacious among those who reported cost barriers; the TeleCARE group was nearly twice as likely to have a colonoscopy (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12‐3.52). Conclusions: TeleCARE increased colonoscopy regardless of cost barriers. Impact: Remote interventions may bolster screening colonoscopy regardless of cost barriers and be more efficacious when cost barriers are absent.

AB: Background Finding innovative and cost‐efficient care strategies that induce long‐term health benefits in cardiac patients constitutes a big challenge today. The aim of this Telerehab III follow‐up study was to assess whether a 6‐month additional cardiac telerehabilitation programme could induce long‐term health benefits and remain cost‐efficient after the tele‐intervention ended. Methods and results A total of 126 cardiac patients first completed the multicentre, randomised controlled telerehabilitation trial (Telerehab III, time points t0 to t1). They consequently entered the follow‐up study (t1) with evaluations 2 years later (t2). A quantitative analysis of peak aerobic capacity (VO2 peak, primary endpoint), international physical activity questionnaire self‐reported physical activity and HeartQoL quality of life (secondary endpoints) was performed. The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio was calculated. Even though a decline in VO2 peak (24 ± 8 ml/[min*kg] at t1 and 22 ± 6 ml/[min*kg] at t2; P ≤ 0.001) was observed within the tele‐intervention group patients; overall they did better than the no tele‐intervention group ( P = 0.032). Dividing the incremental cost (‐€878/patient) by the differential incremental quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.22 QALYs) yielded an incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio of ‐€3993/QALY. Conclusions A combined telerehabilitation and centre‐based programme, followed by transitional telerehabilitation induced persistent health benefits and remained cost‐efficient up to 2 years after the end of the intervention. A partial decline of the benefits originally achieved did occur once the tele‐intervention ended. Healthcare professionals should reflect on how innovative cost‐efficient care models could be implemented in standard care. Future research should focus on key behaviour change techniques in technology‐based interventions that enable full persistence of long‐term behaviour change and health benefits. This study is registered in the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN29243064).

AB: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The escalating costs of medical care have required providers to develop efficient, readily available and cost‐effective healthcare delivery models. As such, we performed a prospective randomized trial to investigate the efficiency, acceptability and costs associated with a patient‐physician encounter, in the ambulatory urological setting, using remote video‐visit technology (VV) compared to a traditional office‐visit (OV). METHODS: From June 2013 to March 2014, 55 men with a history of prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer were randomized to an OV or VV. Patients performed VV from home, or work, with the urologist during a standard outpatient clinic. Clinical timing parameters for both study arms were assessed. Following each visit, patients and physicians were surveyed with a standard questionnaire (Likert scale 1 = strongly agree to 7 = strongly disagree). The primary outcome was visit timing efficiency. Secondary outcomes included patient/provider satisfaction and costs incurred. RESULTS: Of the 55 patients enrolled, 28 underwent a VV and 27 an OV. Among men randomized to a VV, relative to an OV, there was equivalence in efficiency including patient‐provider face time (mean 14.5 vs 14.3 minutes; p = 0.96), patient wait time (18.4 vs 13.0 minutes; p = 0.2) and total time devoted to the patient's care (17.9 vs 17.8 minutes; p = 0.97). The mean age of men studied was 62 years (range 44‐79); of whom 96% of VV and 100% of OV responded that they would meet with their provider in the same setting again. There was no significant difference in the patient's perception of visit confidentiality (mean Likert response; 1.1 vs 1.0), efficiency (2.1 vs 1.4), education quality (1.3 vs 1.4) or overall satisfaction (1.2 vs 1.1) between cohorts. Likewise, there was a high level of urologist satisfaction among both VV (88%) and OV (90%). Specifically, 88% of providers rated VV communication quality as very good/excellent. Finally, VV participants incurred significantly less costs, including distance traveled (median 0 vs 95 miles), travel time (0 vs 95 minutes), missed work (0 vs 1 days) and money spent on travel ($0 vs $48) (all p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest equivalent efficiency, similar satisfaction and significantly reduced costs to patients participating in VV. As such, VV in the ambulatory urological setting may have a future role in healthcare delivery by reducing costs, increasing access and enhancing productivity; thus, benefiting the patient, provider, and healthcare system.

AB: Objectives: The prevalence of breast cancer is high and associated with significant economic burden on healthcare systems worldwide. Little is known about patterns of healthcare utilization (HCU) of patients following utilization of telemedical care (TMC). Our aim was to examine HCU of patients with breast cancer one year before and after first utilization of TMC. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted among Maccabi Healthcare Services enrollees that were newly diagnosed with breast cancer during January‐September 2016 and used TMC (n=96). Control subjects who did not use TMC were randomly selected and matched by age, district, disease duration and eligibility to social benefit due to low income, disability or age (n=187). HCU data as well as demographic characteristics and comorbidity burden were obtained from computerized databases. Results: Mean+/‐SD age of the study population was 55.9+/‐10.5 years. No significant differences were found between the study and control groups in prevalence of heart disease (P=0.916), diabetes (P=0.551), hypertension (P=0.969), socioeconomic status (P=0.759), and insurance coverage (P=0.834). Before exposure to TMC (baseline), the average total annual HCU costs of the study group was higher than that of the control group ($8268 vs. $7007, P=0.006), however, a more economically significant difference was found in the year following exposure to TMC ($45251 vs. $23572, P<0.001). Most of the difference stems from 1.73 times higher outpatient visits costs (p<0.001), 3.24 times higher medication costs (P<0.001), and 1.65 times higher hospitalization costs (P=0.044). No significant difference in surgeries costs was found between groups following exposure to TMC (P=0.285). Conclusions: Exposure to TMC increased annual HCU costs one year following it. This may reflect a timelier, thus effective management of the disease. Further research on long‐term HCU and health outcomes of patients with breast cancer following exposure to TMC will enable to examine the cost‐effectiveness of this technology. Copyright © 2018

AB: OBJECTIVE: Our community‐based participatory research partnership previously evaluated Consultation Planning (CP), a question‐listing intervention delivered in‐person. We now report on effectiveness, cost, and value of delivering CP by telephone (Tele‐CP). METHODS: Between 2007 and 2010, we randomly assigned rural women with a diagnosis of breast cancer to receive Tele‐CP or In‐Person CP. We compared ratings of decision self‐efficacy (0 minimum to 4 maximum) with a pre‐specified non‐inferiority margin of 15%. We also explored psychosocial and economic outcomes. RESULTS: Tele‐CP (n=35) recipients reported mean decision self‐efficacy ratings of 3.53 versus 3.44 for in‐person (n=32). Under intent‐to‐treat analysis, we rejected the null hypothesis of greater than 0.52 inferiority for Tele‐CP (95% CI for difference: ‐0.44 to 0.13, p=0.006). The intervention costs averaged $48 for Tele‐CP versus $78 in‐person (95% CI for difference: ‐$63 to $2). Mean willingness‐to‐pay was $154 for Tele‐CP and $144 for in‐person (95% CI for difference: ‐$88 to $108). CONCLUSION: Tele‐CP was non‐inferior to In‐Person CP, cost no more, and was equally valued by patients. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Telephone delivery of Consultation Planning can achieve comparable quality, cost, and value as in‐person. Organizations offering Consultation Planning or similar question‐listing interventions should consider adopting telephone delivery.

AB: Background: The workplace is ideal to encourage habitual physical activity, but little evidence exists on effective behaviour change interventions that lead to sustained behaviour. We aimed to address this gap by evaluating the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of a loyalty‐based intervention on physical activity in public sector employees. Methods: We conducted a cluster randomised wait‐list controlled trial in public sector organisations in Northern Ireland, UK. We randomly assigned clusters (1:1) using a computer‐generated random sequence. Researchers were masked to allocation, but participants were not. Employees aged 18–65 years with no medical contraindications to physical activity were included. The Physical Activity Loyalty scheme intervention was based on high‐street loyalty cards where participants earned points for minutes of activity (monitored via remote sensing) that could be redeemed for rewards (1 min=about £0·03), complemented by evidence‐based behaviour change techniques. The primary outcome was objectively measured mean steps per day at 6 months using a validated pedometer (Digi‐Walker CW‐701, Yamax, Japan) measured during 7 days, assessed with intention‐to‐treat analysis. Secondary outcomes used for economic analyses, nested within the study, included self‐reported health, mental wellbeing, quality of life, work absenteeism and presenteeism, and use of health‐care resources. Cost‐effectiveness, cost‐benefit, and mediation analyses were conducted. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN17975376. Findings: Between Sept 1, 2014, and Oct 31, 2015, we recruited and randomly assigned 37 clusters and 853 participants (71% female, mean age 43·6 years [SD 9·6]) to the intervention (19 clusters, 457 participants) or control group (18, 396). Primary outcome data were available for 249 (54·4%) intervention and 236 (59·6%) control participants. Mean steps per day were significantly lower in the intervention group at 6 months (adjusted mean difference −336, 95% CI −612 to −60; p=0·02). The intervention was not cost‐effective. There was a 60% probability of the intervention being cost‐saving from an employer's perspective arising from reduced absenteeism. Interpretation: Our mixed results pose challenges that are too infrequently exposed in public heath intervention trials. Our incentive level might have been too low to incentivise change, even though it was designed a priori by a contingent valuation survey. Also, major re‐structuring of several organisations presented substantial implementation challenges. Funding: National Institute for Health Research Public Health Research (PHR) Programme.

AB: This study examines whether improvements in probability and cost biases following cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety disorder endure over the long‐term. Participants (N = 65) diagnosed with social anxiety disorder were randomly assigned and completed eight sessions of either exposure group therapy or virtual reality exposure therapy delivered according to a treatment manual. 24 participants completed standardized self‐report measures of probability and cost biases at pre‐treatment, post‐treatment, and 5½ years, on average, after completing active treatment (range 2.5–6.5 years). Analyses of variance show that, relative to wait list, participants who completed an active treatment reported greater decline in probability and cost biases at post‐treatment. Further, relative to pre‐treatment, all treated participants reported significant improvements in probability and cost biases at post‐treatment and at long‐term follow‐up. Cognitive‐behavioral therapy may lead to long‐lasting reductions in cognitive biases.

AB: Objective To investigate the feasibility and reliability of virtual endoscopy (VE) as a rapid, low‐cost, and interactive tool for the diagnosis and surgical planning of suprasellar arachnoid cysts (SACs). Methods Eighteen patients with SACs treated with endoscopic ventriculocystostomy were recruited, and 18 endoscopic patients treated with third ventriculostomy were randomly selected as a VE reconstruction control group. After loading their DICOM data into free 3D Slicer software, VE reconstruction was independently performed by 3 blinded clinicians and the time required for each reconstruction was recorded. Another 3 blinded senior neurosurgeons interactively graded the visibility of VE by watching video recordings of the endoscopic procedures. Based on the visibility scores, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to investigate the reliability of VE to diagnose SACs, and Bland‐Altman plots were used to assess the reliability of VE for surgical planning. In addition, the intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated to estimate the consistency among the results of 3 reconstruction performers. Results All 3 independent reconstructing performers successfully completed VE simulation for all cases, and the average reconstruction time was 10.2 +/‐ 9.7 minutes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the cyst visibility score was 0.96, implying its diagnostic value for SACs. The Bland‐Altman plot indicated good agreement between VE and intraoperative viewings, suggesting the anatomic accuracy of the VE for surgical planning. In addition, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.81, which revealed excellent interperformer consistency of our simulation method. Conclusions This study substantiated the feasibility and reliability of VE as a rapid, low‐cost, and interactive modality for diagnosis and surgical planning of SACs. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

YR: 2017
AB: INTERVENTION: Arm 1: The intervention will last 12 months for each participant. Teleconsulting + IBDsmart. Those allocated to the teleconsulting + IBDsmart group will be treated in teleconsulting suites in Dunstan and Queenstown for the duration of the study. Their gastroenterologist will be situated at a teleconsulting unit in Dunedin Hospital. IBDsmart is a previously developed smartphone app that contains validated disease activity indices for IBD patients that can be completed by the patient on their smartphone and sent directly to their gastroenterologist and/or IBD Nurse remotely. A profile containing the patient’s details is generated by the IBD Nurse and IBDsmart is downloaded to the patient’s smartphone. Before each teleconsulting clinic, the patient will send a symptom score from the IBDsmart app on their phone to the gastroenterology unit in Dunedin and the generated report including past scores will be uploaded to Health Connect South. Crohn’s disease (CD) patients will send a Harvey‐Bradshaw Index (HBI) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients will send a Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI). The teleconsultations will occur as often as they normally would for the patient (e.g., if the patient is normally seen by their gastroenterologist every six months, each teleconsultation will happen six monthly). Each teleconsultation will be of the normal length of an outpatient appointment (i.e. 15‐30 minutes). The teleconsultations will replace normal person‐to‐person appointments and the content of them will be the same apart from the fact the doctor will not be sitting in the same room as the patient. CONDITION: Crohn's disease inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis PRIMARY OUTCOME: Disease control. Measured by clinical disease activity indices measured at each clinic visit, frequency of clinic visits, number of flare‐ups, and frequency of ‘emergency’ consultations. Disease specific quality of life. Measured using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). The IBDQ contains 32 items divided into 4 health subdimensions: bowel symptoms (e.g., loose stools, abdominal pain; 10 items), systemic symptoms (e.g., fatigue, sleeping problems; 5 items), social functioning (e.g., limited social activity, school, or work attendance; 5 items), and emotional functioning (e.g., irritability, anger, depression; 12 items). The IBDQ has a minimum clinically significant change score of 20 points. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Acceptability. Measured using custom made questionnaires prepared for the Dr and patients in the study. Cost effectivness. A cost‐effectiveness analysis comparing teleconsulting + IBDsmart to standard medical care for IBD patients in Central Otago will be conducted from a predominantly societal perspective. Direct costs will comprise service delivery costs including clinician time and travel, clinic, technology costs and additional medical costs such as hospital in‐patient care. Indirect costs will include out‐of‐pocket costs to patients such as GP visits, travel costs and time off work. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1) diagnosed with IBD, 2) aged 18 or older, 3) living rurally, and 4) able to speak English.

YR: 2013
KY: Depression; Depressive Disorder
AB: This project will test a practical intervention that uses low cost technologies to activate depressed patients' existing social networks for self‐management support. The intervention links patients with a "CarePartner" (CP), i.e., a non‐household family member or close friend who is willing to support the patient in coordination with the clinician and any existing in‐home caregiver (ICG). Through weekly automated telemonitoring, patients report their mood and self‐management status, and receive tailored guidance on self‐management. The CP receives a corresponding update along with guidance on how to best support the patient's self‐management efforts, and the primary care team is notified about clinically urgent situations. The intervention will be tested among depressed primary care patients from clinics serving low‐income and underinsured patients, whom the intervention was especially designed to benefit. Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of one year of telemonitoring‐supported CP for depression versus usual care (control) on depression severity. Specific Aim 2 is to examine key secondary outcomes (response and remission, impairment, well‐being, caregiving burden, healthcare costs) and potential moderators. Specific Aim 3 is to use a mixed‐methods approach to enrich our interpretation of the statistical associations, and to discover strategies to enhance the intervention's acceptability, effectiveness, and sustainability. If the intervention proves effective without increasing clinician burden or marginal costs, then its subsequent implementation could yield major public health benefits, especially in medically underserved populations.

AB: Importance Advances in mobile technology have resulted in federal and industry‐level initiatives to facilitate large‐scale clinical research using smart devices. Although the benefits of technology to expand data collection are obvious, assumptions about the reach of mobile research methods (access), participant willingness to engage in mobile research protocols (engagement), and the cost of this research (cost) remain untested. Objective To assess the feasibility of a fully mobile randomised controlled trial using assessments and treatments delivered entirely through mobile devices to depressed individuals. Design Using a web‐based research portal, adult participants with depression who also owned a smart device were screened, consented and randomised to 1 of 3 mental health apps for treatment. Assessments of self‐reported mood and cognitive function were conducted at baseline, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Physical and social activity was monitored daily using passively collected phone use data. All treatment and assessment tools were housed on each participant's smart phone or tablet. Interventions A cognitive training application, an application based on problem‐solving therapy, and a mobile‐sensing application promoting daily activities. Results Access: We screened 2923 people and enrolled 1098 participants in 5 months. The sample characteristics were comparable to the 2013 US census data. Recruitment via Craigslist. org yielded the largest sample. Engagement: Study engagement was high during the first 2 weeks of treatment, falling to 44% adherence by the 4th week. Cost: The total amount spent on for this project, including staff costs and beta testing, was $314 264 over 2 years. Conclusions and relevance These findings suggest that mobile randomised control trials can recruit large numbers of participants in a short period of time and with minimal cost, but study engagement remains challenging.

TI: Transdisciplinary Versus Usual Care for Type1 Diabetes in Adolescence
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03557151
YR: 2018
KY: Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1
AB: Large epidemiologic studies show that <25% of adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) achieve targeted glycohemoglobin levels advocated by the American Diabetes Association (< 7.5%) or International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (< 7.0%). Optimal self‐management of T1D requires daily insulin replacement by multiple injections or insulin pump, 4‐6 daily blood glucose checks, regulation of carbohydrate intake and physical activity, prevention/correction of glycemic fluctuations and perhaps use of a continuous glucose monitor. This regimen places pervasive affective, behavioral, cognitive and social demands on adolescents with T1D and their families and psychosocial variables greatly impact their success in T1D self‐care. Struggling with maintaining adequate glycemic control is essentially normative among adolescents, suggesting that conventional systems of care are not meeting the needs of this population. A substantial, growing literature provides an evidence base for psychosocial screening and behavioral intervention strategies targeting improved coping with the demands of T1D, but this evidence base has not penetrated fully into routine T1D care. Rigorous integration of this evidence into routine care for T1D could yield many benefits. Behavioral barriers to effective care are major concerns of all stakeholders, but conventional care is not well‐equipped to address these issues. Concomitantly, the supply of board‐certified pediatric endocrinologists is not keeping pace with growth of the T1D patient population, amplifying the need to validate alternative delivery systems that multiply the effective workforce of T1D health professionals. We will develop and test a novel Transdisciplinary Care (TC) approach (conjoint TC visits conducted by an Advanced Practice Nurse, Psychology Postdoctoral Fellow and Dietitian) to improve adolescents' T1D outcomes and justify a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT). In Year 1, crowdsourcing methods will engage youths with T1D, parents and health care providers (HCP) in planning a feasible, acceptable, safe and effective TC model that addresses youths' and families' psychosocial needs and capitalizes on the expertise of advanced practice nurses co‐managing T1D with psychologists and dietitians. The Wallander et al. stress and coping model and the D'Zurilla and Goldfried problem solving model provide a sound conceptual framework for the TC model of care. The TC team will learn each discipline's skills in T1D management, develop a detailed TC manual to guide this work and others' future studies, see adolescents and parents together as a team, screen for potentially modifiable psychological impediments to T1D care, and promote families' coping resources by enhancing family‐centered communication and problem solving, implementing empirically validated behavioral interventions and facilitating additional appropriate services for complex problems. Telehealth delivery of TC care carries several potential advantages, justifying a rigorous RCT in Years 2‐3 comparing the effects of UC and of both Face‐to‐Face and Telehealth delivery of TC on glycemic control and treatment adherence (primary outcomes) as well as quality of life and other psychosocial variables (secondary outcomes). Qualitative and economic analyses will follow the RCT, providing perspectives on mechanisms of TC effects and its sustainability. Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods will validate an innovative model of T1D care for adolescents that could then be tested in a future definitive, multi‐site RCT. We will address these specific aims: SPECIFIC AIM 1. In Year 1, with methods used effectively in our ongoing DP3 study of parents of children <6 years old with T1D, we will engage separate "crowds" of adolescents with T1D, parents, and HCPs in planning/refining a feasible, safe, acceptable and efficacious Trans‐Disciplinary care model (TC) for T1D in adolescence. This crowdsourcing effort should yield a TC model that meets the needs of all key stakeholder groups, ensuring its feasibility, acceptance and efficacy. SPECIFIC AIM 2. With study oversight by a diverse stakeholder panel and guided by a detailed intervention manual, 150 families of adolescents treated for T1D at Nemours practices in the Delaware Valley or Florida will participate in a rigorous Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in years 2 and 3. The RCT will compare Usual Care (UC) with Trans‐Disciplinary Care delivered in In‐Person clinic visits (TC‐IP) or via Telehealth (TC‐TH) on glycohemoglobin (HbA1C), treatment adherence, health care use, T1D‐related distress, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction. The proposed trial will yield substantial information that could justify a definitive future test of this model, inform methodological planning for subsequent studies, and determine if Telehealth or Face to Face delivery of TC would be more strongly justified for evaluation in future trials. SPECIFIC AIM 3. Qualitative interviews of adolescents, parents, and health care providers completed at the midpoint and end of the RCT will identify possible mediators or moderators of TC efficacy and guide refinements to the TC model. We will interview third party payers about the feasibility of dissemination of the TC model into practice and collect health care cost data. These analyses will strengthen the justification for a future, larger trial of TC, and guide refinements to the TC model to further enhance its efficacy.

AB: An evaluation was undertaken on the effectiveness and efficiency of care coordination in delivering health services to Australian veterans with chronic or complex medical conditions requiring multidisciplinary care and who had moderate to high care needs. The veterans participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) supported by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. For evaluation of the RCT, information on cost of care and quality of life (QOL) was collected before the commencement of coordinated care and at follow‐up after 12 months. Of 525 veterans who were recruited, 481 were surveyed at baseline (243 in the intervention group and 238 controls). At follow‐up, 421 were surveyed (213 intervention and 208 controls). There were no significant differences between the coordinated care and control groups of veterans in costs of care or in QOL measurements using the SF‐12 Health Survey and the EuroQol Group EQ‐5D. These findings are consistent with those reported in earlier studies which suggest that benefits from care coordination programmes may take some time to emerge.

AB: The objective of this clinical trial is to compare the effectiveness of telemedicine Cognitive‐Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for insomnia [via the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Sleep Telemedicine (AASM Sleep TM) platform] to gold standard face‐to‐face CBT for insomnia. The central hypothesis is that CBT for insomnia delivered by AASM SleepTM will be comparable to face‐to‐face CBT for insomnia for clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction, but AASM SleepTM will be a more cost effective treatment modality (primarily through reduced costs associated with facility use and patient time). The rationale for the proposed project is rooted in the critical need to disseminate CBT for insomnia using the most effective and efficient modalities, with recognition that therapist involvement likely produces the most favorable outcomes.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the (cost‐)effectiveness of online consultations in follow‐up of patients with celiac disease (CD). STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter randomized, controlled trial involving 304 patients aged ≤25 years with CD for ≥1 year, randomized to an online (n = 156) or outpatient consultation (n = 148). An online consultation included questionnaires for symptom and growth measurement. Antitransglutaminase‐type‐2 antibodies were determined using a point‐of‐care (POC) test. Controls had a traditional consultation with antitransglutaminase‐type‐2 antibodies testing in laboratories. Both groups completed questionnaires concerning CD‐specific health‐related quality of life (HRQOL), gluten‐free diet adherence, and patient satisfaction. Six months later, participants repeated HRQOL and patient satisfaction questionnaires and the POC test. The primary outcome was anti‐transglutaminase‐type‐2 antibodies after 6 months, and the secondary outcomes were health problems, dietary adherence, HRQOL, patient satisfaction, and costs. RESULTS: The performance of the POC test was inferior to laboratory testing (2/156 positive POC tests vs 13/148 positive laboratory tests; P = .003). Health problems were detected significantly more frequently using online consultation. The detection of growth problems and dietary transgressions was similar. HRQOL (from 1 [good] to 5 [poor]) improved after online consultation (from 3.25 to 3.16 [P = .013] vs controls from 3.10 to 3.23; P = .810). Patient satisfaction (from 1 [low] to 10 [high]) was 7.6 (online) vs 8.0 (controls; P = .001); 58% wished to continue online consultations. Mean costs per participant during the studied period were €202 less for the online group (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The primary outcome could not be tested because the POC test was unreliable. Nevertheless, our results indicate that online consultations for children and young adults with CD are cost saving, increase CD‐specific HRQOL, and are satisfactory for the majority.

AB: Purpose: Low‐cost interventions to improve cancer screening among primary care patients are needed. The comparative effectiveness of personalized letters, automated telephone calls, and both on breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is not known. Methods: A pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in 2011 to 2012. Eligible primary care patients were women ages 50 to 74 years who were past due for mammography and men or women who were past due for mammography or CRC screening of any kind (>12 months since last fecal occult blood test, >5 years since last sigmoidoscopy/double‐contrast barium enema, or >10 years since last colonoscopy), respectively. Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 interventions: personalized mailed letters, automated telephone calls, or both. The primary outcome was medical record documentation of a completed mammogram or CRC screening within 36 weeks of randomization. We estimated the costs of each intervention and calculated the marginal cost‐effectiveness per person screened. Results: The crude screening rates for BC were 19%, 22%, and 37% and for CRC were 17%, 14%, and 24% for the letter, automated call, and combined (letter/automated call) groups, respectively. The combined intervention group had a statistically higher screening rate (P <.05) compared with either of the single intervention groups (letter only or automated call) for both BC and CRC in both the crude and adjusted analyses. The combined intervention costs $5.11 per additional person screened for BC and $13.14 per additional person screened for CRC. Conclusion: In a primary care practice, letters plus automated telephone calls are better than either alone in increasing cancer screening rates among patients who are overdue for screening. These findings suggest the promise of a relatively inexpensive intervention to improve cancer screening.

AB: To investigate the impact of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on health‐related quality of life (HRQOL), treatment satisfaction (TS) medical resource use, and indirect costs in the SWITCH study. SWITCH was a multicentre, randomized, crossover study. Patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 153) using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) were randomized to a 12 month sensor‐On/Off or sensor‐Off/On sequence (6 months each treatment), with a 4‐month washout between periods. HRQOL in children and TS in adults were measured using validated questionnaires. Medical resource utilization data were collected. In adults, TS was significantly higher in the sensor‐On arm, and there were significant improvements in ratings for treatment convenience and flexibility. There were no clinically significant differences in children's HRQOL or parents' proxy ratings. The incidence of severe hypoglycaemia, unscheduled visits, or diabetes‐related hospitalizations did not differ significantly between the two arms. Adult patients made fewer telephone consultations during the sensor‐On arm; children's caregivers made similar numbers of telephone consultations during both arms, and calls were on average only 3 min longer during the sensor‐On arm. Regarding indirect costs, children with >70 % sensor usage missed fewer school days, compared with the sensor‐Off arm (P = 0.0046) but there was no significant difference in the adults days of work off. The addition of CGM to CSII resulted in better metabolic control without imposing an additional burden on the patient or increased medical resource use, and offered the potential for cost offsets.

What is known already: Monitoring the follicular phase is needed to adapt gonadotrophin dose, avoid OHSS and plan HCG administration. Traditionally, patients visit care providers, entailing transportation costs and productivity loss. It stresses patients, partners, care providers and the environment. Patients who live at great distance from IVF centres have more difficult access to treatment. Study design, size, duration: Non‐inferiority RCT between S and NS. Sample size calculations based on the number of metaphase‐II oocytes at retrieval showed we need 100 patients in each study arm. This also allows comparing patients reported outcomes (PRO) and health‐economic data (HE). Interim report after 10 months; time horizon =2 years. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Inclusion criteria: < 41 years, ICSI, no poor response, two ovaries. We used a PC with vaginal probe and a specific web application. Study participants were given sonographic training sessions at the centre. 58 randomized patients completed their study cycle with SOET (n = 29; 1 drop‐out) or non‐SOET(n = 29); 19/78 (20%) eligible patients declined participation for different reasons. Main results and the role of chance: Patient characteristics (age, partner age, BMI, smoking, treatment rank, AMH) in SOET‐ and non‐SOET are comparable. Clinical results: similar conception rates (S: 10/28 = 36%; NS: 14/29 = 48%) (p = 0.42) Laboratory results: similar n follicles.15mmatOPU(S: 8.2 +/‐ 3.1; NS: 8.7 +/‐ 7.7), n ova at OPU (S: 11.8 +/‐ 6.3; NS: 10.5 +/‐ 7.9), n metaphase‐II oocytes (S: 8.9 +/‐ 4.9; NS: 8.4 +/‐ 6.9), log2 n metaphase‐II oocytes (S: 3.01 +/‐ 0.887; NS: 2.72 +/‐ 1.263), n transferable embryos available at ET (S: 4.3 +/‐ 3.7; NS: 4.5 +/‐ 3.4), n excellent embryos (S: 1.4 +/‐ 0.6; NS: 1.1 +/‐ 0.7) and n embryos frozen (S: 0.8 +/‐ 1.4; NS: 1.5 +/‐ 2.2). PRO: S (n = 22) showed a significantly higher feeling of empowerment (p = 0.02) and more partner participation (p = 0.04) than NS (n = 25); comparing S patients with their own historic controls as NS (n = 15) showed higher empowerment (p < 0.001), partner participation (p = 0.004), feeling of discretion (p = 0.002), less stress (p = 0.008) and a trend towards more contentedness (p = 0.09). HE analysis: SOET cycles have 8x less productivity loss (74 +/‐ 163+/‐0 vs. 361E+/‐440 ; p < 0.01), 4‐5x lower transportation cost (49E+/‐73+/‐0 vs. 224+/‐3450; p < 0.01), > 10x direct lower sonograms and consultation costs (23+/‐280 vs. 248+/‐1490; p < 0.01), but higher personnel cost (100+/‐420 vs. 181+/‐330; p < 0.01). Limitations, reason for caution: Preliminary results are in line with noninferiority hypothesis. Mean average difference for primary outcome variable (n metaphase‐II oocytes) = ‐0.29 (95% CI: ‐0.87; 0.28). Non‐inferiority can be concluded with all these values < 0.32. Wider implications of the findings: SOETworks. Innovative approach offering advantages: empowering patients in urban western settings, increasing and facilitating access to treatment in large countries, bringing care towards patients in poor resource settings by using the concept of "flying care providers", allowing a disconnection between monitoring and laboratory facilities. Trial continues to reach full power. Hard‐ and software to be further developed. RCT preliminary data highly suggestive.

AB: INTERVENTION: The proposed intervention to be studied is initiation of HMV at home as compared to in hospital initiation I different settings. Recently a pilot study was performed in Groningen in which the initiation of HMV at home was compared with an in hospital start. We found that initiation of HMV at home in a selected group under strict supervision of a HMV center seemed effective, safe, and probably cost‐effective compared to inpatient initiation. These results need to be duplicated and extrapolated to other models of initiation in the hospital than the Groningen model. We will therefore perform a similar study, in all four existing centers for home mechanical ventilation in the Netherlands..

AB: OBJECTIVE: To monitor and control the blood glucose levels in inefficiently insulin‐treated patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) using a telemonitoring system and determine whether the improvement of HbA1c has a lasting effect following its discontinuation. DESIGN: Seventy inefficiently controlled insulin‐treated DM patients using telemonitoring (telemonitoring group‐TG) [HbA1c 9.9±2.3% (85±24.9mmol/mol)] and 35 age‐, body mass index (BMI)‐ and Hba1c‐matched insulin‐treated patients receiving outpatient care (control group‐CG) [HbA1c 9.7±2.1% (82±23.4mmol/mol)] were enrolled. Data of TG were transmitted from the glucose‐meters to our computers via modem. Communication was achieved via e‐mails and mobile phone text‐messages through integrated software. HbA1c and BMI were evaluated at enrollment, 3 and 6 months, and 6 months after telemonitoring discontinuation. Frequency of hypo‐ and hyperglycemias and cost were also analyzed. RESULTS: Significant reduction in HbA1c was observed in TG both at 3 [7.1±1.0% (54±10.5mmol/mol) p<0.001] and 6 months [6.9±0.9% (52±9.5mmol/mol) p<0.001], compared to the CG group at the same timepoints. Significant reduction was also observed in the TG subgroups with ΗbA1c≥10% and 10>HbA1c≥7.5% at 3 and 6 months, compared to CG. No statistically significant differences in BMI were observed between TG and CG. Six months after telemonitoring discontinuation, HbA1c in TG was slightly increased [7.3±1.0% (56±10.4mol/mol)]. Attenuation was also observed in both TG subgroups. Compared to CG, the number of monthly hypo‐ and hyperglycemias was reduced in TG. The intervention had a financial benefit for patients living more than 100 km from the health care provider. CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring can result in reduction of HbA1c and frequency of hypo‐ and hyperglycemias. This beneficial effect is slightly attenuated 6 months after terminating telemonitoring.

AB: Background: Home telemonitoring has developed considerably over recent years in chronic diseases in order to improve communication between healthcare professionals and patients and to promote early detection of deteriorating health status. In the nephrology setting, home telemonitoring has been evaluated in home dialysis patients but data are scarce concerning chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients before and after renal replacement therapy. The eNephro study is designed to assess the cost effectiveness, clinical/biological impact, and patient perception of a home telemonitoring for CKD patients. Our purpose is to present the rationale, design and organisational aspects of this study. Methods: eNephro is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, comparing home telemonitoring versus usual care in three populations of CKD patients: stage 3B/4 (n = 320); stage 5D CKD on dialysis (n = 260); stage 5 T CKD treated with transplantation (n= 260). Five hospitals and three not‐for‐profit providers managing self‐care dialysis situated in three administrative regions in France are participating. The trial began in December 2015, with a scheduled 12‐month inclusion period and 12 months follow‐up. Outcomes include clinical and biological data (e.g. blood pressure, haemoglobin) collected from patient records, perceived health status (e.g. health related quality of life) collected from self‐administered questionnaires, and health expenditure data retrieved from the French health insurance database (SNIIRAM) using a probabilistic matching procedure. Discussion: The hypothesis is that home telemonitoring enables better control of clinical and biological parameters as well as improved perceived health status. This better control should limit emergency consultations and hospitalisations leading to decreased healthcare expenditure, compensating for the financial investment due to the telemedicine system.

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03505138
YR: 2018
AB: The prevalence of COPD is high and suppose one of the first public health problem in the world. It has a high morbidity and mortality and healthcare costs. The economic aspect is directly related to hospitalization, accounting for 45‐50% of total expenditure of COPD. Patients with frequent exacerbations generate most of the cost. In these patients, there are not standardized treatments or monitoring in a medium or long term, but it seems reasonable that the combination of various interventions (programs self‐care, active role of health professionals in consultations, home programs, group visits, establishment action plans for patients, use of communication technologies or social networks) may improve many patient outcomes. The hypothesis of our work will be to introduce telemedicine platform to establish action plans for the patient, recognition of symptoms and exacerbations, treatments for the exacerbations, training material on COPD, smoking and inhalation therapy, establishment of a fast and fluid communication with pulmonologist, with the purpose of responding to various health problems that patients with COPD (exacerbator phenotype or ACO phenotype) may have. We will study the impact of this tool to reduce the rate income or readmission for the patients with COPD, analyzing it from the perspective of cost‐effectiveness.

AB: Aims: We aim to assess whether a purpose‐developed mobile application (app) is non‐inferior regarding effectiveness and cost‐effective when used to treat women with urinary incontinence (UI), as compared to care as usual in Dutch primary care. Additionally, we will explore the expectations and experiences of patients and care providers regarding app usage. Methods: A mixed‐methods study will be performed, combining a pragmatic, randomized‐controlled, non‐inferiority trial with an extensive process evaluation. Women aged ≥18 years, suffering from UI ≥ 2 times per week and with access to a smartphone or tablet are eligible to participate. The primary outcome will be the change in UI symptom scores at 4 months after randomization, as assessed by the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire UI Short Form. Secondary outcomes will be the change in UI symptom scores at 12 months, as well as the patient‐reported global impression of improvement, quality of life, change in sexual functioning, UI episodes per day, and costs at 4 and 12 months. In parallel, we will perform an extensive process evaluation to assess the expectations and experiences of patients and care providers regarding app usage, making use of interviews, focus group sessions, and log data analysis. Conclusion: This study will assess both the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of app‐based treatment for UI. The combination with the process evaluation, which will be performed in parallel, should also give valuable insights into the contextual factors that influence the effectiveness of such a treatment.

AB: Sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is a prevalent disease with significant morbidity resulting in long waiting lists and high health care costs. Therefore, alternative cost‐effective approaches are urgently needed. A possible procedure is telemedicine based on ICT. The design of the study is prospective, randomized, controlled, open and parallel. A ICT‐based out of hospital management of SAHS is implemented to be compared with the classical in‐hospital management. The main objectives were the evaluation of both groups and the analysis of efficacy and cost effectiveness of two SAHS management programs. This is a 3 month randomized, with parallel groups study. Participants will be patients with suspicion of SAHS derived to the Investigators' Sleep Unit. Patients are randomized in two groups; 1) classical in‐hospital group: polysomnography or home respiratory polygraphy (HRP), CPAP titration and treatment and hospital follow‐up; and 2) ICT group: 3 consecutive HRPs, automatic CPAP treatment and control by phone/video conferences and data transmission by using a custom designed platform.

AB: PURPOSE: The use of technology to implement cost‐effective health care management on a large scale may be an alternative for diabetes management but needs to be evaluated in controlled trials. This study assessed the utility and cost‐effectiveness of an automated Diabetes Remote Monitoring and Management System (DRMS) in glycemic control versus usual care. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled study, patients with uncontrolled diabetes on insulin were randomized to use of the DRMS or usual care. Participants in both groups were followed up for 6 months and had 3 clinic visits at 0, 3, and 6 months. The DRMS used text messages or phone calls to remind patients to test their blood glucose and to report results via an automated system, with no human interaction unless a patient had severely high or low blood glucose. The DRMS made adjustments to insulin dose(s) based on validated algorithms. Participants reported medication adherence through the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale‐8, and diabetes‐specific quality of life through the diabetes Daily Quality of Life questionnaire. A cost‐effectiveness analysis was conducted based on the estimated overall costs of DRMS and usual care. FINDINGS: A total of 98 patients were enrolled (59 [60%] female; mean age, 59 years); 87 participants (89%) completed follow‐up. HbA1c was similar between the DRMS and control groups at 3 months (7.60% vs 8.10%) and at 6 months (8.10% vs 7.90%). Changes from baseline to 6 months were not statistically significant for self‐reported medication adherence and diabetes‐specific quality of life, with the exception of the Daily Quality of Life‐Social/Vocational Concerns subscale score (P = 0.04). IMPLICATIONS: An automated system like the DRMS may improve glycemic control to the same degree as usual clinic care and may significantly improve the social/vocational aspects of quality of life. Cost‐effectiveness analysis found DRMS to be cost‐effective when compared to usual care and suggests DRMS has a good scale of economy for program scale up. Further research is needed to determine how to sustain the benefits seen with the automated system over longer periods.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Determine the feasibility, patient satisfaction, cost and clinical outcomes of using telehealth in Parkinson's disease (PD).BACKGROUND: PD is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that benefits from a multidisciplinary approach to comprehensive, subspecialty care as embodied in the Patient‐Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model. Telehealth is an innovative resource that can enhance care within this framework by increasing access and reducing travel‐related costs. Research suggests that these implementations lead to increased patient satisfaction, cost savings and equal or better clinical outcomes, but they have not been well‐studied in PD.DESIGN/METHODS: Randomized‐controlled trial. Video telehealth took place at a VA facility nearer to the patient (“outreach telehealth”) or in the patient's home (“home telehealth”). The control group received usual, in‐office care. Patient satisfaction, assessed at 6 and 12 month visits by quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews, was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included measures of quality of life (PDQ‐8), depression, travel cost, and clinical events (ED visits, admissions, provider phone contacts, and clinical referrals). T‐test and chi‐square analyses will examine quantitative differences between groups. Qualitative analysis of post‐telehealth patient interviews will be conducted. Data collection will conclude in January 2014.RESULTS: 86 male patients were enrolled (home telehealth:18 active, 18 control; outreach telehealth:26 active, 24 control) with a mean age of 73 (Range: 42‐87). There were no significant differences between baseline characteristics of active and controls in each arm (p>0.05). 38% of PD patients in our clinic were eligible; with 62% of these enrolling. 43 patients have completed the 12 month study, 11 died before completion and 11 withdrew.CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of studying telehealth for PD in a PCMH model has been demonstrated. As telehealth programs expand, it will be important to define their role in PD, and these findings will represent the largest study to date on this important topic.

AB: INTERVENTION: A centralised telephone‐based ‘remote access’ cancer care coordination intervention, administered by a cancer nurse. After submitting a self‐complete questionnaire at baseline (just prior to, or in the days following, surgery for colorectal cancer), participants will be randomised into the intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group will receive the nursing care coordination and support service telephone calls from the cancer nurse at 3 days, 10 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after their discharge from hospital. CONDITION: Colorectal cancer PRIMARY OUTCOME: Care coordination (as measured by a self‐complete multiple‐choice questionnaire we developed in the pilot study for this project) Quality of life (as measured by the self‐complete FACT‐C questionnaire). SECONDARY OUTCOME: Cost effectiveness of the telephone intervention. A cost consequence analysis will be conducted whereby the net difference in costs associated with the intervention and health service utilisation between the intervention and control groups will be compared to the net difference in the primary outcome measures. The cost data will be collected via self completed questionnaires about health service utilisation (and other outcomes described above). Health service utilisation (as measured by a self‐complete questionnaire about frequency of visits to a range of health professionals including the surgeon, general practitioner, oncologist, radiologist. Also measured by determining number of attendances at GP, hospital admissions, and emergency department attendances from medical records). Satisfaction with health services (as measured by the self‐complete FACIT‐TS‐PS questionnaire).

AB: BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are highly prevalent in the working population and are associated with excessive costs for both society and companies. Effective treatment for employees with depressive symptoms in occupational health care is limited. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of an indicated preventive web‐based guided self‐help course for employees with depressive symptoms. METHODS: The study is a two‐arm randomized controlled trial comparing a web‐based guided self‐help course with care‐as‐usual. The self‐help course consists of 6 weekly lessons. Weekly support will be provided by a coach via the website. Subjects in the care‐as‐usual group do not receive any treatment in addition to regular care. 200 white collar workers from several national and international companies in the Netherlands will be recruited via different methods such as banners on the company's intranet, pamphlets and posters. Subjects will be included when they: have elevated depressive symptoms (score ≥16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), are 18 years of age or older, have access to the Internet and can be contacted via e‐mail. Exclusion criteria are: partial or full work absenteeism, a legal labor dispute with the employer and receiving treatment from the company's occupational health care at study entrance.The primary outcome is depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes include work absenteeism, work performance, burnout, anxiety, quality of life, health care use and production losses. Outcome data will be collected at 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after baseline. Analyses will be based on the intention‐to‐treat principle. The cost‐effectiveness analyses will be performed from a societal and a company's perspective. A process evaluation will be conducted alongside the study. DISCUSSION: This study evaluates the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of a web‐based guided self‐help course for employees with depressive symptoms. This study could stimulate the use of e‐mental health interventions in the worksite setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Nederlands Trial Register (NTR): TC2993.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To monitor and control the blood glucose levels in inefficiently insulin‐treated patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) using a telemonitoring system and determine whether the improvement of HbA1c has a lasting effect following its discontinuation. DESIGN: Seventy inefficiently controlled insulin‐treated DM patients using telemonitoring (telemonitoring group‐TG) [HbA1c 9.9+/‐2.3% (85+/‐24.9mmol/mol)] and 35 age‐, body mass index (BMI)‐ and Hba1c‐matched insulin‐treated patients receiving outpatient care (control group‐CG) [HbA1c 9.7+/‐2.1% (82+/‐23.4mmol/mol)] were enrolled. Data of TG were transmitted from the glucose‐meters to our computers via modem. Communication was achieved via e‐mails and mobile phone text‐messages through integrated software. HbA1c and BMI were evaluated at enrollment, 3 and 6 months, and 6 months after telemonitoring discontinuation. Frequency of hypo‐ and hyperglycemias and cost were also analyzed. RESULTS: Significant reduction in HbA1c was observed in TG both at 3 [7.1+/‐1.0% (54+/‐10.5mmol/mol) p<0.001] and 6 months [6.9+/‐0.9% (52+/‐9.5mmol/mol) p<0.001], compared to the CG group at the same timepoints. Significant reduction was also observed in the TG subgroups with HbA1c>10% and 10>HbA1c>7.5% at 3 and 6 months, compared to CG. No statistically significant differences in BMI were observed between TG and CG. Six months after telemonitoring discontinuation, HbA1c in TG was slightly increased [7.3+/‐1.0% (56+/‐10.4mol/mol)]. Attenuation was also observed in both TG subgroups. Compared to CG, the number of monthly hypo‐ and hyperglycemias was reduced in TG. The intervention had a financial benefit for patients living more than 100 km from the health care provider. CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring can result in reduction of HbA1c and frequency of hypo‐ and hyperglycemias. This beneficial effect is slightly attenuated 6 months after terminating telemonitoring.

AB: Background: Excessive use of alcohol is associated with poor sexual health, but the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of brief alcohol intervention in this setting has not been investigated. Objective: To examine the effects and cost‐effectiveness of brief intervention for excessive alcohol consumption among people who attend sexual health clinics. Design: A two‐arm, parallel‐group, single‐blind, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomised via an independent and remote telephone randomisation service using permuted blocks, stratified by clinic. Setting: Study participants were recruited from three sexual health clinics in central and west London. Participants: For inclusion, potential participants had to be aged >19 years, drink excessive alcohol according to the Modified‐Single Alcohol Screening Question, and be willing to provide written informed consent. We excluded those who were unable to communicate in English sufficiently well to complete the baseline assessment and those who could not provide contact details for the follow‐up assessment. Interventions: Brief advice was delivered by the treating clinician and comprised feedback on the possible health consequences of excessive drinking, a discussion of whether the participant's clinic attendance was linked to current alcohol use, written information on alcohol and health and an offer of an appointment with an alcohol health worker (AHW). Appointments with AHWs took place either in person or by telephone, lasted up to 30 minutes, and used the 'FRAMES' (Feedback about the adverse effects of alcohol, an emphasis on personal Responsibility for changing drinking behaviour, Advice about alcohol consumption, a Menu of options for further help and advice, an Empathic stance towards the patient and an emphasis on Self‐efficacy) approach. Those in the control arm of the trial were offered a copy of a leaflet providing general information on health and lifestyle. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were assessed 6 months after randomisation. The primary outcome was mean weekly alcohol consumption during the previous 90 days. The main secondary outcome was unprotected sex during this period. Results: Eight hundred and two people were recruited to the study of whom 592 (74%) were followed up 6 months later. Among 402 participants who were randomised to brief intervention, 397 (99%) received brief advice from the treating clinician and 81 (20%) also received input from an AHW. The adjusted mean difference in alcohol consumption after 6 months was ‐2.33 units per week [95% confidence interval (CI) ‐4.69 to 0.03 units per week, p = 0.053] for those in the active arm compared with the control arm. Unprotected sex was reported by 154 (53%) of those who received brief intervention and by 178 (59%) of controls (adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25, p = 0.496). Participants randomised to brief intervention reported drinking a mean of 10.4 units of alcohol per drinking day compared with 9.3 units among control participants (difference 1.10, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.96, p = 0.009). We found no statistically significant differences in other outcomes. Brief intervention (brief advice and input from an AHW) cost on average 12.60 per person to deliver and did not appear to provide a cost‐effective use of resources. Conclusions: Introduction of universal screening and brief intervention for excessive alcohol use among people who attend sexual health clinics does not result in clinically important reductions in alcohol consumption or provide a cost‐effective use of resources. While people attending sexual health clinics may want to achieve better sexual health, attempts to reduce alcohol consumption may not be seen by them as a necessary means of trying to achieve this aim.

AB: Background: Clinical diagnostic sensitivity alone is inadequate in the diagnosis of influenza. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is sensitive but the inherent delays in result availability potentially prolong time to isolation and treatment. Until recently no near‐patient test (NPT) has demonstrated adequate sensitivity for routine clinical use. Aim: To evaluate diagnostic accuracy, time to result availability, clinical impact, and cost consequences of AlereTM i Influenza A&B NPT (Alere Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) using off‐label throat swabs. Methods: Prospective, multi‐centre [four UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals], diagnostic accuracy cohort study with cost modelling. Throat swab samples from suspected influenza patients were tested for influenza using the reference standard of PCR; a second throat swab was tested using NPT. Findings: A total of 827 participants were recruited; 589 were suitable for analysis: sensitivity was 75.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 67.0‐84.6]; specificity was 96.8% (95% CI: 95.2‐98.3). Sensitivity varied between Sheffield (Northern General Hospital: 82.1%; Royal Hallamshire Hospital: 83.3%) and other sites (Doncaster Royal Infirmary: 71.4%; Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary: 50.0%) whereas specificity was high (92‐100%). Positive predictive value (PPV) was 81.2% (95% CI: 72.9‐89.5) with negative predictive value 95.6% (95% CI: 93.9‐97.4) with observed prevalence of 15.4%. Median time to result for PCR was 1.1 days (on‐site laboratories) and 5.2 days (remote laboratories). Isolation findings: 75% influenza positive not isolated; 69% of isolated participants did not have influenza. For a cohort of 1000 participants, annual estimated non‐diagnostic cost savings with NPT are 215,040. Conclusion: This first prospective study of the Alere i NPT using throat swabs demonstrates high specificity, high PPV during seasonal epidemics, and rapid result availability which could lead to substantial cost savings.

AB: Objective: To determine the 12‐month cost‐effectiveness of a collaborative care (CC) program for treating depression following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery versus physicians' usual care (UC). Methods: We obtained 12 continuous months of Medicare and private medical insurance claims data on 189 patients who screened positive for depression following CABG surgery, met criteria for depression when reassessed by telephone 2 weeks following hospitalization (nine‐item Patient Health Questionnaire ≥ 10) and were randomized to either an 8‐month centralized, nurse‐provided and telephone‐delivered CC intervention for depression or to their physicians' UC. Results: At 12 months following randomization, CC patients had of sensitivity analyses produced no significant changes. The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio of CC was ‐$9889 (‐$11,940 to ‐$7838) per additional quality‐adjusted life‐year (QALY), and there was 90% probability it would be cost‐effective at the willingness to pay threshold of $20,000 per additional QALY. A bootstrapped cost‐effectiveness plane also demonstrated a 68% probability of CC "dominating" UC (more QALYs at lower cost). Conclusions: Centralized, nurse‐provided and telephone‐delivered CC for post‐CABG depression is a quality‐improving and cost‐effective treatment that meets generally accepted criteria for high‐value care.

AB: BACKGROUND: Postnatal depression (PND) can be experienced by 13% of women who give birth, and such women often exhibit disabling symptoms, which can have a negative effect on the mother and infant relationship, with significant consequences in terms of the child's later capacity for affect regulation. Research has shown that providing support to mothers experiencing PND can help reduce their depressive symptoms and improve their coping strategies. The Mums4Mums study aims to evaluate the impact of telephone peer‐support for women experiencing PND. METHODS/DESIGN: The study design adopts the MRC framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. Health visitors in Warwickshire and Coventry Primary Care Trusts are screening potential participants at the 8‐week postnatal check using either the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS > = 10) or the three Whooley questions recommended by NICE (http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG45). The Mums4Mums telephone support intervention is being delivered by trained peer‐supporters over a period of four months. The primary outcome is depressive symptomatology as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes include mother‐child interaction, dyadic adjustment, parenting sense of competence scale, and self‐efficacy. Maternal perceptions of the telephone peer‐support are being assessed using semi‐structured interviews following the completion of the intervention. DISCUSSION: The proposed study will develop current innovative work in peer‐led support interventions and telecare by applying existing expertise to a new domain (i.e. PND), testing the feasibility of a peer‐led telephone intervention for mothers living with PND, and developing the relationship between the lay and clinical communities. The intervention will potentially benefit a significant number of patients and support a future application for a larger study to undertake a full evaluation of the clinical and cost effectiveness of telephone based peer‐support for PND. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN: ISRCTN91450073. The study has received a major funding grant from National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (UK) ‐ Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB) programme (ref: PB‐PG‐0407‐13232).

AB: Depression is a common and significant health problem among older adults. Unfortunately, while effective psychological treatments exist, few older adults access treatment. The aim of the present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to examine the efficacy, long‐term outcomes, and cost‐effectiveness of a therapist‐guided internet‐delivered cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) intervention for Australian adults over 60 years of age with symptoms of depression. Participants were randomly allocated to either a treatment group (n=29) or a delayed‐treatment waitlist control group (n=25). Twenty‐seven treatment group participants started the iCBT treatment and 70% completed the treatment within the 8‐week course, with 85% of participants providing data at posttreatment. Treatment comprised an online 5‐lesson iCBT course with brief weekly contact with a clinical psychologist, delivered over 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 Item (PHQ‐9), a measure of symptoms and severity of depression. Significantly lower scores on the PHQ‐9 (Cohen's d=2.08; 95% CI: 1.38 ‐ 2.72) and on a measure of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7 Item) (Cohen's d=1.22; 95% CI: 0.61 ‐ 1.79) were observed in the treatment group compared to the control group at posttreatment. The treatment group maintained these lower scores at the 3‐month and 12‐month follow‐up time points and the iCBT treatment was rated as acceptable by participants. The treatment group had slightly higher Quality‐Adjusted Life‐Years (QALYs) than the control group at posttreatment (estimate: 0.012; 95% CI: 0.004 to 0.020) and, while being a higher cost (estimate $52.9l 95% CI: ‐23.8 to 128.2), the intervention was cost‐effective according to commonly used willingness‐to‐pay thresholds in Australia. The results support the potential efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of therapist‐guided iCBT as a treatment for older adults with symptoms of depression.

We believe that video conferencing has equivalent quality, connectivity, and ease of operation, can be done economically, and will improve evaluation. Methods Prospective randomized pilot study was used to examine video versus cellular communication between the medical command officer (MCO) and pediatric transport team (TT) for children with moderate to severe illness undergoing interhospital transport. Twenty‐five patients were randomized to cellular communication, and 25 patients were randomized to video. The MCO completed a Likert scale to evaluate connection, quality, and ease of operation. Call durations were recorded. A Likert scale to evaluate the communication mode on patient care was completed. Results Connection and audio quality were equivalent and there were no dropped calls. Average call duration in the phone group was 186 versus 139 seconds in the video group (P = 0.055). The MCO survey results were the following: 100% found video intuitive, 92% felt that disposition based on phone report was difficult, 80% felt that video provided better understanding of patient condition, 70% felt that video assisted disposition, and 80% believe that video should be used for transport. The iPad system offers a significant savings when compared with conventional telemedicine. Conclusions Video conferencing seems as easy to complete as phone with equivalent quality and connectivity. Duration of video was equivalent to phone conferencing. Surveyed MCOs believed that video conferencing improved assessment and disposition. The iPad‐based conferencing provided significant savings when compared with conventional cart‐based or robotic units. Further evaluation of video conferencing during interhospital transport is warranted.

TI: Efficacy of Telemonitoring on CPAP Treatment Compliance in Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Patients

AB: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is defined by the presence of repetitive episodes of upper airways collapse during sleep, leading to nocturnal hypoxemia, sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness. When untreated, OSA is a risk factor for arterial hypertension , cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, road accidents and a worse quality of life. The application of a continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) represents the first line therapy in patients with moderate to severe OSA. CPAP treatment improves daytime sleepiness and oxygen saturation , reduces cardiovascular risk, ameliorates neurobehavioral performance, improves quality of life and reduces road accidents. Despite its demonstrated efficacy, CPAP effectiveness is significantly limited by poor adherence. A closer follow up could improve CPAP adherence but it would take up more work and additional costs for sleep units. So on that account, the investigators propose a study to demonstrate that automatic home treatment monitoring of patients with OSA is a cost‐effectiveness alternative approach to patient's management. Moreover, the investigators believe that telemonitoring could improve CPAP compliance and patient's satisfaction and reduce follow‐up costs. Methods: Prospective and randomized study during three months. Patients diagnosed as OSA in St. Maria's Hospital (Sleep Unit) and requiring CPAP treatment, will be randomized into two groups differing in CPAP compliance monitoring and management . Group 1 Standard care Patients will be fitted with a mask and given a CPAP and instructed on how to use the device. Patients will follow the standard treatment management. All patients will be visited at 1 month at sleep unit. Patients will be checked about progress and adherence to therapy and any problems with their machine. Information will be downloaded from their machines (CPAP adherence, applied CPAP pressure, mask leak, and residual respiratory events…). Group 2 Telemonitoring Patients will be fitted with a mask and given a CPAP. Each CPAP device will be provided with a modem sending daily compliance information (CPAP adherence, CPAP pressure, mask leak, and residual respiratory events) to a web database. Patients of both 2 groups will be finally visited at 3 months at sleep unit.

AB: Background: Patients with musculoskeletal problems referred by GPs for physiotherapy often experience long delays before treatment. Some physiotherapy services have introduced a treatment pathway called PhysioDirect, involving initial telephone assessment and advice, with written self‐management and exercise advice sent by post. Patients are invited for face‐to‐face treatment only when necessary. Our hypothesis was that PhysioDirect would be equally clinically effective compared with usual care, but more cost‐effective, with increased patient satisfaction and shorter waits for treatment. Methods: Multi‐centre pragmatic individually randomized trial comparing PhysioDirect versus usual care (patients join a waiting list and receive face‐to‐face care). PhysioDirect services were established in four PCTs. Adults with musculoskeletal problems, either self‐referred for physiotherapy or referred from primary care, were invited to participate and randomized (by remote web‐based allocation) to PhysioDirect or usual care. Outcome data were collected at baseline, 6 weeks and 6 months after randomization. Outcomes were collected by patient self‐report and from medical records, blind to treatment allocation. The primary clinical outcome was SF36 PCS at 6 months; secondary outcomes included MYMOP, EQ5D, patient satisfaction, waiting times, time lost from work. Incremental cost‐effectiveness was assessed using cost per QALY. Results: 2256 patients were recruited and randomized (1513 PhysioDirect, 743 Usual Care). 1921 (85%) were followed up at 6 months. PhysioDirect and usual care were equally clinically effective on our primary outcome (difference in mean PCS ‐0.01, 95% CI ‐0.80 to 0.79) and using the MYMOP measure (‐0.02, 95% CI ‐0.16 to 0.11). Time to first assessment was 7 days for PhysioDirect compared to 34 days for Usual Care. Overall satisfaction appeared to be very slightly higher amongst those offered usual care (3.8% which equates to 0.19 points on a 6 point scale) which may not be meaningful. NHS costs were similar in the two arms (PhysioDirect £196.43 versus usual care £189.19, difference in means £19.30 (‐£37.60 to £76.19)) while QALYs gained were also similar (difference in means 0.007 (‐0.003 to 0.016)). Patients in PhysioDirect had a small but earlier improvement in health status than those in the Usual Care, achieved at an insignificantly greater cost. Incremental cost per QALY gained was £2889. Conclusions: A system of physiotherapy based on initial telephone and advice, offering face‐to‐face care only when necessary is equally clinically effective and broadly acceptable to patients compared with usual care. Although mean physiotherapy and total NHS costs were somewhat greater in PhysioDirect there was a gain in QALY compared to Usual Care due to more rapid improvement in patient outcomes.

AB: Background and Aims: Conventional follow‐up of teenagers with inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] is done during scheduled outpatient visits regardless of how well the patient feels. We designed a telemonitoring strategy for early recognition of flares and compared its efficacy with conventional follow‐up. Methods: We used a multicentre randomized trial in patients aged 10‐19 years with IBD in clinical remission at baseline. Participants assigned to telemonitoring received automated alerts to complete a symptom score and send a stool sample for measurement of calprotectin. This resulted in an individual prediction for flare with associated treatment advice and test interval. In conventional follow‐up the health check interval was left to the physician's discretion. The primary endpoint was cumulative incidence of disease flares. Secondary endpoints were percentage of participants with a positive change in quality‐of‐life and cost‐effectiveness of the intervention. Results: We included 170 participants [84 telemonitoring; 86 conventional follow‐up]. At 52 weeks the mean number of face‐to‐face visits was significantly lower in the telemonitoring group compared to conventional follow‐up [3.6 vs 4.3, p < 0.001]. The incidence of flares [33 vs 34%, p = 0.93] and the proportion of participants reporting positive change in quality‐of‐life [54 vs 44%, p = 0.27] were similar. Mean annual cost‐saving was 89 and increased to 360 in those compliant to the protocol. Conclusions: Telemonitoring is as safe as conventional follow‐up, and reduces outpatient visits and societal costs. The positive impact on quality‐of‐life was similar in the two groups. This strategy is attractive for teenagers and families, and health professionals may be interested in using it to keep teenagers who are well out of hospital and ease pressure on overstretched outpatient services.

AB: Rationale: COPD exacerbations considerably affect patients' health status and contribute to COPD related costs. Patients often have problems in recognizing and responding promptly to exacerbations. Tools that support patients in exacerbation self‐management such as paper exacerbation action plans and telemonitoring systems have shown some positive results on exacerbation related outcomes. However, many patients appear not to adhere to their action plan instructions. Besides, existing telemonitoring tools rely heavily on the input of healthcare professionals which makes it difficult to assess the true effects and cost effectiveness of telemonitoring systems. Recently, the Radboud University has developed the "Adaptive Computerized COPD Exacerbation Self‐management Support" (ACCESS) system. This software application integrates objective parameters, such as spirometry, pulse‐oximetry, temperature, and self‐reported symptom worsening into a Bayesian network model resulting in a weighted exacerbation risk prediction. Patients are able to monitor themselves at any given moment. The ACCESS system not only predicts whether an exacerbation is imminent, but also provides ad hoc tailored advice without interference of a healthcare professional. Objective: In this project the primary aim is to assess the (cost‐)effectiveness of the ACCESS system in the support of exacerbation self‐management in patients with COPD. Study design: A multicenter, pragmatic, two‐arm, randomized controlled trial with a follow‐up of 12 months per participant. Study population: Patients with COPD, > 40 years old, with 2 or more self‐reported symptom based exacerbations in the previous year. Intervention: After a short self‐management educational session on exacerbations, participants are randomized to either 1) exacerbation self‐management support through the use of a paper exacerbation action plan (control group); or 2) exacerbation self‐management support through the use of the ACCESS system (intervention group). Participants in the intervention group are instructed to use ACCESS when they notice a change in COPD symptoms. Participants in the control group are instructed to use their paper action plan when they notice a change in COPD symptoms. Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary aim: to increase the number of exacerbation‐free weeks. Secondary aims: to improve exacerbation self‐management, exacerbation‐management related self‐efficacy, and quality of life. To decrease ER visits, hospital admissions and COPD related costs.

AB: BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) remains a common cause of disability, death and hospital admission. Several investigations support the usefulness of programs of disease management for improving clinical outcomes. However, the effect of home‐based telemanagement programs on the rate of hospital readmission is still unclear and the cost‐effectiveness ratio of such programs is unknown. The aim of the study was to determine whether a home‐based telemanagement (HBT) programme in CHF patients decreased hospital readmissions and hospital costs in comparison with the usual care (UC) follow‐up programme over a one‐year period. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four hundred‐sixty CHF patients (pts), aged 57+/‐10 years were randomised to two management strategies: 230 pts to HBT programme and 230 pts to UC programme. The HBT pts received a portable device, transferring, by telephone, a one‐lead trace to a receiving station where a nurse was available for interactive teleconsultation. The UC pts were referred to their primary care physicians and cardiologists. The primary objective of the study was one‐year hospital readmission for cardiovascular reasons. During one‐year follow‐up 55 pts (24%) in HBT group and 83 pts (36%) in UC group had at least one readmission (RR=0.56; 95% CI: 0.38‐0.82; p=0.01). After adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics, the HBT group had a significantly lower risk of readmission compared with the UC group (HR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.34‐0.73; p=0.01). The intervention was associated with a 36% decrease in the total number of hospital readmissions (HBT group: 91 readmissions; UC group: 142 readmissions) and a 31% decrease in the total number of episodes of hemodynamic instability (101 in HBT group vs 147 in UC group). The rate of hearth failure‐related readmission was 19% (43 pts) in HBT group and 32% (73 pts) in UC group (RR=0.49, 95% [CI]: 0.31‐0.76; p=0.0001). No significant difference was found on cardiovascular mortality between groups. Mean cost for hospital readmission was significantly lower in HBT group (euro 843+/‐1733) than in UC group (euro 1298+/‐2322), (‐35%, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that one‐year HBT programme reduce hospital readmissions and costs in CHF patients.

AB: Learning Objectives: Despite the current and projected gaps in Intensivist staffing and the demonstrated clinical benefits of tele‐ICU, this solution has not been widely adopted. Barriers to adoption include clinical resistance, applicability to outcomes, high capital costs, and unknown return on investment (ROI). Financial evaluations of tele‐ICU have are built on clinical efficiency and its impact on length of stay (LOS). Thorough financial assessments are challenging since they rely on a health system's unique financial and clinical outcomes. Methods: A multi‐center, retrospective observational financial evaluation compared 1 year pre tele‐ICU (n=6,217) to 2 years post tele‐ICU (n=13,664) in the Carolinas HealthCare System (CHS) Critical Care Network. At CHS, tele‐ICU monitors 269 beds across 11 facilities comprised of small community hospitals, large hospitals, and an academic medical center all with varying levels of Intensivist coverage. Results: Comparing pre and post periods, we observed an average per ICU encounter decrease in variable cost of 1.8% ($8,269 to $8,121) and an increase in adjusted net revenue of 6.6% ($15,352 to $16,368), equating to an increase in the average contribution margin per ICU encounter of 16.4% ($7,082 to $8,247). Per encounter financial gains are accompanied by an ICU encounter increase of 5.6% per year and risk‐adjusted ICU LOS reduction from 2.9 to 2.4 days. The key driver to the increase in margin was DRG mix changes, offset by decreasing ICU LOS. Given these observed financial gains, projections for a prospective 12‐bed ICU with 1,000 ICU admissions per year include a 2‐year cumulative contribution margin gain of $2.09 million. This gain offsets the initial setup ($474,600) and ongoing per encounter fees over 2 years ($1.4 million) to generate an 11.4% ROI. Conclusions: We demonstrate that tele‐ICU can have a positive impact on hospital financials measured through variable costs and adjusted net revenue per ICU encounter, but maintaining a positive ROI assumes increased ICU volumes, and increased per ICU encounter revenue while maintaining stable or decreasing cost of care.

AB: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is the third most prevalent cardiovascular disease worldwide and has become a serious public health issue, with over 200 million people affected. Smoking and diabetes are the strongest risk factors for the development of peripheral artery disease, but also high cholesterol, high blood pressure and sedentary lifestyle. The most prominent symptom is leg pain while walking known as intermittent claudication, as the muscles do not get enough blood during exercise to meet the needs. To improve mobility, first line treatment for intermittent claudication are outpatient supervised exercise programs (SEPs); however, their implementation face manifold challenges: low patient adherence, no reimbursement by insurers, high costs of course implementation, and low course availability. These barriers led to the development of home‐based exercise programs, which are similarly effective when combined with a structured approach by setting exercise goals, monitoring exercise activity, and regular follow up with a coach. Therefore, this trial aims to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost advantage of TeGeCoach, a 12‐month long structured home‐based exercise program (HEP), compared with usual care of intermittent claudication. It is hypothesized that TeGeCoach will improve walking impairment and will lower the need of health care resources that are spent on patients with PAD at 24‐month follow‐up. The investigators will conduct a prospective, open‐label, multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TeGeCoach. 4630 patients with peripheral artery disease at Fontaine stage II will be randomly assigned either to TeGeCoach or Treatment‐as‐Usual (usual care). TeGeCoach consists of telephone‐based health coaching, remote walking exercise monitoring based on wearable activity monitors, and intensified primary care. The health coaching is a patient‐centered approach based on motivational interviewing, shared decision‐making and active listening techniques for supporting better patient engagement and activation, disease self‐care, treatment adherence and lifestyle management. Depending on the individual functional status and exercise capacity, participants will be asked to walk up to seven times a week. Primary outcomes are functional capacity measured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), alongside with total health care costs based upon routine health insurance data. Secondary outcome measures include quality of life, health literacy and health behavior. Outcomes will be measured at three time points (0, 12, and 24 months). Clearly, the current routine care of intermittent claudication in patients with PAD is partly ineffective und insufficient, with the consequence of a poorly served patient population and worsening disease condition. TeGeCoach may provide an effective and feasible alternative in the management of intermittent claudication by improving access to supervised exercise while at the same time potentially reducing health care costs.

AB: BACKGROUND: Art Therapy has been promoted as a means of helping people who may find it difficult to express themselves verbally engage in psychological treatment. Group Art Therapy has been widely used as an adjunctive treatment for people with schizophrenia but there have been few attempts to examine its effects and cost effectiveness has not been examined. The MATISSE study aims to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of group Art Therapy for people with schizophrenia. METHOD/DESIGN: The MATISSE study is a three‐arm, parallel group, pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial of referral to group Art Therapy plus standard care, referral to an attention control 'activity' group plus standard care, or standard care alone. Study participants were recruited from inpatient and community‐based mental health and social care services at four centres in England and Northern Ireland. Participants were aged over 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia, confirmed by an examination of case notes using operationalised criteria. Participants were then randomised via an independent and remote telephone randomisation service using permuted stacked blocks, stratified by site. Art Therapy and activity groups were made available to participants once a week for up to 12 months. Outcome measures were assessed by researchers masked to allocation status at 12 and 24 months after randomisation. Participants and care givers were aware which arm of the trial participants were allocated to. The primary outcomes for the study are global functioning (measured using the Global Assessment of Functioning scale) and mental health symptoms (measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) assessed at 24 months. Secondary outcomes were assessed at 12 and 24 months and comprise levels of group attendance, social function, satisfaction with care, mental wellbeing, and costs. DISCUSSION: We believe that this is the first large scale pragmatic trial of Art Therapy for people with schizophrenia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN46150447.

AB: Introduction The primary objective of this project was to examine the effectiveness of an Internet‐based smoking cessation intervention combined with a tele‐health medication clinic for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) compared to referral to clinic‐based smoking cessation care. Methods A total of 413 patients were proactively recruited from the Durham VA Medical Center and followed for 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive either a referral to VA specialty smoking cessation care (control) or to the Internet intervention and tele‐health medication clinic. Primary outcomes included (1) intervention reach, (2) self‐reported 7‐day point prevalence abstinence rates at 3 months and 12 months, and 3) relative cost‐effectiveness. Results Reach of the Internet intervention and use of smoking cessation aids were significantly greater compared to the control. At 3 months‐post randomization, however, there were no significant differences in quit rates: 17% (95% CI: 12%‐23%) in the Internet‐based intervention compared to 12% (95% CI: 8%‐17%) in the control arm. Similarly, there were no differences in quit rates at 12 months (13% vs. 16%). While costs associated with the Internet arm were higher due to increased penetration and intensity of NRT use, there were no statistically significant differences in the relative cost effectiveness (e.g., life years gained, quality adjusted life years) between the two arms. Conclusions Current results suggest that using an electronic medical record to identify smokers and proactively offering smoking cessation services that are consistent with US Public Health Guidelines can significantly reduce smoking in veterans. Novel interventions that increase the reach of intensive treatment are needed to maximize quit rates in this population.

AB: AIMS: Heart failure chiefly affects the elderly, with frequent emergency admissions. Telemonitoring can identify worsening heart failure but previous randomized trials have enrolled selected patient populations. The Home‐HF study examined the impact of home telemonitoring on typical heart failure patients discharged from three acute hospitals in North West London, UK. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients hospitalized with heart failure were randomized to telemonitoring or usual specialist care. Primary outcome measures were days alive and out of hospital. Secondary outcome measures were number and duration of heart failure hospitalizations, clinic visits, and quality of life. We recruited 182 patients. There was no difference in the primary outcome measure in the two groups, but there were significantly fewer unplanned hospitalizations for heart failure decompensation, and a reduction in clinic and emergency room visits in the telemonitoring group. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean direct health service costs. CONCLUSION: Home telemonitoring in a typical elderly population of heart failure patients produces a similar outcome to 'usual' specialist care, but reduces clinic and emergency room visits and unplanned heart failure rehospitalizations at little additional cost. This method of disease monitoring may allow specialist services to increase the number of patients under their care.

TI: Aligning Resources to Care for Homeless Veterans
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct01550757
YR: 2012
AB: Background: Primary care, and specifically primary care directed to homeless Veterans represents an opportunity to engage individuals in care, address unmet health needs and facilitate receipt of services necessary to exit homelessness. However, it is unclear what the best and most cost‐efficient approach is to providing this care. Past research suggests two alternative approaches to organizing and delivering primary care to homeless Veterans: (1) structurally realigned and organized care and (2) embedded peer mentoring. The overall purpose of our research is to compare and contrast outcomes from 4 different adaptations and combinations of primary care delivery to homeless Veterans within the construct of the Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) model for primary care. Objectives: 1. To test whether a peer mentor intervention embedded in the Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) model will be more effective than usual‐care PACT or, in a separate randomized controlled trial, within a homeless‐oriented PACT (H‐PACT) model, in reducing emergency department use and hospitalizations, improving chronic disease management, and increasing participation in homeless programming. 2. To compare clinical outcomes, service use, treatment engagement, self‐efficacy, and patient satisfaction of participants in usual care‐PACT with and without peer mentoring to H‐PACT with and without peer mentoring. 3. To determine differential costs and cost offsets associated with each PACT model adaptation in relation to care outcomes for homeless Veterans. 4. To determine whether a structurally adapted health care delivery model for homeless Veterans (homeless PACT) affects treatment engagement, as measured by utilization of services over time, compared with assignment to a general population Patient Aligned Care Team or no primary care assignment. Methods: Substudy #1‐ Two multi‐center Randomized Controlled Trials: The first comparing PACT to PACT+Peer Support (PACT+P); and the second comparing Homeless‐oriented PACT (H‐PACT) to H‐PACT+Peer Support (H‐PACT+P). Within each site we will conduct a 1:1 RCT of embedded peer support. Substudy #2‐ A qualitative study using focus groups of study participants from each of the intervention arms to assess perceptions of care, treatment engagement, and satisfaction within each approach. These findings will be triangulated with survey data and conditional logistic regression modeling to address the question of how each model is perceived by those receiving care within it and what outcomes can be ascribed to each care approach. This submission will occur at the end of Year 2 of the project and be specific for the focus group activities. Substudy #3‐ Cost‐Utilization Analysis Study: We will conduct a cost‐utilization analysis assessing cost offsets using CPRS, DSS, and PCMM labor mapping data to develop cost models for each care approach. Substudy #4‐ VINCI Data Extraction & Natural Language Processing: Use VINCI to analyze for PACT and H‐PACT emergency department visits, including diagnosis, whether substance abuse was a factor, whether it resulted in a hospital admission, and what type of aftercare occurred (primary care follow‐up, case manager telephone call note, etc.); hospital admissions (diagnosis, length of stay, and aftercare follow‐up), ambulatory care utilization (primary care, mental health, specialty clinics, outpatient substance abuse treatment, and homeless programming ‐ VRRC), including both face‐to‐face and remote‐based care (My HealtheVet, telehealth, telephone notes), medication compliance with continuous prescriptions (i.e. insulin, antihypertensives), and chronic disease monitoring and management (blood pressure, diabetes care, hyperlipidemia in heart disease and diabetic patients). Baseline utilization (prior 6 months) of emergency department, inpatient and primary care prior to cohort tracking will be conducted to allow for post‐hoc stratification of patient subgroups based on predicted risk for high use patterning.

AB: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease is the single leading cause of death in the United States, and medications can significantly reduce the rate of repeat cardiovascular events and treatment procedures. Adherence to these medications, however, is very low. METHODS: HeartStrong is a national randomized trial offering 3 innovations. First, the intervention is built on concepts from behavioral economics that we expect to enhance its effectiveness. Second, the implementation of the trial takes advantage of new technology, including wireless pill bottles and remote feedback, to substantially automate procedures. Third, the trial's design includes an enhancement of the standard randomized clinical trial that allows rapid‐cycle innovation and ongoing program enhancement. RESULTS: Using a system involving direct data feeds from 6 insurance partners followed by mail, telephone, and email contact, we enrolled 1,509 patients discharged from the hospital with acute myocardial infarction in a 2:1 ratio of intervention:usual care. The intervention period lasts 1 year; the primary outcome is time to first fatal or nonfatal acute vascular event or revascularization, including acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, acute coronary syndrome admission, or death. CONCLUSIONS: Our randomized controlled trial of the HeartStrong program will provide an evaluation of a state‐of‐the‐art behavioral economic intervention with a number of important pragmatic features. These include a tailored intervention responding to patient activity, streamlining of consent and implementation processes using new technologies, outcomes centrally important to patients, and the ability to implement rapid‐cycle innovation.

AB: Major depression is a highly prevalent, disabling disorder associated with loss of quality of life and large economic burden for the society. Depressive disorders often follow a chronic or recurrent course. The risk of relapses increases with each additional episode. The internet‐deliverable intervention strategy SUMMIT (SUpportive Monitoring and Disease Management over the InTernet) for patients with recurrent depression has been developed with the main objectives to prolong symptom‐free phases and to shorten symptom‐loaden phases. This paper describes the study design of a six‐sites, three‐arm, randomized clinical trial intended to evaluate the efficacy of this novel strategy compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Two hundred thirty six patients who had been treated for their (at least) third depressive episode in one of the six participating psychiatric centers were randomized into one of three groups: 1) TAU plus a twelve‐month SUMMIT program participation with personal support or 2) TAU plus a twelve‐month SUMMIT program participation without personal support, or 3) TAU alone. Primary outcome of this study is defined as the number of "well weeks" over 24months after index treatment assessed by blind evaluators based on the Longitudinal Interval Follow‐Up Evaluation. If efficacious, the low monetary and nonmonetary expenditures of this automated, yet individualized intervention may open new avenues for providing an acceptable, convenient, and affordable long‐term disease management strategy to people with a chronic mental condition such as recurrent depression.

AB: Heart failure (HF) is characterized by high mortality, poor quality of life and frequent hospitalizations. The effectiveness of out‐patient care for HF patients is unsatisfactory. Therefore the solutions that enable effective monitoring and assessment of HF patients' clinical status become priority in treatment strategy. The applicant proposes to develop a model of care for HF patients based on modern non‐invasive diagnostic tools and telemedicine. Clinical evaluation will be based on i.e. impedance cardiography, a simple non‐invasive method of hemodynamic monitoring, including assessment of heart rate, blood pressure, left ventricular stroke volume, chest and total fluid status. The telemedicine system will enable rapid, appropriate to the patient's clinical status, therapeutic decision undertaken remotely by specialist. Implementation of the proposed model of care will contribute to a significant improvement in prognosis of HF patients (through i.e. improved access to specialist consultation, the early diagnosis of the deterioration of HF and the optimization of treatment). The significant economic, social and scientific benefits related to the project are also expected.

TI: Expanding Rural Access to Breastfeeding Support Via Telehealth: the Tele-MILC Trial
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02870413
YR: 2016
AB: Increasing breastfeeding rates is an ongoing public health priority because of the health and economic benefits for infants, mothers, and communities. Professional lactation support, specifically by International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs), increases breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. Rural and underserved mothers have lower breastfeeding rates, and limited access to professional lactation support may contribute to this disparity. As such, the Surgeon General identifies increasing access to IBCLCs as a policy priority. Virtual "telelactation" consults that use two‐way video have the potential to increase access to IBCLC services in rural settings that lack them. Several companies have begun to offer telelactation through a direct‐to‐consumer (DTC) model, where patients initiate video calls with providers using their personal devices including mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. While four studies with small samples explored the use of antiquated videoconferencing technology (i.e., that required dedicated equipment) for lactation support, no research has studied DTC telelactation or linked telelactation with breastfeeding outcomes. To address this evidence gap, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to generate data on the impact of DTC telelactation services. Postpartum mothers age 18 and older who have initiated breastfeeding will be recruited at a critical access hospital without access to IBCLCs in rural Pennsylvania and randomized into two study arms: 1) outpatient telelactation services via video calls on personal devices or 2) usual care. Data on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, as well as perceptions and satisfaction with breastfeeding, will be captured via surveys and in‐depth interviews and compared across groups. This study will be the first experimental evaluation of telelactation and the first ever evaluation of DTC telelactation services. The results will inform policy debates about reimbursement and regulation of DTC telehealth services and the strengths and limitations of this model of healthcare delivery as applied to breastfeeding. It also has the potential to promote breastfeeding, one of the most widely recommended health behaviors among underserved families, and improve children's health in rural settings.

TI: A Tele-mental Health Intervention to Support Parents Caring for a Technology-dependent Child at Home

YR: 2018
KY: Fatigue; Mental Fatigue
AB: Efficacy and Feasibility of a tele‐psychotherapy intervention to support parents caring for a technology‐dependent child at home. Caring for a technology‐dependent child at home is a challenging experience for parents. Global family functioning, lifestyles changes and vocational decisions are affected. Parents of children whose chronic illness require assisted‐technology experience significant emotional stress, potential gaps in social support, and social isolation leading to lower quality of life, unhealthy family functioning, and negative psychological consequences. This study intends to evaluate a tele‐psychotherapy (Tele‐P) intervention as a way to promote the emotional functioning of parents and secondarily increase the quality of life of children that are home technology‐dependent in the Greater Boston Area. The sample will consist of parents of children that are technology‐dependent in the Critical Care, Anesthesia and Perioperative Extension (CAPE) Program at Boston Children's Hospital. Specific Aim 1) To assess the feasibility of delivering a cognitive behavioral Tele‐P intervention for parents of children that are technology‐dependent in the Critical Care, Anesthesia and Perioperative Extension (CAPE) Program at Boston Children's Hospital. Hypothesis 1: Parents and therapist will adhere to 8 psychotherapy sessions via videoconferencing. Hypothesis 2: Cost analysis evaluation will validate the feasibility of the intervention vs. usual care (UC) and standard face‐to‐face therapy sessions. Specific Aim 2) To evaluate the efficacy of a Tele‐P intervention relative to UC in management of mental health conditions amongst parents of children with chronic respiratory failure. Hypothesis 1: Relative to parents assigned to the UC condition, those in the (Tele‐P) condition will: a) demonstrate significant reductions in symptoms of depression, b) significant reductions in symptoms of anxiety and c) significantly less social isolation. Hypothesis 2: Improvement in mental health symptoms will be sustained for the duration of therapy. Specific Aim 3) To assess whether a Tele‐P intervention increases the quality of life of children in the Critical Care, Anesthesia and Perioperative Extension (CAPE) Program at Boston Children's Hospital. Hypothesis 1: Children of parents participating in Tele‐P will show significantly greater improvements in their quality of life relative to their UC counterparts on outcomes of a) physical health, b) mental health (happiness, wellbeing), c) family life, d) free time, and e) general life enjoyment. Background and Significance 'Technology‐dependent' is often used in the literature to describe children "who need both a medical device to compensate for the loss of a vital body function and substantial and ongoing nursing care to avert death or further disability". Approximately 1.2 million children and adolescents in the United States require durable medical equipment to survive. In the early 1990's, surveys estimated that over 2,200 children in Massachusetts were dependent upon some degree of assisted medical technology. The number of ventilator‐dependent children in the Boston community had since increased threefold, representing increased survival of low birth weight infants and those with chronic life‐limiting illnesses. Recent studies have shown that technology‐dependent children comprise 20% of all pediatric patients discharged from the hospital to home, yet they account for 61% of all healthcare resources used by children. While advances in medical care have brought children with chronic health conditions life‐saving and sustaining advances, healthcare systems are inadequately structured to meet their ongoing comprehensive needs. Most of these children are cared for at home by parents and have substantial functional limitations including: self‐care, self‐direction, capacity for independent living and economic self‐sufficiency. The need for assisted technology at home reflects some of the most serious health‐related conditions faced by children with physical and developmental disabilities and their parents. Parenting a child is stressful and challenging, and even under ideal circumstances the care of a child with complex needs requires greater than normal parenting skills. Parents assume an altered parental role, serving as parent, care coordinator, respiratory therapist, nurse, and any other function that is required for 24 hour a day care. The cost of medical care, prescriptions, and durable medical equipment effects families independent of their employment and insurance states. This causes an even greater burden on these already financially, emotionally, and physically stressed parents. Prospects of independence, self‐care, self‐direction with growth are not viable for some of these children, contributing to an indeterminate need for parental effort. Cumulative toll impacts all members of the family and may also impact medical outcomes The investigators previous work showed that the parents of children whose chronic illness require assisted‐technology experience significant emotional stress, potential gaps in social support, and social isolation leading to lower quality of life, unhealthy family functioning, and negative psychological consequences. Approximately 36‐45% of mothers caring for technology dependent children have an escalated risk for clinical depression. Sleep deprivation due to anxiety about a child's condition, false monitor alarms, and the need to remain vigilant over the child during the night is a common theme for parents of technology dependent children. Data suggests sleep disruption places family caregivers at risk for poor health and related outcomes that may impair their daytime function and long term capacity for caregiving. Raising a technology‐dependent child significantly impacts family functioning and hence the quality of life outcomes for the family. Depression and anxiety in parents negatively affects the quality of care a parent can provide their child. Young children exposed to depressed parents run a risk for delay in language, personal social gross motor, and fine motor development. Increase perceived parental burden and consequent family impact may result in negative implications on their own and their children's health related quality of life. Support for parents is crucial not only for the course of the disease of the child but also for the parents' health. In the Greater Boston area there are limited specialized mental health resources and it is increasingly difficult for parents of children that are technology‐dependent to obtain appropriate mental health treatment. Social workers currently have few evidence‐based inventions tested on families with chronically ill children. Immediate action is necessary to provide resources to parents to help them feel motivated, confident and capable of caring for a child. These children are extremely vulnerable and it is imperative to their quality of life that their parents are capable of providing appropriate care. This proposal intends to address this gap in parental care through Tele‐P, a unique therapy via video conference, to help parents cope with these daily stressors. As feelings of depression, anxiety and social isolation decrease, parents should feel more confident and capable of caring for their child. Technology dependent children fully rely on their caregivers in order to not only improve their health but to survive. As Tele‐P improves the mental health of the parent, the child's care and quality of life will also greatly improve. Tele‐P can be successfully used in several therapeutic formats, has similar outcomes as face to face treatment, and is considered satisfactory by most patients and therapist. There are proven to be a number of benefits to home based tele‐mental health including better adherence to appointments, overcoming social isolation, access to contextual information such as the patient's home situation, improved patient and practitioner safety and removal of fears and stigma attached to attending a mental health clinic. Providing therapy through videoconferencing relieves the parents from the stress of traveling with their technology dependent children, which often requires time, resources, (such as an ambulance) and money. For some technology‐dependent children it is also dangerous for them to travel due to their severe diagnosis. Tele‐P allows for the parents to be at home with their child, but at the same time be part of a social interaction. Studies have shown that "facing a high burden of care but still being able to have sufficient social and familial contacts seems to be somewhat protective regarding the mental health of these parents, pointing even stronger towards the importance of social integration". Tele‐P is a unique acceptable and sustainable approach to address the gap in access to services for underserved populations. Feasibility remains a question. The investigators experience with survey completion in this population suggests that time and care demands may be a limiting factor. Given the option of electronic paper survey in a previous study, the majority completed the latter despite computer access. Paper was easier to interrupt and resume if the child's care was needed. There is an urgent need for support of parents with technology‐dependent children. Although researchers have identified a plethora of risks, stressors, and needs of the families with chronically ill child, there is a scarcity of evidence based interventions that address the mental health needs of parents or caregivers of children with developmental disabilities. Providing Tele‐P is a well‐suited approach for these parents and caregivers, who may be overwhelmed by their children's situation, anticipating future challenges and reliving past traumas. The results of the Tele‐P sessions could also be a valuable tool to guide intervention with policies, resources and services that may improve family quality of life and outcomes for families who are raising children with developmental disabilities.

YR: 2016
AB: INTERVENTION: Participants are randomised to one of two groups. Group 1: Participants will be set up with remote device monitoring and arrangements made for a weekly device download to be transmitted to their local study hospital. Some participants may already use remote monitoring but this will be on a much less frequent basis, usually 3 to 6 monthly. The weekly downloads will be reviewed by the nurse or cardiac technician who are the “trained study remote monitor”. The monitor will review the weekly downloads and take any appropriate actions which are then documented as part of the study data. Group 2: Participants will have their device care managed according to the usual care in their local hospital. Both groups will be contacted by telephone at 3, 6, 12 month and yearly following enrolment to ask about their progress. Data regarding their progress will be collected from the telephone follow up and supported by hospital and GP medical records. All participants will be required to complete “Quality of Life” (QOL) questionnaires at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months following enrolment. The latter 4 QOL questionnaires may be sent in the post. Depending on the date of their enrolment each participant will be followed up in the study for up to 4 years with a minimum of 2 years follow up. CONDITION: Heart failure ; Circulatory System ; Heart failure PRIMARY OUTCOME: Combined all‐cause mortality (ACM) or unplanned cardiovascular (CV) hospitalisation (whichever comes first) rate is determined through follow up interviews at 3, 6, 12 month, 2 years and for the early recruiters up to 4 years. Data will be collected from a combination of participant interviews, reviewing hospital and GP records and by obtaining copies of death certificates where available from the Health and Social Care Information Centre. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Unless otherwise stated, secondary outcome measures will be measured at the last follow‐up or at the last available observation within the two year follow‐up period.; ; 1. Time to death is measured by time from randomisation to date of death; 2. Time to a cardiovascular related death is measured by time from randomisation to date of death; 3. Time to a non‐cardiovascular related death is measured by time from randomisation to date of death; 4. Time to first unplanned hospitalisation for cardiovascular reasons or cardiovascular related death is measured by time from randomisation to date of event; 5. Time to first unplanned hospitalisation for non‐cardiovascular reasons or death by any cause is measured by time from randomisation to date of event; 6. Time to first unplanned hospitalisation for cardiovascular reasons is measured by time from randomisation to date of event; 7. Time to first unplanned hospitalisation for non‐cardiovascular reasons is measured by time from randomisation to date of event; 8. Total number of unplanned hospitalisations is measured by the total number of these episodes during the follow up period; 9. Total number of unplanned hospitalisations for cardiovascular reasons is measured by the total number of these episodes during the follow‐up period; 10. Health related quality of life is measured using the SF12 (physical and mental health components) at baseline,3 month, 6 month, 12 month, 1 and 2 years; 11.Health related quality of life is measured using the EQ5D at baseline, 3 month, 6 month, 12 month, 1 and 2 years; 12.Health related quality of life is measured using the KCCQ at baseline, 3 month, 6 month, 12 month, 1 and 2 years; 13. Number and cost of hospitalisations is measured by applying the national tariff costs to the hospitalisation episodes; 14. Difference in cost of resources consumed is measured by applying appropriate costs to both arms of the studies and comparing these for the duration of the study; 15. Difference in cost of cardiovascular related health care use is measured by applying the appropriate costs to both arms of the studies and comparing these for the duration of the study; 16. Incremental costs per quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) is measured by dividing the difference in costs between both arms of the study by the difference in QALYs between the arms INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1.Participants will all have received an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD), Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy‐Pacemaker (CRT‐P) or Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy‐Defibrillator (CRT‐D) at least six months previously, for the treatment and monitoring of chronic heart failure 2.Be on stable medical therapy for CHF for 6 weeks prior to recruitment 3.Will have the ability to independently comprehend and complete Quality of Life Questionnaires 4.

TI: Stepped Telemental Health Care Intervention for Depression
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct01906476
YR: 2013
KY: Depression; Depressive Disorder
AB: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, with 12‐month prevalence rates estimated to be between 6.6‐10.3%. While many depressed patients state they would prefer psychological treatment to pharmacotherapy, substantial barriers to care exist, including cost, practical barriers such as time constraints and transportation, emotional barriers such as stigma, decreased motivation associated with depression itself, physical disability, and lack of availability of services. Telemental health has been proposed as a method of overcoming barriers to treatment. Research has focused primarily on two formats: the telephone and the Internet. Use of the telephone as a delivery medium produces reductions in depression equivalent to face‐to‐face psychological treatments, while also significantly reducing attrition. However, its success in outreach can also significantly increase costs for healthcare providing organizations. Internet interventions have the potential to produce moderate gains when supported by therapist or coach via brief telephone calls or e‐mail but are also less expensive than standard therapy. Developing healthcare models that integrate treatment delivery media holds the promise of harnessing the advantages of each media, while minimizing the disadvantages. Stepped care models are a potentially useful framework for achieving such an integration. The stepped care model we will test initiates treatment with a validated, guided Internet cognitive behavioral therapy program. If patients fail to respond, they will be stepped up to a validated telephone‐cognitive behavior therapy (T‐CBT). The stepped care model will be compared to T‐CBT in a randomized trial. Patients will be recruited from primary care and treated for up to 20 weeks, or until sustained remission is achieved.

AB: Hypothesis/aims of study What is the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of active conservative treatment delivered by a specialist continence physiotherapist or a specialist continence nurse compared with standard management, primarily in terms of regaining urinary continence at 12 months after recruitment, in two groups: men with urinary incontinence at six weeks after a radical prostatectomy or a transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)? The hypothesis tested in each group of men (in two parallel but separate trials, one amongst men having a radical prostatectomy and the other amongst those having a TURP) was that active conservative management would result in an absolute difference of 15% between the groups in the proportion of incontinent men at one year after recruitment. Study design, materials and methods Men having prostate surgery were identified in 34 centres and invited to receive a screening questionnaire at three weeks after operation. Those men who had urinary incontinence (UI) were randomised. Men in the intervention group were randomised to attending four sessions with a Therapist over a period of three months. Instruction included pelvic floor muscle training and bladder training / urge suppression. The Control group continued with standard management. Both groups received a Lifestyle Advice Leaflet. Randomisation was by computer allocation using a remote randomisation service. Allocation was stratified by type of operation (radical prostatectomy or transurethral resection of prostate, TURP), and minimised using centre, age and preexisting urinary incontinence. The process was independent of all clinical collaborators. Outcome measures were UI, performance of pelvic floor muscle exercises, bowel and sexual dysfunction and quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs). UI was assessed using the ICI‐UI Short Form survey instrument (www.iciq.net) by postal questionnaires. Analysis was by intention to treat adjusting for age and pre‐existing UI. Further sensitivity analyses were carried out using the 'adjusted treatment received' method described by Nagelkerke and colleagues (2000). Results Of those eligible, 95% (742/780) in the radical prostatectomy group, and 91% (2590/2836) in the TURP group were screened: 411 and 442 respectively were randomised. After a radical prostatectomy, but before randomisation, 98% of men had already received some information about pelvic floor muscle training from a wide variety of sources including continence advisors, leaflets or books, doctors, friends or family, the internet or a physiotherapist; as had around 80% of men after a TURP. Radical prostatectomy trial: Amongst men who had a radical prostatectomy, follow‐up rates were over 97% in each arm. Ninety‐two percent of the men in the intervention group attended at least one therapy visit and these men were more likely to be carrying out any pelvic floor muscle training at 12 months (67%) compared with those in the control group (20%, adjusted risk ratio RR 1.30; [95% CI 1.09 to 1.53]). In the radical trial, the absolute risk difference in urinary incontinence rates at 12 months between the intervention (75.5%) and control (77.4%) groups was ‐1.9% [‐10% to 6%], which rules out the likelihood that the prespecified target difference of 15% was missed. Adjusting for minimisation factors or performing a 'treatment received' analysis did not change these results. Although there was a trend towards higher NHS costs in the intervention group and higher societal costs in the control group, differences were not statistically significant. On average, QALYs were virtually identical in both the intervention and control group (MD 0.002 [95%CI ‐0.023 to 0.027]). When the perspective was the NHS there was only a 20% chance that pelvic floor muscle training would be cost‐effective. TURP trial: Amongst men who had a TURP, follow up was 97% in both arms. Over 85% of men in the intervention group attended at least one therapy visit and these men were more likely to be carrying out any pelvic floor muscle training at 12 months after randomisation (65%) than those in the control group (20%, adjusted RR 3.20 [2.37 to 4.32]). Following a TURP, the absolute risk difference in urinary incontinence rates at 12 months between the intervention (64.9%) and control (61.5%) groups for the unadjusted intention to treat analysis was 3.4% [95% CI ‐6% to 13%], which rules out the likelihood that the prespecified target difference of 15% was missed. NHS costs and societal costs were statistically significantly higher in the intervention group but QALYs were virtually identical. From both a societal and an NHS perspective there was little chance that pelvic floor muscle training would be considered cost‐effective. Interpretation of results The provision of one‐to‐one conservative physical therapy for men with urinary incontinence after prostate surgery is unlikely to be effective or cost‐effective compared with the extensive provision of information about conducting pelvic floor muscle training that is available in the medical and the public domain. Concluding message Any resources currently allocated to providing pelvic floor muscle training by a trained therapist in one‐to‐one consultations for men with incontinence after prostate surgery could be better used elsewhere.

AB: Background: Connected health devices with lifestyle coaching can provide real‐time support for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the intensity of lifestyle coaching needed to achieve outcomes is unknown. Methods: Livongo provides connected, two‐way messaging glucose meters, unlimited blood glucose (BG) test strips, and access to certified diabetes educators. We evaluated the incremental effects of adding lifestyle coaching on BG, estimated HbA1c, and weight. We randomized 330 eligible adults (T2D, HbA1c > 7.5%, BMI ≥ 25) to receive no further intervention (n = 75), a connected scale (n = 115), scale plus lightweight coaching (n = 73), or scale plus intense coaching (n = 67) for 12 weeks. We evaluated the change in outcomes using ANOVA. Results: Livongo participation alone resulted in improved BG control (mean HbA1c declined: 8.5% to 7.5%, p = 0.01). Mean weight loss and additional BG decreases were higher in the intensive compared with the lightweight coaching and scale‐only groups (weight change (lb): ‐6.4, ‐4.1, and ‐1.1, resp., p = 0.01; BG change (mg/dL): ‐19.4, ‐11.3, and ‐2.9, resp., p = 0.02). The estimated 12‐week program costs were 5.5 times more for intensive than lightweight coaching. Conclusion: Livongo participation significantly improves BG control in people with T2D. Additional lifestyle coaching may be a cost‐effective intervention to achieve further glucose control and weight loss.

AB: Introduction: Pressure ulcers (PU) are the most common chronic wounds in all levels of care in health centers. The chronic wound care by skilled personnel is key to healing and management of these injuries. An inter‐clinical telematic program for PU in Primary Care (PC) can improve the effectiveness of interventions and cost savings. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and costs reduction after the implementation in PC setting of a chronic wounds reference nurse and a teleconsultation program aimed to nurses for the management of PU in patients in home care setting. Methodology: A prospective pilot clinical trial in which 46 primary care nurses in Osakidetza will be randomly assigned to two parallel groups: experimental group and control group. Each nurse will recruit at least 1 new patient in home care with PU in stage II‐III. The intervention will consist of a telematic advice from the reference nurse regarding chronic wound management in relation to a specific PU. Patients will be monitored for 8 weeks with a minimum of 4 repeated measurements of the Resvech Index 2.0. To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, multilevel models or linear mixed models to take into account the auto‐correlation at the individual level and nurse, will be used

AB: Adolescents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are an underserved group in need of weight management. However, information regarding effective weight management for this group is limited, and is based primarily on results from small, non‐powered, non‐randomized trials that were not conducted in accordance with current weight management guidelines. Additionally, the comparative effectiveness of emerging dietary approaches, such as portion‐controlled meals (PCMs) or program delivery strategies such as video chat using tablet computers have not been evaluated. Therefore, we will conduct an 18month trial to compare weight loss (6months) and maintenance (7‐18months) in 123 overweight/obese adolescents with mild to moderate IDD, and a parent, randomized to a weight management intervention delivered remotely using FaceTime™ on an iPad using either a conventional meal plan diet (RD/CD) or a Stop Light diet enhanced with PCMs (RD/eSLD), or conventional diet delivered during face‐to‐face home visits (FTF/CD). This design will provide an adequately powered comparison of both diet (CD vs. eSLD) and delivery strategy (FTF vs. RD). Exploratory analyses will examine the influence of behavioral session attendance, compliance with recommendations for diet (energy intake), physical activity (min/day), self‐monitoring of diet and physical activity, medications, and parental variables including diet quality, physical activity, baseline weight, weight change, and beliefs and attitudes regarding diet and physical activity on both weight loss and maintenance. We will also complete a cost and contingent valuation analysis to compare costs between RD and FTF delivery.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer recurrence. Rural women have higher obesity rates compared with urban women and are in need of distance‐based interventions that promote long‐term weight loss. METHODS: In this two‐phase trial, rural breast cancer survivors who lost >5% of their starting weight during a 6‐month lifestyle intervention (delivered through weekly group conference calls) were randomized to one of two 12‐month interventions for weight loss maintenance: continued biweekly phone‐based group counseling or mailed newsletters. The primary outcome was weight regain from 6 to 18 months. Secondary outcomes included dichotomous measures of weight change and costs. RESULTS: Mean weight loss at 6 months was 14.0 ± 5.1%. Participants in the group phone condition regained less weight (3.3 ± 4.8 kg) compared with participants in the newsletter condition (4.9 ± 4.8 kg; P = 0.03). At 18 months, 75.3% of participants in the group phone condition remained ≥5% below baseline weight compared with 57.8% in the newsletter condition (P = 0.02). Incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios were $882 to keep one more person ≥5% below baseline weight. CONCLUSIONS: A lifestyle intervention incorporating group phone‐based support improved the magnitude of weight loss maintained and increased the proportion of survivors who maintained clinically significant reductions.

AB: Introduction: Telerehabilitation enables patients to access remote rehabilitation services for patient‐physiotherapist videoconferencing in their own homes. Home‐based virtual reality (VR) balance training has been shown to reduce postural instability in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The primary aim was to compare improvements in postural stability after remotely supervised in‐home VR balance training and in‐clinic sensory integration balance training (SIBT). Methods: In this multicenter study, 76 PD patients (modified Hoehn and Yahr stages 2.5‐3) were randomly assigned to receive either in‐home VR telerehabilitation (n = 38) or in‐clinic SIBT (n = 38) in 21 sessions of 50 minutes each, 3 days/week for 7 consecutive weeks. VR telerehabilitation consisted of graded exergames using the Nintendo Wii Fit system; SIBT included exercises to improve postural stability. Patients were evaluated before treatment, after treatment, and at 1‐month follow‐up. Results: Analysis revealed significant between‐group differences in improvement on the Berg Balance Scale for the VR telerehabilitation group (p = 0.04) and significant Time × Group interactions in the Dynamic Gait Index (p = 0.04) for the in‐clinic group. Both groups showed differences in all outcome measures over time, except for fall frequency. Cost comparison yielded between‐group differences in treatment and equipment costs. Conclusions: VR is a feasible alternative to in‐clinic SIBT for reducing postural instability in PD patients having a caregiver.

TI: Remote Brief Intervention and Referrals to Treatment Service for Alcohol
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02622984
YR: 2015
KY: Alcoholism; Ethanol
AB: Significance: The USPHSTF, SAMHSA, CDC, and NIAAA have affirmed the importance of screening in medical settings for alcohol consumption that exceeds the NIAAA low risk limits, brief educational and motivational counseling for those who screen positive or have other evidence of an Alcohol Use Disorder, and, when appropriate, referral to treatment (SBIRT). However, translation to clinical practice continues to be elusive. Polaris Health Directions (Small Business) and the University of Massachusetts Medical School (Research Institute) have partnered to solve this problem by creating the Remote Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment service for alcohol (R‐BIRT), a telehealth service for delivering evidence based alcohol brief interventions and referral to treatment during a medical encounter in a cost‐effective, sustainable way. Investigators: The investigators have extensive expertise in SBIRT for alcohol (Boudreaux, Bernstein); telehealth (Boudreaux); development, testing, and marketing of behavioral intervention technologies (Boudreaux, Harralson); comparative effectiveness trial design and analysis (Barton); and health economics (Sachs). Combined, the team has over 100 publications related to SBIRT and constituent technology domains. Innovation: This Phase 2 STTR will pioneer telehealth delivery of SBIRT for alcohol. It will be flexible enough for a variety of medical settings, and will develop and expand software capable of facilitating both telehealth and in‐person SBIRT delivery models. It will further innovate SBIRT research and clinical practice by exploring mechanisms of action, an objective rarely incorporated into SBIRT studies. Approach: The design is a two arm, single blind (outcomes assessor), randomized, non‐inferiority trial. Emergency department (ED) patients (n=356) who drink above the NIAAA low risk limits or have evidence of an Alcohol Use Disorder will be randomized to the telehealth model (R‐BIRT) or a gold‐standard in‐person intervention (SBIRT) and followed for 6 months post‐visit using a multi‐method outcomes attainment plan. The study will establish the non‐inferiority of the telehealth model compared to the in‐person model in reducing alcohol use and alcohol related consequences, while showing that the telehealth model is the more cost effective of the two. Mechanisms of action, including patient knowledge of low risk drinking limits, motivation, self‐efficacy, substance abuse treatment initiation, and self‐help program engagement, will be examined. Environment: With the success of the R‐BIRT Phase 1 and other relevant projects, including previous large scale Phase 2 STTR clinical trials, Polaris and UMass have clearly established their capability of successfully carrying out this study, disseminating its results, and marketing the final product. Impact: Because alcohol misuse, abuse, and dependence carries an enormous burden in both human suffering and healthcare costs, a strategy that provides high quality, evidence based care in a manner that is more cost effective and easier than existing models has potential to exert a substantial impact on public health.

TI: Practical Telemedicine to Improve Control and Engagement for Veterans With Clinic-Refractory Diabetes Mellitus
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03520413
YR: 2018
KY: Diabetes Mellitus
AB: This study will evaluate a comprehensive telemedicine intervention for Veterans with persistently poor diabetes control despite clinic‐based Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care. Because this approach is designed for delivery via existing Home Telehealth (HT) services, which are ubiquitous throughout VHA, it may represent an effective, practical alternative for Veterans whose diabetes is refractory to clinic‐based care. Although efforts by clinicians and researchers have improved diabetes control across VHA, Veterans with persistent poorly‐controlled diabetes mellitus (PPDM) have not benefitted from these advances. The investigators define PPDM as maintenance of a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 8.5% for >1 year, despite receiving clinic‐based diabetes care during this period. Veterans meeting this definition ‐ approximately 12% of all Veterans with type 2 diabetes ‐ contribute disproportionately to VHA's burden of diabetes complications and costs. While clinic‐based care is insufficiently effective in PPDM, telemedicine‐based management that comprehensively addresses factors underlying poor diabetes control could improve outcomes for these high‐risk Veterans. Unfortunately, healthcare systems have rarely integrated comprehensive telemedicine‐based care into real‐world practice, even for clinic‐refractory conditions like PPDM. This gap stems from the fact that comprehensive telemedicine‐based diabetes care has not previously been designed for practical delivery under real‐world conditions. In order for telemedicine to fulfill its potential as a means to reduce the burden of PPDM, interventions must be developed with an emphasis on feasible delivery through existing workforce, infrastructure, and technical resources, such that effective implementation is eventually achievable. Until then, Veterans with PPDM will be left without alternatives when clinic‐based care proves inadequate. The proposed trial will evaluate Practical Telemedicine to Improve Control and Engagement for Veterans with Clinic‐Refractory Diabetes Mellitus (PRACTICE‐DM), a novel, comprehensive telemedicine intervention for PPDM that is designed for practical delivery within VHA. The Specific Aims of this study are to: 1) determine PRACTICE‐DM's effectiveness; 2) evaluate PRACTICE‐DM's acceptability and mechanisms of effect using a mixed method process evaluation; and 3) understand costs associated with PRACTICE‐DM. Two hundred Veterans with PPDM from two sites (Durham, NC and Richmond, VA) will be randomized to receive one of two HT‐delivered interventions: 1) PRACTICE‐DM, a comprehensive intervention combining telemonitoring, self‐management support, diet/activity support, medication management, and depression support; or 2) an active control, standard HT care coordination and telemonitoring. Both interventions will be delivered over a 12‐month period and all participants will continue to receive usual VHA care. The primary study outcome will be change in HbA1c from study baseline to 12 months. The secondary outcomes are guided by a theoretical framework, and will include diabetes self‐care, diabetes burden, self‐efficacy, and depressive symptoms. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 20 intervention‐group Veterans, the HT nurses delivering the intervention, and administrators at each site. Intervention costs will be comprehensively assessed and compared to standard HT care coordination and telemonitoring. Although VHA is a leader in telemedicine, its telemedicine capabilities are currently underutilized for Veterans with PPDM. These Veterans are refractory to clinic‐based care, so contribute disproportionately to diabetes complications and costs. This study will leverage VHA's unique telemedicine infrastructure to deliver comprehensive management designed for PPDM, with the goal of improving outcomes in this high‐risk, high cost population. Because the proposed intervention is designed for delivery using existing HT services, it may represent an effective, practical approach to reducing the burden of poor diabetes control across VHA.

AB: BACKGROUND: No drug treatments are currently licensed for the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Despite this, people with this condition are frequently prescribed psychotropic medications and often with considerable polypharmacy. Preliminary studies have indicated that mood stabilisers may be of benefit to people with BPD. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of lamotrigine for people with BPD. DESIGN: A two‐arm, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled individually randomised trial of lamotrigine versus placebo. Participants were randomised via an independent and remote web‐based service using permuted blocks and stratified by study centre, the severity of personality disorder and the extent of hypomanic symptoms. SETTING: Secondary care NHS mental health services in six centres in England. PARTICIPANTS: Potential participants had to be aged ≥ 18 years, meet diagnostic criteria for BPD and provide written informed consent. We excluded people with coexisting psychosis or bipolar affective disorder, those already taking a mood stabiliser, those who spoke insufficient English to complete the baseline assessment and women who were pregnant or contemplating becoming pregnant. INTERVENTIONS: Up to 200 mg of lamotrigine per day or an inert placebo. Women taking combined oral contraceptives were prescribed up to 400 mg of trial medication per day. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were assessed at 12, 24 and 52 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcome was the total score on the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN‐BPD) at 52 weeks. The secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, deliberate self‐harm, social functioning, health‐related quality of life, resource use and costs, side effects of treatment and adverse events. Higher scores on all measures indicate poorer outcomes. RESULTS: Between July 2013 and October 2015 we randomised 276 participants, of whom 195 (70.6%) were followed up 52 weeks later. At 52 weeks, 49 (36%) of those participants prescribed lamotrigine and 58 (42%) of those prescribed placebo were taking it. At 52 weeks, the mean total ZAN‐BPD score was 11.3 [standard deviation (SD) 6.6] among those participants randomised to lamotrigine and 11.5 (SD 7.7) among those participants randomised to placebo (adjusted mean difference 0.1, 95% CI ‐1.8 to 2.0; p = 0.91). No statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes were seen at any time. Adjusted costs of direct care for those prescribed lamotrigine were similar to those prescribed placebo. LIMITATIONS: Levels of adherence in this pragmatic trial were low, but greater adherence was not associated with better mental health. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of lamotrigine to the usual care of people with BPD was not found to be clinically effective or provide a cost‐effective use of resources. FUTURE WORK: Future research into the treatment of BPD should focus on improving the evidence base for the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of non‐pharmacological treatments to help policy‐makers make better decisions about investing in specialist treatment services.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of referral to group art therapy plus standard care, compared with referral to an activity group plus standard care and standard care alone, among people with schizophrenia. DESIGN: A three‐arm, parallel group, single‐blind, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomised via an independent and remote telephone randomisation service using permuted blocks, stratified by study centre. SETTING: Study participants were recruited from secondary care mental health and social services in four UK centres. PARTICIPANTS: Potential participants were aged 18 years or over, had a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia, confirmed by an examination of case notes, and provided written informed consent. We excluded those who were unable to speak sufficient English to complete the baseline assessment, those with severe cognitive impairment and those already receiving arts therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Group art therapy was delivered by registered art therapists according to nationally agreed standards. Groups had up to eight members, lasted for 90 minutes and ran for 12 months. Members were given access to a range of art materials and encouraged to use these to express themselves freely. Activity groups were designed to control for the non‐specific effects of group art therapy. Group facilitators offered various activities and encouraged participants to collectively select those they wanted to pursue. Standard care involved follow‐up from secondary care mental health services and the option of referral to other services, except arts therapies, as required. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Our co‐primary outcomes were global functioning (measured using the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale ‐ GAF) and mental health symptoms (measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ‐ PANSS) at 24 months. The main secondary outcomes were level of group attendance, social functioning, well‐being, health‐related quality of life, service utilisation and other costs measured 12 and 24 months after randomisation. RESULTS: Four hundred and seventeen people were recruited, of whom 355 (85%) were followed up at 2 years. Eighty‐six (61%) of those randomised to art therapy and 73 (52%) of those randomised to activity groups attended at least one group. No differences in primary outcomes were found between the three study arms. The adjusted mean difference between art therapy and standard care at 24 months was ‐0.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.8 to 2.1] on the GAF Scale and 0.7 (95% CI ‐3.1 to 4.6) on the PANSS Scale. Differences in secondary outcomes were not found, except that those referred to an activity group had fewer positive symptoms of schizophrenia at 24 months than those randomised to art therapy. Secondary analysis indicated that attendance at art therapy groups was not associated with improvements in global functioning or mental health. Although the total cost of the art therapy group was lower than the cost of the two comparison groups, referral to group art therapy did not appear to provide a cost‐effective use of resources. CONCLUSIONS: Referring people with established schizophrenia to group art therapy as delivered in this randomised trial does not appear to improve global functioning or mental health of patients or provide a more cost‐effective use of resources than standard care alone.

AB: Background and objectives: Schedules for follow‐up of teenagers with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have traditionally been based on providing reassurance, rather than on an estimate of the likelihood of intervening to treat a disease flare. We assessed if a calprotectin‐based telemonitoring programme with rapid access to specialist care when need arises could be of benefit for patients with a stable disease course. Methods: In a prospective multicenter trial we randomly assigned teenagers (10‐19 years) with quiescent disease at baseline to the telemonitoring or usual care arm. Teenagers assigned to telemonitoring had biannual checks, and received automated email alerts to fill in a symptom score and to send a stool sample for calprotectin measurement between scheduled visits. Teenagers in the usual care group had regular scheduled visits. After 52 weeks of follow‐up we evaluated the cumulative incidence of disease flares per group, defined as increased symptoms necessitating therapy intensification. Secondary outcomes included the quality‐of‐life score at end of study (assessed with IMPACT‐III), cost effectiveness from a societal perspective, and predictors of successful telemonitoring. Results: We included 170 participants, 84 assigned to telemonitoring and 86 to usual care. After 52 weeks of follow‐up, the percentages of patients with a disease flare were similar in both arms (respectively 33 and 34%). The quality‐of‐life score at the end of the study favoured the telemonitoring arm (79 vs 75, P=0.02). Telemonitoring saved €360 per patient annually, provided that patients responded to at least 80% of the automated alerts. A higher emotional quotient and living further away from the hospital were predictors of better compliance to the telemonitoring programme. Conclusions: Calprotectin‐assisted telemonitoring of teenagers with IBD seems as effective and safe as traditional care. Better disease specific quality‐of‐life and lower costs make this telemedicine solution the preferred strategy for monitoring teenagers with a stable disease course.

AB: Background Drawbacks exist with the standard treatment (four‐layer compression bandages) for venous leg ulcers. We have therefore compared the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of two‐layer compression hosiery with the four‐layer bandage for the treatment of such ulcers. Methods We undertook this pragmatic, open, randomised controlled trial with two parallel groups in 34 centres in England and Northern Ireland. The centres were community nurse teams or services, family doctor practices, leg ulcer clinics, tissue viability clinics or services, and wound clinics. Participants were aged 18 years or older with a venous leg ulcer and an ankle brachial pressure index of at least 0·8, and were tolerant of high compression. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) to receive two‐layer compression hosiery or a four‐layer bandage, using a remote randomisation service and prevalidated computer randomisation program. Participants were stratified by ulcer duration and ulcer area with permuted blocks (block sizes four and six). The primary endpoint was time to ulcer healing, with a maximum follow‐up of 12 months. Although participants and health‐care providers were not masked to treatment allocation, the primary endpoint was measured by masked assessment of photographs. Primary analysis was intention to treat with Cox regression, with adjustment for ulcer area, ulcer duration, physical mobility, and centre. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN register, number ISRCTN49373072. Findings We randomly allocated 457 participants to the two treatment groups: 230 to two‐layer hosiery and 227 to the four‐layer bandage, of whom 453 (230 hosiery and 223 bandage) contributed data for analysis. Median time to ulcer healing was 99 days (95% CI 84‐126) in the hosiery group and 98 days (85‐112) in the bandage group, and the proportion of ulcers healing was much the same in the two groups (70·9% hosiery and 70·4% bandage). More hosiery participants changed their allocated treatment (38·3% hosiery vs 27·0% bandage; p=0·02). 300 participants had 895 adverse events, of which 85 (9·5%) were classed as serious but unrelated to trial treatment. Interpretation Two‐layer compression hosiery is a viable alternative to the four‐layer bandage ‐ it is equally as effective at healing venous leg ulcers. However, a higher rate of treatment changes in participants in the hosiery group than in the bandage group suggests that hosiery might not be suitable for all patients.

AB: Objective: To study the effectiveness of an integrated intervention of health worker training, a low‐cost ecological mosquito ovitrap, and community engagement on Aedes spp. mosquito control over 10 months in 2015 in an urban remote community in Guatemala at risk of dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus transmission. Methods: We implemented a three‐component integrated intervention consisting of: web‐based training of local health personnel in vector control, cluster‐randomized assignment of ecological ovillantas or standard ovitraps to capture Aedes aegypti mosquito eggs, and community engagement to promote participation of community members and health personnel in the understanding and maintenance of ovitraps for mosquito control. The intervention was implemented in local collaboration with the Ministry of Health's Vector Control Programme, and in international collaboration with the National Institute of Public Health in Mexico. Findings: Eighty percent of the 25 local health personnel enrolled in the training programme received accreditation of their improved knowledge of vector control. Significantly more eggs were trapped by ecological ovillantas than standard ovitraps over the 10 month (42 week) study period (t=5.2577; p < 0.05). Among both community members and health workers, the levels of knowledge, interest, and participation in community mosquito control and trapping increased. Recommendations for enhancing and sustaining community mosquito control were identified. Conclusion: Our three‐component integrated intervention proved beneficial to this remote community at risk of mosquito‐borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The combination of training of health workers, low‐cost ecological ovillanta to destroy the second generation of mosquitoes, and community engagement ensured the project met local needs and fostered collaboration and participation of the community, which can help improve sustainability. The ovillanta intervention and methodology may be modified to target other species such as Culex, should it be established that such mosquitoes carry Zika virus in addition to Aedes.

AB: BACKGROUND: Drawbacks exist with the standard treatment (four‐layer compression bandages) for venous leg ulcers. We have therefore compared the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of two‐layer compression hosiery with the four‐layer bandage for the treatment of such ulcers.

AB: Background: Ankle sprains are one of the most frequent injuries of the musculoskeletal system, with yearly around 680.000 new sprains in the Netherlands. Of these, about 130.000 people will visit the general practitioner (GP) each year. In addition, patients have an increased risk of a recurrent ankle sprain and about a third report at least one re‐sprain. No optimal treatment strategy has proven to be effective in general practice, however promising results were achieved in a preventive trial among athletes. Therefore, the objective is to examine the (cost)‐effectiveness of an unsupervised e‐health supported neuromuscular training program in combination with usual care in general practice compared to usual care alone in patients with acute ankle sprains in general practice. Method/Design: This study is a multi‐center, open‐label randomized controlled trial, with a one‐year follow‐up. Patients with an acute lateral ankle sprain, aged between 14 and 65 years and visiting the GP within three weeks of injury are eligible for inclusion. Patients will be randomized in two study groups. The intervention group will receive, in addition to usual care, a standardized eight‐week neuromuscular training program guided by an App. The control group will receive usual care in general practice alone. The primary outcome of this study is the total number of ankle sprain recurrences reported during one year follow‐up. Secondary outcomes are subjective recovery after one year follow‐up, pain at rest and during activity, function, return to sport, cost‐effectiveness and compliance of the intervention. Measurements will take place monthly for the study period of 12 months after baseline measurement. Discussion: For general practitioners the treatment of acute ankle sprains is a challenge. A neuromuscular training program that has proven to be effective for athletes might be a direct treatment tool for acute ankle sprains in general practice. Positive results of this randomized controlled trial can lead to changes in practice guidelines for general practitioners. In addition, since this training program is e‐health supported, positive results can also lead to a novel way of injury prevention. Trial registration: Dutch Trial Registration: NTR4765.

AB: Background: Patients with neovascular age‐related macular degeneration (nAMD) usually attend regular reviews, even when the disease is quiescent. Reviews are burdensome to health services, patients and carers. Objectives: To compare the proportion of correct lesion classifications made by community‐based optometrists and ophthalmologists from vignettes of patients; to estimate the cost‐effectiveness of community follow‐up by optometrists compared with follow‐up by ophthalmologists in the Hospital Eye Service (HES); to ascertain views of patients, their representatives, optometrists, ophthalmologists and clinical commissioners on the proposed shared care model. Design: Community‐based optometrists and ophthalmologists in the HES classified lesions from vignettes comprising clinical information, colour fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography images. Participants' classifications were validated against experts' classifications (reference standard). Setting: Internet‐based application. Participants: Ophthalmologists had to have > 3 years post‐registration experience in ophthalmology, have passed part 1 of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, Diploma in Ophthalmology or equivalent examination, and have experience in the age‐related macular degeneration service. Optometrists had to be fully qualified, be registered with the General Optical Council for > 3 years and not be participating in nAMD shared care. Interventions: The trial sought to emulate a conventional trial in comparing optometrists' and ophthalmologists' decision‐making, but vignettes, not patients, were assessed; therefore, there were no interventions. Participants received training prior to assessing vignettes. Main outcome measures: Primary outcome ‐ correct classification of the activity status of a lesion based on a vignette, compared with a reference standard. Secondary outcomes ‐ frequencies of potentially sight‐threatening errors, participants' judgements about specific lesion components, participant‐rated confidence in their decisions and cost‐effectiveness of follow‐up by community‐based optometrists compared with HES ophthalmologists. Results: In total, 155 participants registered for the trial; 96 (48 in each professional group) completed training and main assessments and formed the analysis population. Optometrists and ophthalmologists achieved 1702 out of 2016 (84.4%) and 1722 out of 2016 (85.4%) correct classifications, respectively [odds ratio (OR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.25; p = 0.543]. Optometrists' decisionmaking was non‐inferior to ophthalmologists' with respect to the pre‐specified limit of 10% absolute difference (0.298 on the odds scale). Frequencies of sight‐threatening errors were similar for optometrists and ophthalmologists [57/994 (5.7%) vs. 62/994 (6.2%), OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.57; p = 0.789]. Ophthalmologists assessed lesion components as present less often than optometrists and were more confident about their lesion classifications than optometrists. The mean care‐pathway cost for assessment was very similar by group, namely 397.33 for ophthalmologists and 410.78 for optometrists. The optometrist‐led monitoring reviews were slightly more costly and less effective than ophthalmologist‐led reviews, although the differences were extremely small. There was consensus that optometrist‐led monitoring has the potential to reduce clinical workload and be more patient‐centred. However, potential barriers are ophthalmologists' perceptions of optometrists' competence, the need for clinical training, the ability of the professions to work collaboratively and the financial feasibility of shared care for Clinical Commissioning Groups. Conclusions: The ability of optometrists to make nAMD retreatment decisions from vignettes is non‐inferior to that of ophthalmologists. Various barriers to implementing shared cared for nAMD were identified. Copyright © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.

DOI: 10.3310/hta21370
AB: BACKGROUND: The Obsessive‐Compulsive Treatment Efficacy randomised controlled Trial emerged from a research recommendation in National Institute for Health and Care Excellence obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD) guidelines, which specified the need to evaluate cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) treatment intensity formats. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of two low‐intensity CBT interventions [supported computerised cognitive‐behavioural therapy (cCBT) and guided self‐help]: (1) compared with waiting list for high‐intensity CBT in adults with OCD at 3 months; and (2) plus high‐intensity CBT compared with waiting list plus high‐intensity CBT in adults with OCD at 12 months. To determine patient and professional acceptability of low‐intensity CBT interventions. DESIGN: A three‐arm, multicentre, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services and primary/secondary care mental health services in 15 NHS trusts. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders‐Fourth Edition criteria for OCD, on a waiting list for high‐intensity CBT and scoring ≥ 16 on the Yale‐Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (indicative of at least moderate severity OCD) and able to read English. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to (1) supported cCBT, (2) guided self‐help or (3) a waiting list for high‐intensity CBT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was OCD symptoms using the Yale‐Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ‐ Observer Rated. RESULTS: Patients were recruited from 14 NHS trusts between February 2011 and May 2014. Follow‐up data collection was complete by May 2015. There were 475 patients randomised: supported cCBT (n = 158); guided self‐help (n = 158) and waiting list for high‐intensity CBT (n = 159). Two patients were excluded post randomisation (one supported cCBT and one waiting list for high‐intensity CBT); therefore, data were analysed for 473 patients. In the short term, prior to accessing high‐intensity CBT, guided self‐help demonstrated statistically significant benefits over waiting list, but these benefits did not meet the prespecified criterion for clinical significance [adjusted mean difference ‐1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐3.27 to ‐0.55; p = 0.006]. Supported cCBT did not demonstrate any significant benefit (adjusted mean difference ‐0.71, 95% CI ‐2.12 to 0.70). In the longer term, access to guided self‐help and supported cCBT, prior to high‐intensity CBT, did not lead to differences in outcomes compared with access to high‐intensity CBT alone. Access to guided self‐help and supported cCBT led to significant reductions in the uptake of high‐intensity CBT; this did not seem to compromise patient outcomes at 12 months. Taking a decision‐making approach, which focuses on which decision has a higher probability of being cost‐effective, rather than the statistical significance of the results, there was little evidence that supported cCBT and guided self‐help are cost‐effective at the 3‐month follow‐up compared with a waiting list. However, by the 12‐month follow‐up, data suggested a greater probability of guided self‐help being cost‐effective than a waiting list from the health‐ and social‐care perspective (60%) and the societal perspective (80%), and of supported cCBT being cost‐effective compared with a waiting list from both perspectives (70%). Qualitative interviews found that guided self‐help was more acceptable to patients than supported cCBT. Professionals acknowledged the advantages of low intensity interventions at a population level. No adverse events occurred during the trial that were deemed to be suspected or unexpected serious events. LIMITATIONS: A significant issue in the interpretation of the results concerns the high level of access to high‐intensity CBT during the waiting list period. CONCLUSIONS: Although low‐intensity interventions are not associated with clinically significant improvements in OCD symptoms, economic analysis over 12 months suggests that low‐intensity interventions are cost‐effective and may have an important role in OCD care pathways. Further research to enhance the clinical effectiveness of these interventions may be warranted, alongside research on how best to incorporate them into care pathways.

YR: 2010
KY: Pressure Ulcer; Spinal Cord Injuries; Ulcer
AB: The goal of the proposed project is to evaluate outcomes of a telehealth nursing intervention based on a social cognitive behavioral model to promote self management in pressure ulcer prevention, reduce costs and identify barriers and facilitators of using telehealth technology in the home environment. The telehealth intervention links to the Medical Home Model in the areas of providing self‐management, patient education and family involvement in the veterans' care at home. NRI research focuses on nursing interventions that are patient‐centered, culturally congruent, cost‐effective and outcome‐driven. Improving SCI care and the quality of life in veterans is a critical component of the VA mission. Veterans with SCI face many secondary complications including pressure ulcers (PU). Although PUs in SCI has been conceptualized as a mechanical alteration in skin integrity, there is ample evidence that supports the presence of a behavioral component to PU development. Based on promising results from our feasibility and validation pilot study, we propose "TELEPUPPS" (TELE pressure ulcer prevention problem solving), a program that innovatively combines two unique and complementary telehealth technologies‐‐wireless tele‐technology with camcorders and an in‐home messaging device for veterans and their informal caregivers to prevent PUs. The proposed project is a randomized, controlled multi‐site trial. The study will be conducted at the NF/SG VHS in Gainesville and Lake City, Florida and the VA Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS) in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Two hundred and thirty‐two Hispanic and non Hispanic white veterans with SCI, caregivers and the absence of a PU for at least six months will be randomly assigned to one of two study arms: (1) TELEPUPPS; or (2) telephone attention control (TAC). Both groups will receive the usual medical care provided by the VA. The TELEPUPPS participants will learn self care management of PUP through a program based on a social cognitive behavioral model to reinforce problem solving and self‐efficacy in preventing pressure ulcers. The program has been translated and validated for Puerto Rican veterans using focus groups. The TELEPUPPS participants will receive six TELEPUPPS sessions and the TAC participants will have six phone contacts every other week for three months. All participants will be assessed at baseline (T1), three months (T2), and nine months (T3). Assessments will focus on 1) the study outcomes: PU prevention (Number of PUs and stage of PU), QOL, depression, adherence to self‐management strategies for PUP, veteran and caregiver satisfaction, costs, and barriers and facilitators; (2) potential mediating variables: problem solving and self‐efficacy; and (3) covariates including demographics and socio economics: age, ethnicity, education, marital status, rural vs. urban, caregiver, income, employment/retired status and health status variables.

AB: Despite indirect evidence suggesting that chlorthalidone (CTD) is superior to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for preventing cardiovascular (CVD) events in patients with hypertension, HCTZ is far more widely used in clinical practice. The two drugs have never been compared directly in a large trial with CVD outcomes. We describe the design and early results of an NHLBI‐funded R34 pilot study to plan such a multi‐center clinical trial. The pilot study and full‐scale clinical trial adhere to pragmatic trial principles and are conducted at low cost within large health systems. The pilot study is taking place at HealthPartners (Minneapolis‐St. Paul, MN) and Kaiser Permanente Northwest (Portland, OR). Using a cluster‐randomized design, we will allocate 40 primary care providers and their eligible hypertensive patients who currently use HCTZ (N=2000) to either convert to CTD (intervention group) or to continue HCTZ (usual care group). Eligible patients are age 18 and older, have a hypertension diagnosis, use HCTZ 12.5‐50 mg as a single agent that is not part of a fixed‐dose combination (but all other antihypertensive so are permitted), and do not have hypokalemia or hyponatremia. Patients taking HCTZ 12.5‐25 mg will convert to CTD 12.5 mg, and patients taking HCTZ 50 mg will convert to CTD 25 mg. Otherwise, antihypertensive therapy will be managed by the primary care provider, including changing the patient back to HCTZ if deemed necessary. The study will use existing clinical infrastructure and electronic health records to identify eligible study patients, distribute study medication to intervention patients using methods similar to therapeutic substitution, and collect operational and outcomes data. For the pilot study, Aim 1 will document that the switch to CTD occurs as intended and measure adherence using pharmacy claims. Aim 2 will examine safety using electronic laboratory, blood pressure, and diagnosis code data. Aim 3 will refine the study design and identify critical factors for intervention success using a mixed‐methods approach that includes interviews with study physicians, patients, pharmacists, and health system stakeholders. Aims 4 and 5 will refine estimates of sample size and per‐participant costs for the full‐scale trial. The pilot study will produce data that are necessary and sufficient to inform the planning of a full‐scale trial comparing the effects of CTD and HCTZ on CVD outcomes. It will also advance the development of methods for low‐cost pragmatic trials within learning health systems.

However, achieving universal coverage, especially in poor and remote areas, has proved a particular challenge and there remains a need to explore alternative delivery mechanisms. The recent introduction of universal primary education in Kenya has meant that even the poorest households are sending at least one child to school, providing a complementary, potentially equitable, mechanism through which to distribute LLINs. The delivery of LLINs through schools will be piloted by Population Services International in schools situated along the Tana River in North Eastern Kenya. This proposal seeks to evaluate the impact of this programme on both household use of school donated, free LLINs and the health of schoolchildren. The study hypothesis is that the free delivery of long lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) through schools will increase household LLIN coverage among younger siblings not enrolled in school and will reduce rates of malaria infection and anaemia among school children. The study will be an impact evaluation of a programme delivering LLINs through schools, which is to be implemented by Population Services International (PSI)‐Kenya. The programme will be implemented in 50 schools and due to PSI‐Kenya's roll out, the programme will be phased in over two years. will be phased in over two years. The 50 schools will be randomly divided into two groups, the first 25 schools will receive LLINs in 2009 and the second group will receive them in 2010. In each school, five households will be randomly selected and household surveys will be conducted to collect information on household net use and household demographic and socio‐economic status. School health surveys will be completed at the end of the programme to assess programme impact on malaria infection and anaemia.

KY: Bipolar Disorder
AB: A 2010 HHS report highlighted the prevalence, morbidity, and cost associated with clusters of co‐occurring chronic conditions, both physical and mental. The report also underscored the lack of sustainable treatment strategies for these afflicted individuals, and the difficulties in customizing patient‐centered interventions. Collaborative chronic care models (CCMs) are effective in treating chronic medical and mental illnesses at little to no net healthcare cost. To date CCMs have primarily been implemented at the facility level and primarily developed for and adopted by larger healthcare organizations. However, we have determined that the vast majority of primary care and behavioral health practices providing commercially insured care are far too small to implement such models. Health plan‐level CCMs can address this unmet need. Chronic mood disorders (e.g., bipolar disorders, depression) are common and are associated with extensive functional impairment, medical comorbidity, and personal and societal costs. While unipolar depression is more common, bipolar disorder is more costly on a per patient basis due to its chronic and severe nature. Moreover, bipolar disorder is the most expensive mental disorder for U.S. commercial health plans and employers. While evidence‐based care parameters have been well established for mood disorders, quality of care and health outcomes in general mental health practice are suboptimal. The majority of these patients suffer from clusters of comorbid conditions, both physical and mental. Thus mood disorders represent optimal tracer conditions with which to improve management strategies for individuals with multiple chronic conditions. Accordingly, we have partnered with Aetna Inc. to develop and implement a CCM designed to improve outcomes for persons with mood disorders for solo or small practices, with an eye towards developing a business case for a generalizable plan‐level CCM for chronic disorders. We will conduct an RCT of a health plan‐level CCM vs. education control. The population of interest will be Aetna beneficiaries across the country hospitalized for depression or bipolar disorder treated in solo or small primary care or behavioral health practices. Patients will be randomized to one year of outpatient treatment augmented by the CCM or education control, for a total of 344 participants. Practices participation in the study will be limited to completion of an organizational survey. We anticipate 172 practices to complete these surveys. CCM care management will be fully remote from practice venues and patients, implemented by existing providers (the Aetna care management center). A business case will be developed using the Replicating Effective Programs (REP) strategy that identifies generalizable facilitators for CCM spread and value added of CCMs to be vetted to key industry and policy stakeholders.

DOI: 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60751-4
AB: BACKGROUND: Urinary incontinence is common immediately after prostate surgery. Men are often advised to do pelvic‐floor exercises, but evidence to support this is inconclusive. Our aim was to establish if formal one‐to‐one pelvic floor muscle training reduces incontinence. METHODS: We undertook two randomised trials in men in the UK who were incontinent 6 weeks after radical prostatectomy (trial 1) or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP; trial 2) to compare four sessions with a therapist over 3 months with standard care and lifestyle advice only. Randomisation was by remote computer allocation. Our primary endpoints, collected via postal questionnaires, were participants' reports of urinary incontinence and incremental cost per quality‐adjusted life year (QALY) after 12 months. Group assignment was masked from outcome assessors, but this masking was not possible for participants or caregivers. We used intention‐to‐treat analyses to compare the primary outcome at 12 months. This study is registered, number ISRCTN87696430. FINDINGS: In the intervention group in trial 1, the rate of urinary incontinence at 12 months (148 [76%] of 196) was not significantly different from the control group (151 [77%] of 195; absolute risk difference [RD] ‐1·9%, 95% CI ‐10 to 6). In trial 2, the difference in the rate of urinary incontinence at 12 months (126 [65%] of 194) from the control group was not significant (125 [62%] of 203; RD 3·4%, 95% CI ‐6 to 13). Adjusting for minimisation factors or doing treatment‐received analyses did not change these results in either trial. No adverse effects were reported. In both trials, the intervention resulted in higher mean costs per patient (£180 and £209 respectively) but we did not identify evidence of an economically important difference in QALYs (0·002 [95% CI ‐0·027 to 0·023] and ‐0·00003 [‐0·026 to 0·026]). INTERPRETATION: In settings where information about pelvic‐floor exercise is widely available, one‐to‐one conservative physical therapy for men who are incontinent after prostate surgery is unlikely to be effective or cost effective. The high rates of persisting incontinence after 12 months suggest a substantial unrecognised and unmet need for management in these men.

AB: Background: Obesity increases the risk of many health complications such as hypertension, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes, needs long‐lasting treatment for effective results and involves high public and private care‐costs. Therefore, it is imperative that enduring and low‐cost clinical programs for obesity and related co‐morbidities are developed and evaluated. Information and communication technologies (ICT) can help clinicians to deliver treatment in a cost‐effective and time‐saving manner to a large number of obese individuals with co‐morbidities. Objective: To examine ad interim effectiveness of a 12‐month multidisciplinary telecare intervention for weight loss provided to obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single‐center randomized controlled trial (TECNOB study) started in December 2008. At present, 72 obese patients with type 2 diabetes have been recruited and randomly allocated to the TECNOB program (n=37) or to a control condition (n=39). However, only 34 participants have completed at least the 3‐month follow‐up and have been included in this ad interim analysis. 21 out of them have reached also the 6‐month follow‐up and 13 have achieved the end of the program. Study is still on‐going. Intervention: All participants attended 1‐month inpatient intensive program that involved individualized medical care, diet therapy, physical training and brief psychological counseling. At discharge, participants allocated to the TECNOB program were instructed to use a weight‐loss web‐site, a web‐based videoconference tool, a dietary software installed into their cellular phones and an electronic armband measuring daily steps and energy expenditure. Main Outcome Measures: Weight and disordered eating‐related behaviors and cognitions (EDI‐2) at entry to hospital, at discharge from hospital, at 3,6 and 12 months. Results: Ad interim analysis of data from 34 participants showed no statistically significant difference between groups in weight change at any time‐point. However, within‐group analysis revealed significant reductions of initial weight at discharge from hospital, at 3 months, at 6 months but not at 12 months. Control group had higher scores in Interpersonal distrust at 12 months. Conclusion: This ad interim findings revealed that the effect of the inpatient treatment was high and probably overwhelmed the effect of the TECNOB intervention. Much statistical power and long‐term follow‐up may enhance the probability to detect the TECNOB effect over and above the great one exerted by the inpatient program. © Castelnuovo et al.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Older patients discharged from the emergency department (ED) have difficulty comprehending discharge plans and are at high risk of adverse outcomes. The authors investigated whether a postdischarge telephone call‐mediated intervention by a nurse would improve discharge care plan adherence, specifically by expediting post‐ED visit physician follow‐up appointments and/or compliance with medication changes. The second objectives were to determine if this telephone call intervention would reduce return ED visits and/or hospitalizations within 35 days of the index ED visit and to determine potential cost savings of this intervention. METHODS: This was a 10‐week randomized, controlled trial among patients aged 65 and older discharged to home from an academic ED. At 1 to 3 days after each patient's index ED visit, a trained nurse called intervention group patients to review discharge instructions and assist with discharge plan compliance; placebo call group patients received a patient satisfaction survey call, while the control group patients were not called. Data collection calls occurred at 5 to 8 days and 30 to 35 days after the index ED visits for all three groups. Chi‐square or Fisher's exact tests were performed for categorical data and the Kruskal‐Wallis test examined group differences in time to follow‐up. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients completed the study. Patients were 60% female and 72% white, with a mean age of 75 years (standard deviation [SD] ± 7.58 years). Intervention patients were more likely to follow up with medical providers within 5 days of their ED visits than either the placebo or the control group patients (54, 20, and 37%, respectively; p = 0.04). All groups performed well in medication acquisition and comprehension of medication indications and dosage. There were no differences in return visits to the ED or hospital within 35 days of the index ED visit for intervention patients, compared to placebo or control group patients (22, 33, and 27%, respectively; p = 0.41). An economic analysis showed an estimated 70% chance that this intervention would reduce total costs. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone call follow‐up of older patients discharged from the ED resulted in expedited follow‐up for patients with their primary care physicians. Further study is warranted to determine if these results translate into improved patient outcomes, decreased return ED visits or hospital admissions, and cost savings resulting from this intervention.

AB: Objectives To investigate the impact of cardiologist‐coordinated intensive follow‐up on the long‐term prognosis of percutaneous coronary intervention in Chinese patients. Methods We recruited 964 patients who had acute coronary syndrome and underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention in the First Hospital Affiliated to Henan University of Science and Technology, China. Participants were randomly assigned into the intensive follow‐up (n = 479) and usual follow‐up group (control group, n = 485). They received secondary prevention education during hospitalization and telephone follow‐ups after discharge. The control group received telephone calls from nurses, while the intensive follow‐up group received telephone calls and medical consultations from cardiologists. Both groups were followed up for 36 months. Results (1) At 36 months, the proportions of all‐cause death, cardiac death and cumulative major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were 5.3%, 4.4% and 18.6% in the intensive follow‐up group. These events were significantly lower than in the control group (10.1%, 9.3 % and 28.8% (p = 0.004, p = 0.003 and p < 0.001). (2) Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified intensive follow‐up as an independent predictor of survival, cardiac death‐free survival and MACE‐free survival. (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.487, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.298‐0.797, p = 0.004; HR = 0.466, 95% CI 0.274‐0.793, p = 0.005; HR = 0.614, 95% CI 0.464‐0.811, p = 0.001). Kaplan‐Meier analysis revealed that patients in the intensive follow‐up groups had longer survival (log rank = 8.565, p = 0.003), cardiac death‐free survival (log rank = 8.769, p = 0.003) and MACE‐free survival (log rank = 15.928, p < 0.001). (3) The average medical cost was significantly less in the intensive follow‐up group, especially the cost for re‐hospitalization (US$582.74 +/‐ 1753.20 vs. US$999.32 +/‐ 2434.57, p = 0.003). The bleeding events were similar. (4) Patients in the intensive follow‐up group had significantly better controls of cardiovascular risk factors and medication adherence. Conclusions A cardiologist‐coordinated intensive follow‐up program markedly decreased cardiovascular risk factors, reduced medical costs, promoted medication adherence and improved the long‐term prognosis of patients after percutaneous coronary intervention in the Chinese population.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Few hospitals treat patients' tobacco dependence. To be effective, hospital‐initiated cessation interventions must provide at least 1 month of supportive contact post‐discharge. STUDY DESIGN: Individually randomized clinical trial. Recruitment commenced July 2011; analyses were conducted October 2014‐June 2015. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted in two large Midwestern hospitals. Participants included smokers who were aged >/=18 years, planned to stay quit after discharge, and spoke English or Spanish. INTERVENTION: Hospital‐based cessation counselors delivered the intervention. For patients randomized to warm handoff, staff immediately called the quitline from the bedside and handed the phone to participants for enrollment and counseling. Participants randomized to fax were referred on the day of hospital discharge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes at 6 months included quitline enrollment/adherence, medication use, biochemically verified cessation, and cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Significantly more warm handoff than fax participants enrolled in quitline (99.6% vs 59.6%; relative risk, 1.67; 95% CI=1.65, 1.68). One in four (25.4% warm handoff, 25.3% fax) were verified to be abstinent at 6‐month follow‐up; this did not differ significantly between groups (relative risk, 1.02; 95% CI=0.82, 1.24). Cessation medication use in the hospital and receipt of a prescription for medication at discharge did not differ between groups; however, significantly more fax participants reported using cessation medication post‐discharge (32% vs 25%, p=0.01). The average incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio of enrolling participants into warm handoff was $0.14. Hospital‐borne costs were significantly lower in warm handoff than in fax ($5.77 vs $9.41, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: One in four inpatient smokers referred to quitline by either method were abstinent at 6 months post‐discharge. Among motivated smokers, fax referral and warm handoff are efficient and comparatively effective ways to link smokers with evidence‐based care. For hospitals, warm handoff is a less expensive and more effective method for enrolling smokers in quitline services.

AB: Aural rehabilitation The most common approach to hearing impairment is hearing aid fitting as a part of aural rehabilitation (AR). In Sweden, approximately 50% of those who could benefit from hearing aids are fitted with them, and nearly half of those use their hearing aids to a considerable extent every day. Despite addressing the hearing impairment with hearing aids, many hearing aid users experience substantial communication difficulties that can affect their performance in daily life situations. This could cause patients to stop using their hearing aids, which may negatively affect their interpersonal interactions and involvement in community life. Adjusting to hearing impairment involves more than just hearing aid fitting, although hearing aid fitting is a step in the right direction. Additional steps within AR, such as learning about the condition and providing perceptual training and counseling, need to be included in order to minimize the negative effects of a hearing impairment on social interactions and quality of life. These additional steps can effectively be included variously throughout the AR (separately or in combination, and individually or in groups), they may increase hearing aid use and satisfaction, and can be performed as an adjunct to or a supplement for hearing aid fitting. However, even though combining these additional steps with hearing aid use has proven to be beneficial, most hearing aid users are unaware of and are not offered any other rehabilitation measures than hearing aid fitting. This deficiency could be due to clinicians experiencing lack of time and difficulties scheduling interventions in addition to hearing aid fitting. It could also be due to the presumably increased costs of adding extra support to hearing aid fitting. These aspects could hinder audiologist's in general clinical practice from providing holistic care. Thus, the overall availability of comprehensive AR is low. Internet interventions Online interventions and healthcare information is cost‐effective. Online hearing healthcare has increased in recent years and is empowering for persons with hearing impairment. Telehealth (i.e., telephone and internet) offers a more cost‐effective approach to hearing healthcare and increases the possibilities for the audiologist to reach out to persons with hearing impairment. Previous research has proposed employing telehealth in hearing healthcare to improve clinical care and increase access to hearing services. Effective internet interventions have four important interactive design features: 1) social context and support, 2) contacts with intervention, 3) tailoring, and 4) self‐management. Patient participation is central for self‐management to be successful. For example, a person with hearing impairment can apply knowledge obtained in communication training to reduce hearing‐related problems. The role of the audiologist in delivering social contact and support, and contacts with the intervention, seems to be of particular importance in online audiology interventions. Purpose With this project we want to provide online support to hearing aid users. Further on, we want to document the effectiveness of the online support compared to traditional support that the Hearing Organization, VGR, provides ("standard care"). The needs‐oriented purpose: The project is a part of a collaboration between 1177 Care‐Guide and region Vastra Gotaland (VGR). 1177 Care‐Guide is a national website of health information and services for Sweden. Every region customizes its 1177 Care‐Guide. Regions use the 1177 Care‐Guide platform to provide online services. The needs‐oriented purpose of this project is to, via 1177, provide needed online support to hearing aid users. The research‐oriented purpose of this project is to document the effectiveness of the online support compared to traditional support that the Hearing Organization, VGR, provides ("standard care"). Traditional support ("standard care") in Sweden differs across and within counties, in particular in terms of the number of visits and the content of comprehensive AR. The costs of amplification for the person with hearing impairment may also vary across counties.

AB: The use of drugs in the elderly population remains a major public health problem worldwide. Technological advances and the development of new drugs have helped to extend life expectancy. However, the complex process of aging, resulting in changes in physiological functions, may affect the pharmacodynamics / kinetics of medications taken by the elderly. In addition, polypharmacy, due to multiple comorbidities, may also lead to an increased risk of drug or field interaction and the use of potentially inappropriate drugs (PID), increasing the risk of drug iatrogenic use in older users. With a view to optimizing drug prescriptions and preventing drug iatrogenic disease in the elderly, and in the context of a university‐based research and teaching approach, the AP‐HM pharmacy initiated , in collaboration with certain clinical departments, the setting up of clinical pharmacy activities for patients at high iatrogenic risk. These activities were established and formalized in close collaboration with the doctors of the departments concerned, the geriatrics center and the geriatric mobile teams in particular, and were the subject of specific funding within the framework of the Instruction N ° DGOS / PF2 / 2016/49 of the 19/02/2016 relating to the call for project of implementation of the clinical pharmacy in health facility. The contribution of clinical pharmacists to mobile geriatric teams (intra‐hospital and outpatient), who carry out more than 2,200 geriatric assessments / year, is a way to optimize the efficiency of the medication management of the elderly person hospitalized out of hospital. geriatric service and EHPAD. In order to promote the physician‐pharmacist action synergy observed in practice, we decided to integrate the pharmaceutical evaluation (medication review) with the geriatric evaluation. This new cooperation makes it possible to improve the knowledge of the treatments taken by the patients, to raise awareness on the observance of the treatments and to facilitate the administration of the drugs (choice of the adapted galenic forms), to reduce the risks of iatrogenic medicinal increase the acceptance of therapeutic interventions by the health care team (attending physician, coordinator, nurse). Indeed, the first results show that the mobile team's medico‐pharmaceutical interventions have a much higher acceptance rate than medical or pharmaceutical interventions alone. However, the economic context and the human resources allocated do not make it possible to ensure an efficient service throughout the territory and in particular in nursing homes outside the city where the CHU (Marseille) is located. In order to increase the number of evaluations, we propose to develop a tele‐expertise of a medico‐pharmaceutical hospital team (EHMP) and evaluate the impact for patients residing in nursing homes in the context of a high‐level study.

Central to this process will be the utilisation of Medtech 32, a modular practice management software. Medtech has a secure internet health portal (VitelMed) that enables individuals to upload daily clinical information, to allow them to engage electronically with the nurse to support self‐management and more focussed patient care. The study’s nurse will review patients’ online records on a weekly basis and alerts will be set up on the system to highlight when a patient’s data suggests clinical changes and the requirement for the patient to seek medical advice. Patients without internet access will not be excluded from the study. They will be able to engage a family member to upload their clinical information, or will be provided with a diary to record clinical information that can be posted to the study’s Project Officer who will upload information on their behalf. To support the telehealth intervention participants will receive CHF education and have a telehealth heart failure management plan developed during an initial face to face appointment (2 hours) with the project’s CHF nurse. If a face to face appointment is not possible a telephone conference will be arranged. Participants will be provided with a computer tablet and three devices that monitor their health; scales, a blood pressure monitor and physical activity monitor and will be orientated to this equipment and software at the initial appointment. These devices stream data automatically to the computer tablet which then gets uploaded to VitelMed, so that it can be accessed remotely by the study’s nurse. Participants will be phoned once a week (15 minutes) for the first month to provide support for ongoing self‐management and using the telehealth devices. Participants’ will also enter their self‐management observations into the self‐management database through a secure online portal for ongoing review by the project’s nurse. The nurse will undertake surveillance of participant’s recorded details and use these to guide self‐management and link the participant to their GP/Cardiologist in the event of clinical deterioration. CONDITION: Chronic Heart Failure Self‐care behaviour PRIMARY OUTCOME: Clinical Outcomes through access to Department of Health records held by the Data Linkage Unit (mortality and readmissions). ; Quality of life is assessed using Minesotta Living with Heart Faillure Questionnaire and Short Form 12 self‐care behaviour is assessed using Self‐Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) SECONDARY OUTCOME: Cost effectiveness will involve three tasks: ; 1. Measuring and valuing the health system costs of implementing each intervention. ; 2. Measuring and valuing the health system and associated costs of treating patients in each arm of the study for the 6‐month study period following hospital discharge. ; 3. Calculating the total costs of each arm of the study ; Perceptions of nurse‐supported telehealth amongst patients with CHF through Nurse‐supported telehealth for people with heart conditions questionnaire which is designed specifically for this study INCLUSION CRITERIA: prior hospital admission with a primary or secondary diagnosis of CHF

AB: BACKGROUND: Psychological distress is prevalent in haemodialysis (HD) patients yet access to psychotherapy remains limited. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of online cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT) tailored for HD patients, with or without therapist support, for managing psychological distress. METHODS: This feasibility randomised controlled trial recruited patients from a UK HD centre. Following psychological distress screens, patients with mild‐moderate psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ‐9; score: 5‐19 and/or Generalised Anxiety Disorder; GAD‐7 score: 5‐14) who met remaining inclusion criteria were approached for consent. Consenters were individually randomised (1:1) to online‐CBT or online‐CBT plus three therapist support calls. Outcomes included recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. Exploratory change analyses were performed for: psychological distress, quality of life (QoL), illness perceptions, and costs. The statistician was blinded to allocation. RESULTS: 182 (44%) out of 410 patients approached completed psychological distress screens. 26% found screening unacceptable; a further 30% found it unfeasible. Psychological distress was detected in 101 (55%) patients, 60 of these met remaining inclusion criteria. The primary reason for ineligibility was poor computer literacy (N=17, 53%). Twenty‐five patients were randomised to the supported (N=18) or unsupported arm (N=7); 92% were retained at follow‐up. No differences in psychological distress or cost‐effectiveness were observed. No trial adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: Online CBT appears feasible but only for computer literate patients who identify with the label psychological distress. A definitive trial using the current methods for psychological distress screening and online care delivery is unfeasible. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02352870.

AB: AIMS: The growing incidence of diabetes and the need to contain healthcare costs empower the necessity to identify new models of care. Telemedicine offers an acknowledged instrument to provide clinical health care at a distance, increasing patient compliance and the achievement of therapeutical goals. The objective was to test the feasibility and the efficacy in the improvement of the glycemic control of the teleconsultation for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: A randomized open‐label, parallel arms, controlled trial was conducted in two diabetes centers in Italy. Participants affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus have been randomly (1:1) assigned to receive their visits as standard or a web‐based care. Patients in the teleconsultation group can arrange their appointments on a Web site and can also have access to web educational courses or to nutritional and psychological counseling. The primary outcome was the assessment of glycemic control by HbA1c measurement after a 12‐month follow‐up. RESULTS: Overall 74 participants were followed for 1 year. HbA1c changes were not statistically different within (p = 0.56 for standard care group; p = 0.45 for telemedicine group) and between (p = 0.60) groups when considering differences from baseline to the end of the study. Patients randomized to teleconsultation reported reduced severe hypoglycemic episodes (p = 0.03). In addition, they were largely satisfied with the activities, perceived a good improvement in the self‐management of the diabetes, and reported to have a time saving and a cost reduction. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, TELEDIABE proposes a new system for the management of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

AB: Disablement affects over 40% of patients with advanced stage cancer, devastates their quality of life (QoL), and increases their healthcare costs. Proactively treating the causes of disablement; physical impairments, pain, and immobility, can prolong functional independence, improve QoL and, potentially, reduce utilization. However rehabilitation service delivery models are reactive in nature and focus on catastrophic rather than incipient disability. A validated collaborative approach, the Three Component Model (TCM), optimizes important clinical outcomes and may provide an ideal framework to overcome barriers to proactively integrating rehabilitation into cancer care. A novel expansion of the TCM that targets disablement by engaging local physical therapists to address physical impairments and immobility, the TCM‐Rehabilitation Services (TCM‐RS), benefits and is well received by patients. However, its effectiveness has not been rigorously assessed. The 3‐arm randomized COllaborative Care to Preserve PErformance in Cancer (COPE) Trial compared: 1) enhanced usual care, 2) rehabilitation services targeting physical impairments and immobility via the TCM‐RS, and 3) TCM‐RS plus conventional TCM pain management TCM‐RS+Pain. Of the 516 participants, those randomized to arms 2 and 3 underwent an initial 4‐week intervention period and were then followed for 6months with remote monitoring and monthly telephone calls. The trial's primary outcome, functional status, and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3, and 6months. Utilization was abstracted from clinical records. By estimating the effectiveness and cost‐utility implications of the TCM‐RS and TCM‐RS+Pain, COPE will inform future delivery research, practice and policy in the means to reduce disablement in chronically diseased populations.

AB: Objective: Following a hip fracture, most patients do not return to pre‐fracture autonomy level. e‐Health solutions incorporated within homecare rehabilitation may lead to better outcomes and reduce cost to the healthcare system. Our objective is to enable recovery and improve quality of life following a hip fracture through the development and implementation of the HIP Mobile e‐ Monitoring and Coaching system. Methods: Our interdisciplinary team partnered with Greybox Solutions for the development of the HIP Mobile technology. A trial was initiated to determine if this technology is more effective at improving mobility in adults 60 years and older with a recent hip fracture than a printed material support program. Results: HIP Mobile is an e‐Monitoring and Coaching support program, comprised of a wearable sensor‐ a smart insole for the shoe‐ with a tablet based app interface and a secure cloud based remote monitoring dashboard. Expert educational content (user guides, 6‐level exercise program to be followed at home, and post‐intervention exercise program), exercise‐tracking algorithms and a patient‐oriented interface have been piloted, validated and formatted for the electronic and printed versions and translated in French. Recruitment is ongoing for a randomized clinical trial with parallel groups with the primary outcome of functional mobility (as measured by gait speed and 30‐second sit‐to‐stand activity) 6 months following hip fracture. Patient‐reported outcomes and place of residence have been collected throughout the trial and persistence of effect will be determined at 12 months. Conclusion: Our interactive HIP Mobile e‐system encourages active engagement in the rehabilitation process following a hip fracture and has the potential to improve functional mobility and autonomy at reduced costs. If successful, such technology could be harnessed towards a variety of rehabilitation processes.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Measure the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of using sensor data from an environmentally embedded sensor system for early illness recognition. This sensor system has demonstrated in pilot studies to detect changes in function and in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self‐reports of illness. DESIGN: Prospective intervention study in 13 assisted living (AL) communities of 171 residents randomly assigned to intervention (n=86) or comparison group (n=85) receiving usual care. METHODS: Intervention participants lived with the sensor system an average of one year. MEASUREMENTS: Continuous data collected 24 hours/7 days a week from motion sensors to measure overall activity, an under mattress bed sensor to capture respiration, pulse, and restlessness as people sleep, and a gait sensor that continuously measures gait speed, stride length and time, and automatically assess for increasing fall risk as the person walks around the apartment. Continuously running computer algorithms are applied to the sensor data and send health alerts to staff when there are changes in sensor data patterns. RESULTS: The randomized comparison group functionally declined more rapidly than the intervention group. Walking speed and several measures from GaitRite, velocity, step length left and right, stride length left and right, and the fall risk measure of functional ambulation profile (FAP) all had clinically significant changes. The walking speed increase (worse) and velocity decline (worse) of 0.073 m/s for comparison group exceeded 0.05 m/s, a value considered to be a minimum clinically important difference. No differences were measured in health care costs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that sensor data with health alerts and fall alerts sent to AL nursing staff can be an effective strategy to detect and intervene in early signs of illness or functional decline.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Remote monitoring is increasingly becoming the new standard of care for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) follow‐up. We sought to determine whether remote monitoring of ICDs improves patient outcomes compared with quarterly device interrogations in clinic. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this single‐center pilot clinical trial, adult patients with an ICD were randomly assigned to remote monitoring versus quarterly device interrogations in clinic. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular hospitalization, emergency room visit for a cardiac cause, and unscheduled visit to the electrophysiology clinic for a device‐related issue at 1 year. We also examined health‐related quality of life, costs, and patient satisfaction with their ICD care. Of 151 patients enrolled in this trial, 76 were randomized to remote monitoring and 75 to quarterly device interrogations in clinic. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint (32% in the remote monitoring arm vs 34% in the control arm; P = 0.8), mortality, or cost between the 2 arms. Quality of life and patient satisfaction were significantly better in the control arm than in the remote monitoring arm at 6 months (83 [25th, 75th percentiles 70, 90] vs 75 [50, 85]; P = 0.002 and 88 [75, 100] vs 75 [75, 88]; P = 0.03, respectively), but not at 12 months. CONCLUSION: We showed no significant reduction in cardiac‐related resource utilization with remote monitoring of ICDs. However, given the small number of patients in our study, the real clinical and health economics impact of remote monitoring needs to be verified by a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of an automated interactive voice response system (IVR) and Specialist Nurse Support to reduce health care utilization and improve health‐related quality of life in children with asthma. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial in 121 children with doctor‐diagnosed asthma and an acute presentation with asthma in the previous 12 months aged between 3 and 16 years. Children were randomized to one of three groups for a 6‐month intervention receiving asthma education and management support from a Specialist Nurse by telephone or e‐mail (N = 41), from IVR (N = 39), or receiving usual care (control group; N = 41). Outcomes included health care utilization and use of oral steroid rescue. Health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) data using the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory were collected at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant benefit identified for either the IVR or the Nurse Support interventions for health care utilization, use of oral steroid rescue, or HRQOL compared with controls. Relative to controls, the incremental costs were ‐A$225.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: ‐A$840, A$391) per child for the Nurse Support intervention and ‐A$451.45 (‐A$1075, A$173) per child for IVR. The results were most sensitive to the frequency of admissions to hospital. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that both IVR and Nurse Support interventions may be cost‐saving from a health system perspective, with IVR providing the greatest benefit and this pilot study provides a strong basis for developing larger trials with longer follow‐up.

AB: Background: Neglect of self‐care in the patient with diabetes causes a significant worsening in physical and mental functioning and increased healthcare costs. One of the objectives of incorporating telemedicine is to improve motivation and patient adherence. This study aims to analyze the effect of a telecare (TC) program in treatment adherence in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and treated with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion treatment (CSII). Methods: 36 patients with T1DM and CSII treatment were included in a cross‐over randomized clinical trial during 18 months. Participants were randomly assigned to receive TC (Group1) program or conventional care (CC) (Group2) during 6 months and after a 3 months changed to CC (Group1) or to TC (Group2) respectively, and were followed during 6 months. TC program included monthly virtual visits using an Internet platform. CC comprised face‐to‐face visits every three months. Adherence was measured through an adherence scale, validated by our research group. Results: 36 patients were included. Five subjects dropped out during the first 3 months. At the 6 months of the study, there is an increased adherence to treatment in both groups: Group1 ( p < 0.001) and Group2 ( p < 0.001). At 18 months, when both groups have been with TC, there is a significant improvement in adherence with respect to the basal score (Group1: p < 0.001; Group2: p = 0.008). Conclusions: The results suggest that TC is so good tool as CC for improving adherence to treatment of patients with T1DM. It would be necessary to conduct a cost‐effectiveness analysis to support telemedicine programs.

AB: BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have provided unequivocal evidence that treatment of hypertension decreases mortality and major disability from cardiovascular disease; however, blood pressure remains inadequately treated in most affected individuals. This large gap continues despite the facts that more than 90% of adults with hypertension have health insurance, and hypertension is the leading cause of visits to the doctor. New approaches are needed to improve hypertension care. OBJECTIVES: The Electronic Communications and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (e‐BP) study is a three‐arm randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether care based on the Chronic Care Model and delivered over the Internet improves hypertension care. The primary study outcomes are systolic, diastolic, and blood pressure control; secondary outcomes are medication adherence, patient self‐efficacy, satisfaction and quality of life, and healthcare utilization and costs. METHODS: Hypertensive patients receiving care at Group Health medical centers are eligible if they have uncontrolled blood pressure on two screening visits and access to the Web and an e‐mail address. Study participants are randomly assigned to three intervention groups: (a) usual care; (b) home blood pressure monitoring receipt and proficiency training on its use and the Group Health secure patient website (with secure e‐mail access to their healthcare provider, access to a shared medical record, prescription refill and other services); or (c) this plus pharmacist care management (collaborative care management between the patient, the pharmacist, and the patient's physician via a secure patient website and the electronic medical record). CONCLUSION: We will determine whether a new model of patient‐centered care that leverages Web communications, self‐monitoring, and collaborative care management improves hypertension control. If this model proves successful and cost‐effective, similar interventions could be used to improve the care of large numbers of patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

AB: BACKGROUND: Obesity is one of the most important medical and public health problems of our time: it increases the risk of many health complications such as hypertension, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes, needs long‐lasting treatment for effective results and involves high public and private costs. Therefore, it is imperative that enduring and low‐cost clinical programs for obesity and related co‐morbidities are developed and evaluated. METHODS/DESIGN: TECNOB (TEChnology for OBesity) is a comprehensive two‐phase stepped down program enhanced by telemedicine for the long‐term treatment of obese people with type 2 diabetes seeking intervention for weight loss. Its core features are the hospital‐based intensive treatment (1‐month), that consists of diet therapy, physical training and psychological counseling, and the continuity of care at home using new information and communication technologies (ICT) such as internet and mobile phones. The effectiveness of the TECNOB program compared with usual care (hospital‐based treatment only) will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 12‐month follow‐up. The primary outcome is weight in kilograms. Secondary outcome measures are energy expenditure measured using an electronic armband, glycated hemoglobin, binge eating, self‐efficacy in eating and weight control, body satisfaction, healthy habit formation, disordered eating‐related behaviors and cognitions, psychopathological symptoms and weight‐related quality of life. Furthermore, the study will explore what behavioral and psychological variables are predictive of treatment success among those we have considered. DISCUSSION: The TECNOB study aims to inform the evidence‐based knowledge of how telemedicine may enhance the effectiveness of clinical interventions for weight loss and related type‐2 diabetes, and which type of obese patients may benefit the most from such interventions. Broadly, the study aims also to have a effect on the theoretical model behind the traditional health care service, in favor of a change towards a new "health care everywhere" approach.

AB: BACKGROUND: The natural history of ulcerative colitis requires continuous monitoring of medical treatment via frequent outpatient visits. The European health authorities' focus on e‐health is increasing. Lack of easy access to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinics, patients' education and understanding of the importance of early treatment at relapse is leading to poor compliance. To overcome these limitations a randomised control trial 'Constant‐care' was undertaken in Denmark and Ireland. METHODS: 333 patients with mild/moderate ulcerative colitis and 5‐aminosalicylate acid treatment were randomised to either a web‐group receiving disease specific education and self‐treatment via http://www.constant‐care.dk or a control group continuing the usual care for 12 months. A historical control group was included to test the comparability with the control group. We investigated: feasibility of the approach, its influence on patients' compliance, knowledge, quality of life (QoL), disease outcomes, safety and health care costs. RESULTS: 88% of the web patients preferred using the new approach. Adherence to 4 weeks of acute treatment was increased by 31% in Denmark and 44% in Ireland compared to the control groups. In Denmark IBD knowledge and QoL were significantly improved in web patients. Median relapse duration was 18 days (95% CI 10 to 21) in the web versus 77 days (95% CI 46 to 108) in the control group. The number of acute and routine visits to the outpatient clinic was lower in the web than in the control group, resulting in a saving of 189 euro/patient/year. No difference in the relapse frequency, hospitalisation, surgery or adverse events was observed. The historical control group was comparable with the control group. CONCLUSION: The new web‐guided approach on http://www.constant‐care.dk is feasible, safe and cost effective. It empowers patients with ulcerative colitis without increasing their morbidity and depression. It has yet to be shown whether this strategy can change the natural disease course of ulcerative colitis in the long term.

AB: Aims: The growing incidence of diabetes and the need to contain healthcare costs empower the necessity to identify new models of care.Telemedicine offers an acknowledged instrument to provide clinical health care at a distance, increasing patient compliance and the achievement of therapeutical goals. The objective was to test the feasibility and the efficacy in the improvement of the glycemic control of the teleconsultation for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Methods: A randomized open‐label, parallel arms, controlled trial was conducted in two diabetes centers in Italy. Participants affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus have been randomly (1:1) assigned to receive their visits as standard or a web‐based care. Patients in the teleconsultation group can arrange their appointments on a Web site and can also have access to web educational courses or to nutritional and psychological counseling. The primary outcome was the assessment of glycemic control by HbA1c measurement after a 12‐month follow‐up. Results: Overall 74 participants were followed for 1 year. HbA1c changes were not statistically different within (p = 0.56 for standard care group; p = 0.45 for telemedicine group) and between (p = 0.60) groups when considering differences from baseline to the end of the study. Patients randomized to teleconsultation reported reduced severe hypoglycemic episodes (p = 0.03). In addition, they were largely satisfied with the activities, perceived a good improvement in the self‐management of the diabetes, and reported to have a time saving and a cost reduction. Conclusions: In conclusion, TELEDIABE proposes a new system for the management of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Copyright © 2017 Springer‐Verlag Italia S.r.l., part of Springer Nature

AB: Background: A comparative effectiveness intervention by this team improved initial fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) rates from 3% to 53% among community clinic patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and costs associated with a literacy‐informed intervention on repeat FOBT testing. Methods: Between 2008 and 2011, a three‐arm quasi‐experiential comparative effectiveness evaluation was conducted in eight community clinics in Louisiana. Clinics were randomly assigned to receive: enhanced care, a screening recommendation, and FOBT kit annually; a brief educational intervention where patients additionally received a literacy appropriate pamphlet and simplified FOBT instructions; or nurse support where a nurse manager provided the education and followed up with phone support. In year 2, all materials were mailed. The study consisted of 461 patients, ages 50 to 85 years, with a negative initial FOBT. Results: Repeat FOBT rates were 38% enhanced care, 33% education, and 59% with nurse support (P = 0.017). After adjusting for age, race, gender, and literacy, patients receiving nurse support were 1.46 times more likely to complete repeat FOBT screening than those receiving education [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.14‐1.06; P=0.002] and 1.45 times more likely than those in enhanced care but this was not significant (95% CI, 0.93‐2.26; P = 0.10). The incremental cost per additional person screened was $2,450 for nurse over enhanced care. Conclusion: A mailed pamphlet and FOBT with simplified instructions did not improve annual screening. Impact: Telephone outreach by a nurse manager was effective in improving rates of repeat FOBT, yet this may be too costly for community clinics.

AB: Objective: Second opinion is acommon phenomenon in many health systems, especially in the care of patients with cancer. However, it is not clear whether second opinion seeking should be promoted or discouraged and how second opinion services and policies can be better formalized to maximize the benefits and minimize the disadvantages. Methods: A nationwide survey was conducted with a representative sample of 678 physicians involved in cancer care (75.5% participation rate) recruited in 13 cancer centres. Results: Most physicians involved with cancer care perceived patients' second opinion seeking as a legitimate right (96.0%) and they acknowledged the need for second opinion services under certain conditions (98.2%). Many believed that second opinions can enhance patient satisfaction (77.3%) and quality of care (74.3%), but they also had concerns about increase in healthcare and societal costs (91.3%) and concentration in a high‐volume centre (90.7%). While the majority agreed with the involvement of the first opinion physicians in the second opinion services (69.5%), there were mixed opinions regarding the desirability of remote (teleconsultation) second opinion services (49.0%) and coverage by national health insurance (51.9%). Conclusion: Physicians were generally positive to second opinion services and expected positive consequences in terms of patient satisfaction and quality of care. However, they had concerns about the consequences regarding cost and equity, and disagreements were observed regarding the way to improve second opinion services. The physicians' opinions revealed in our study will be helpful in developing clearer guidelines used to maximize the benefits of second opinion services.

AB: BACKGROUND: Physical activity exerts cancer‐protective effects, yet most Americans are inactive, especially in the South, where cancer incidence rates are generally higher. Telephone‐based approaches can help overcome physical activity intervention barriers in this region (literacy, costs, lack of transportation/technology, distance from facilities) and can be automated via interactive voice response (IVR) systems for improved reach and cost‐effectiveness. AIMS: To evaluate the Deep South IVR‐supported Active Lifestyle (DIAL) intervention. METHOD(S): A pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted among 63 underactive adults in Birmingham, Alabama, from 2015 to 2017. RESULT(S): Retention was 88.9% at 12 weeks, and >=75% adherence (IVR contact on at least 63 out of 84 days) was noted among 62.5% of intervention participants. Intervention participants reported larger increases in self‐reported minutes of moderate‐to‐vigorous intensity physical activity from baseline to 12 weeks than the wait‐list control arm (median change = 47.5 vs. 5.0 minutes, respectively, p = .09). Moreover, the intervention produced significantly greater increases in physical activity self‐regulation ( p < .001) and social support from family ( p = .001) and friends ( p = .009) from baseline to 12 weeks, compared with the wait‐list control. Significant decreases in self‐reported sleep disturbance also were found in the intervention arm but not among the controls, p < .05. Overall, intervention participants reported being satisfied with the DIAL program (71.4%) and would recommend it to friends (92.9%). DISCUSSION: Findings support the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the DIAL intervention. CONCLUSION(S): Next steps include intervention refinement in preparation for a fully powered efficacy trial and eventual dissemination to rural counties.

AB: Background: Regular medical contact is important for optimizing diabetes control. However, increasing case load and limited resources requires consideration of alternative models of care. Objective and hypotheses: Our primary objective was to compare medical outcomes of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using an alternative model of care with those using a conventional model of care. We hypothesized that the medical outcomes would be similar. Methods: We conducted a randomized control trial comparing standard care with an alternative model that replaced some face‐to‐face visits with fax or internet and phone contact. Both groups had regular in‐person multidisciplinary visits at 0, 6 and 12 months. The conventional group had a physician only visit at 3 and 9 months while the intervention group had virtual visits involving communication by fax or by internet, followed by a diabetes educator phone contact. Subjects with T1D were recruited from a pediatric diabetes clinic. Data on medical outcomes (A1C, frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hypoglycemia, hospitalization and emergency room (ER) visits), time and costs associated with visits and satisfaction with care were collected. Results: 77 subjects (34 boys and 43 girls, average age 11.5 +/‐ 3.5 yr), were randomized to conventional (CON, n=37) or intervention (INT, n=40) groups. At baseline, no significant differences emerged between groups for gender, age, age at diagnosis, insulin regimen or A1C. Over the 1 yr study period, no difference was found between groups for A1C (CON 8.5 +/‐ 1.1 vs INT 8.3 +/‐ 1.2), severe hypoglycemia episodes (CON 16 vs INT 7), DKA (CON 1 vs INT 5), visits to ER (CON 4 vs INT 7), or hospital admissions (CON 0 vs INT 5). Satisfaction with diabetes care was also similar between the two groups and did not change over time. Conclusions: Using telehealth tools to replace traditional face to face visits does not negatively impact medical outcomes of children with type 1 diabetes. Further, it may lead to time and cost savings for the child and his family.

AB: Background: Lifestyle interventions are not considered to have sustained therapeutic effect on HbA1c and weight for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Remote digital coaching in the setting of connected health devices offers the possibility of timely support for behavior modification in this population. The intensity of coaching support needed to achieve positive results is unknown. We evaluated the impact of a digital lifestyle coaching program (Restore Health, Palo Alto, CA) administered at three intensity levels for T2D members of the Livongo Diabetes program. Methods: Livongo offers patients (1) a cellular‐enabled, two‐way messaging device that measures blood glucose (BG), (2) free unlimited blood glucose test strips; and (3) access to certified diabetes educators for support and goal setting. We evaluated the incremental effects of adding lifestyle coaching focused on nutrition, exercise, sleep and stress on mean BG, estimated HbA1c and weight. Eligible adults with T2D, HbA1c > 7.5%, and BMI > 25 were randomized to receive a connected scale plus (1) nothing (n=113), (2) lightweight coaching (n=72) or (3) full‐intensity coaching (n=67) for 12 weeks. Change in outcomes were evaluated using ANOVA. Results: Livongo participation resulted in significantly improved BG control (mean HbA1c declined from 8.5% to 7.5%, p=0.01). Mean weight loss and BG decrease were significantly higher in the full‐intensity vs. lightweight and scale‐only groups (mean weight change (lbs): ‐6.4,‐4.1, ‐1.1 respectively, p=0.01; mean BG change (mg/dL): ‐19.4, ‐11.3,‐2.9, p = 0.02, respectively). Costs of full‐intensity coaching were 7.2 times greater than lightweight coaching. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the Livongo program can significantly improve BG control in people with T2D and intensive digital lifestyle coaching can be a successful and cost‐effective complement for selected patients.

TI: The Use of Videoconferencing for Monitoring of Patients Post Urologic Surgery
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02771431
YR: 2016
AB: As the healthcare system in America is evolving, doctors are becoming hard‐pressed to see and treat more patients in the same amount of time. Over the past century, different forms of "telemedicine" have allowed doctors to treat patients from a distance, in hopes of increasing access to medical care. Several studies have evaluated the utility of telemedicine in the ICU setting, namely using video‐conferencing technology to allow ICU attending physicians to monitor their patients with audio and video media more closely. A prospective, step‐wedge study by Lily showed that the use of telemedicine reduced adjusted odds mortality and length of stay in the ICU, as well as several complications such as stress ulcers, deep venous thromboses, and ventilator associated pneumonia. Similar conclusions were found by a meta‐analysis in 2011 that looked at 176 tele‐ICU articles, which included 41,374 patients. With telemedicine technology, intensivists can theoretically have 24‐hour oversight of the ICU from a remote location, possibly being able to oversee multiple units. Although the average urology patient does not require as frequent monitoring as the ICU patient, telemedicine may still play a role in facilitating care for the postoperative urologic patient. In 2004, Ellison el al conducted a study comparing patient satisfaction between patients seen via standard bedside rounds, patients seen via telerounds (as an additional visit) through a laptop computer, and patients only seen via telerounds through a remotely controlled robot. This study showed that telerounding (either of the latter two arms) was associated with greater patient satisfaction in postoperative care, which was found to be linked to physician availability4. In 2007, the same authors conducted a randomized study investigating morbidity, length of stay, and patient satisfaction between standard bedside rounds versus robotic telerounding. There were no differences in outcomes between the two groups. A significant limitation of robotic telerounding is cost. Having and maintaining the robot costs around $60,000 per year, although Gandas et al was able to find a positive financial impact when using the robot in postoperative gastric bypass patients6. However, the development of tablet computers, which have user‐friendly video‐conferencing applications, has made telemedicine a more affordable tool. In 2012, Kacsmarek et al conducted the first study using tablet computers investigating post‐operative patient satisfaction. Their study demonstrated that tablet telerounding can significantly enhance patients' post‐operative experience by providing quicker face‐to‐face access with their attending physician. Our study would be the first randomized study investigating the use of video conferencing via tablet computers versus traditional bedside rounding and its effect on clinical data such as length of stay and complications as well as patient satisfaction. As technology improves, medicine has an obligation to incorporate this technology to improve efficiency and cost‐effectiveness. If telerounding is proven to not change outcomes or patient satisfaction, it saves time for the physician during office hours to see more patients or be productive in other ways. Telerounding could be applied in remote areas with a dearth of specialists, allowing these specialists' expertise to reach areas it could not before.

YR: 2018
AB: INTERVENTION: Complex intervention involving Participatory Women's Groups (PWGs) being supported to engage with Maternal and Child Health audit data from their community/PHC service and suggesting interventions to improve quality of care. These groups will use the Remote Services Futures methodology to engage with MCH audit data; collect information about strengths and limitations of MCH care in that context, co‐produce a MCH quality improvement plan for that site, co‐implementation of that plan and monitoring. PWGs will be formed for each community in the study and supported by local facilitators with remote support from the project team.. Two facilitators for each group will be identified from within the community with the assistance of the health service and community women and trained. Training will occur during a one week training program in the first year of the project (probably held in Cairns), covering group facilitation skills, familiarisation with MCH audit data and the RSF process as a framework for supporting the initiatiation and conduct of PWGs, with the aim of engaging with MCH audit data and facilitating action to promote quality of MCH care. This training will also help facilitators form relationships with the research team members and other facilitators to enable ongoing remote support for the process. Comprehensive refresher training will be done on site just prior to implementation of the intervention. PWGs will be supported by the PWG facilitators (with significant support from the project team include remote reminders and prompts and a project team member attending each participating health service during the first cycle of workshops) to meet for a series of four planning workshops (held at approximately monthly intervals over the first six months of the intervention at each site). Three initiatives from the community MCH improvement plan developed will be prioritised for implementation, and a series of four implementation workshops will be held over the following 8 months at approximately bi‐monthly intervals. Annual meetings to bring facilitators together and disseminate their experiences will share learning and enhance the knowledge base to respond to local priorities. Adherence and fidelity of the intervention will be assessed using detailed process evaluation, including facilitator structured field journals, interviews (with PWG facilitators and PWG participatants) and direct observation . CONDITION: Antenatal care PRIMARY OUTCOME: Maternal and child health quality of care index (MCH‐QCI) ‐ indicates overall adherence to delivering recommended services (total number of services provided)/(total number of recommended services)*100. Previously validated and published methodology. ; This outcome measure is assessed through annual cross‐sectional chart audit data using the usual mechanisms used by the service. Some of these involve automatic data extraction using PENCAT tools and some involve direct paper auditing of records. Patients attending the service whose charts may be audited are women with an infant aged between 2 and 14 months, resident in the community for at least 6 months of the pregnancy and using the PHC service as her usual source of care. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Cost‐effectiveness and cost‐consequence analysis of the intervention. Costs for the CCA and CEA will be obtained from trial data, and include all training, staff time, and resource use costs to the health systems for a hypothetical national roll‐out of the program. The outcomes for the CCA will be all the primary and secondary outcomes for the study. The outcome for the CEA will be 100g increase in mean birthweight. The number of women needed to be treated (NNT) to achieve this increase will be calculated based upon change in birthweights over the intervention period adjusting for confounding factors (maternal age, parity). Incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio will then be estimated from the additional costs of providing the intervention multiplied by the NNT. Mean birthweight. ; This measure will be assessed from chart audits within the service. Percentage of pregnant women having their first antenatal visit before 13 weeks gestation. This measure will be assessed from chart audits within the service. Women's empowerment using Global Growth and Empowerment Scale (GEM) with PWG members and facilitators. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Indigenous primary health care services are eligible to take part if they: 1. are engaged in MCH auditing using a recognised tool. 2. are willing to support staff member participation in facilitator training 3. have agreement from CEO, Board and key staff to participate. Participatory women's group facilitators and PWG participants are any local community women with an interest in the health of mums and bubs ‐ may include mothers, Elders, other community women (ideally linking in with other community initiatives). Women whose charts are audited in terms of the primary and secondary outcomes are any woman in the community with an infant aged between 2 and 14 months at the time of the audit, resident in the community for at least 6 months of her pregnancy and using the PHC service as her usual source of care.

This document reflects the latest research studies based on tele‐rehabilitation (TR), its application in chronic lung diseases and the topics that still needs to be investigated. TR Studies of TR in patients with lymphedema (Galiano‐Castillo et al., 2014) or COPD (Paneroni et al., 2014)(Tousignant et al., 2012)(Dinesen, Seeman, and Gustafsson, 2011)(Dinesen, Huniche, and Toft, 2013) or in the orthopedic areas as, lower back (Palacín‐Marín et al., 2013), knee (Cabana et al., 2010) (Tousignant, Moffet, et al., 2011) (Tousignant, Boissy, et al., 2011) and shoulder (Eriksson et al., 2009)(Eriksson, Lindström and Ekenberg, 2011) show that tele‐technology has been developed to a level where it is possible to treat, test and follow‐up patients from a distance. Patients who have not been offered such solutions face increased risks of hospital‐acquired infections (Dancer, 2009) and longer travel and waiting time to get treated. The public sector expects higher expenditure due to treatment and transportation cost, specifically in chronic patients and the elderly whose numbers tends to increase according to demographics trend (Palacín‐Marín et al., 2013)(Barros et al., 2011)(Parker and Thorslund, 2007)(Yach, Hawkes, Gould, and Hofman, 2004). Such facts points to the need of creating and improving solution that overcome such health care challenges. TR seems to be a good approach to reach patients in low inhabited areas (Hill and Sppath, 2010), changing health care to self‐care (Haarder, 2011), empowering patient's awareness on their disease and increasing the flexibility patients need to acquire to obtain healthier behaviors. Although the interest in TR research is high, there is still a need for more studies on the efficacy (Paneroni et al., 2014) and cost‐effectiveness of TR (Paneroni et al., 2014) (Langberg, Lindahl, Kidholm, and Dinesen, 2014) just as the long‐term effects of TR have to be determined (Langberg et al., 2014). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) COPD is among the most resource costly diseases we face in our century (Kjøller, Juel and Kamper‐Jørgensen, 2007). In Denmark, approximately 430,000 people have COPD of which around 50,000 have severe COPD (Kirkegaard N, Brandt A, Timm H, 2013)(Mannino, Doherty and Sonia Buist, 2006). Eriksen (Eriksen and Vestbo, 2010) states that up to 42.3% of patients with COPD discharged from hospitals are readmitted the following year, and 17% of patients treated in emergency departments require hospitalization. Danish pulmonary physicians concluded that COPD cost the Danish society three billion DKK in 2002 (Hos, 2007) where up to 20% of the most severe COPD patients consume over 70% of the total health expenditure (Jansson et al., 2002). Nowadays, some municipalities have already problems with offering rehabilitation services to all COPD patients in some areas in Denmark (Kjøller, Juel and Kamper‐Jørgensen, 2007). Actions implementing TR for COPD patients have been started and research begins to show some improvements. Pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD The objective of treatment for patients with COPD is to delay the progression of the disease, prevent acute exacerbations, improve quality of life, reduce symptoms and reduce mortality. Rehabilitation of COPD includes among others physical training and patient education (Sundhedsstyrelsen, 2007). There is a need for an improved prevention and treatment of exacerbations (Barnes et al., 2013). Despite the poor evidence about determinants of physical activity and impact of treatment in COPD patients (Gimeno‐Santos et al., 2014), a wide range of interventions are commonly used by physiotherapist to treat individuals with COPD (Kozu et al., 2011),(Kenn, Gloeckl and Behr, 2013) (Garrod and Lasserson, 2007). Researchers have shown significant improvement in general condition (Lacasse, Guyatt and Goldstein, 1997)(Ries et al., 1995)(Lacasse et al., 2009)(Nava, 1998)(Simpson et al., 1992), quality of life (Wijkstra et al., 1995)(Bendstrup et al., 1997), long‐term survival (Godoy, 2007), sputum clearance (Garrod and Lasserson, 2007) (Oldenburg et al., 1979); Health‐related quality of life (Almagro and Castro, 2013) (Blackstock et al., 2013) (Jones, 2013)(Bendstrup et al., 1997), training of muscle strength and exercise tolerance (Ortega et al., 2002)(Bendstrup et al., 1997), walking distance (Ries et al., 2007) (Ringbaek et al., 2008) (Wedzicha et al., 1998), exercise capacity, endurance (Lacasse, Guyatt and Goldstein, 1997) (Ries et al., 1995) (Lacasse et al., 2009) (Nava, 1998) (Simpson et al., 1992); days of hospitalization (Ries et al., 2007) (Griffiths et al., 2000), tachypnea (Lacasse, Guyatt and Goldstein, 1997) (Ortega et al., 2002) and morbidity (Godoy, 2007). Although the advantages of PR are many, its implementation should be placed alongside the routine treatment options (Ozalevli et al., 2010). It has been shown that the frequency of emergency department presentations and hospital admissions in COPD patients was significantly reduced after participation in early discharge care with ongoing follow‐up support (Lawlor et al., 2009). Tele‐rehabilitation in COPD Tele‐rehabilitation at home is feasible and well accepted by patients, although technology may be perceived as difficult (Paneroni et al., 2014)(Tousignant et al., 2012). It seems to improve walking capacity, dyspnea, quality of life and daily physical activity (Paneroni et al., 2014). The interaction between the COPD patients at home and the healthcare professionals at the clinic through TR has evolved as a dialogue channel forming the basis for mutual learning processes and new relationships (Dinesen et al., 2011). Here, patients exhibit four types of attitudes about their tele‐rehabilitation: indifference, learning as part of situations in everyday life, feeling of security and motivation for performing physical training (Dinesen, Huniche and Toft, 2013). Preliminary evaluations from tele‐rehabilitation initiatives in Scotland showed tele‐rehabilitation to be more cost effective for patients living in remote areas compared to an out‐reach‐ or centralized model (Hill and Sppath, 2010). Hypothesis: There is still a need for more studies of the efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of TR, just as also the long‐term effects of TR have to be determined. To guarantee individuals with COPD a qualitative service from health care organizations in the coming decades and economically save the national health systems for an expensive bill to treating COPD, new actions plans has to be taken in mind in order to treat more patients with less human resources and still sustaining or improving today's services. The importance of such welfare action plans has to maintain a quality of service that individuals with COPD are willing to accept. Here, TR seems to be a good welfare action plans. Despite improved cost effectiveness, evidence supporting patient ´s adherence and security, treatment efficacy and improvements of quality of life with tele‐rehabilitation in COPD is still warranted. To assess and compare the feasibility and effect of a follow‐up tele‐rehabilitation program after standard COPD rehabilitation with a new and innovative TR platform (NITRP) compared to standard follow‐up after COPD rehabilitation with respect to exercise capacity, quality of life and activities of daily living in patients with COPD. The primary purpose of the study is to assess the effect of tele‐rehabilitation after standard COPD rehabilitation with a NITRP compared to the usual follow‐up after standard COPD rehabilitation on exercise capacity and quality of life in COPD patients based on the following hypotheses: Activities of daily living, exercise capacity and health‐related quality of life are equal or improved by follow‐up tele‐rehabilitation after standard COPD rehabilitation compared to follow‐up. The secondary purpose is to investigate the efficacy and cost effectiveness of follow‐up tele‐rehabilitation after standard COPD rehabilitation with a NITRP compared to usual follow‐up on "number of acute exacerbations and number of visits to the health care system in a period of time" and "rehabilitation‐ and transportation costs" in rehabilitation of COPD patients based on the following hypothesis: The rehabilitation costs of tele‐rehabilitation after standard COPD rehabilitation are lower or equal compared to conventional rehabilitation response.

AB: BACKGROUND: Self blood pressure monitoring at home may improve blood pressure control and patients' compliance with treatment, but its implementation in daily practice faces difficulties. Teletransmission facilities may offer a more efficient approach to long‐term home blood pressure monitoring. METHODS: Twelve general practitioners screened 391 consecutive uncontrolled mild‐moderate hypertensive patients (80% treated), 329 of whom (58 +/‐ 11 years, 54% men) were randomized to either usual care on the basis of office blood pressure (group A, n = 113) or to integrated care on the basis of teletransmitted home blood pressure (group B, n = 216). Twenty‐four‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed at baseline and after 6 months, during which treatment was optimized according to either office (group A) or home (group B) blood pressure values. We compared differences between groups in the rate of daytime ambulatory blood pressure normalization (<130/80 mmHg), need of treatment changes during follow‐up, quality of life scores, and healthcare costs. RESULTS: Baseline office blood pressures were 149 +/‐ 12/89 +/‐ 9 and 148 +/‐ 13/89 +/‐ 7 mmHg in groups A (n = 111) and B (n = 187) respectively, the corresponding daytime values being 140 +/‐ 11/84 +/‐ 8 and 139 +/‐ 11/84 +/‐ 8 mmHg. The percentage of daytime blood pressure normalization was higher in group B (62%) than in group A (50%) (P < 0.05). There were less frequent treatment changes in group B than in group A (9 vs. 14%, P < 0.05). Quality of life tended to be higher and costs lower in group B. CONCLUSION: Patients' management based on home blood pressure teletransmission led to a better control of ambulatory blood pressure than with usual care, with a more regular treatment regimen.

YR: 2016
KY: Otitis; Otitis Media
AB: Providing patients with understandable, comprehensive discharge instructions improves compliance, thereby reducing symptoms and the functional impact of illness. Comprehensive discharge instructions also reduce patient anxiety and increases satisfaction. Unfortunately, in a busy emergency department (ED), discharge instructions are often incomplete. Furthermore, even when discharge instructions have been provided, patients often have difficulty comprehending and/or recalling them. Inadequate discharge instructions are linked to medication errors, suboptimal care post‐discharge, and unnecessary return visits to the ED. Patient dissatisfaction with discharge instructions and anxiety have also been linked to poor medication compliance, and an increase in return visits. Studies have demonstrated that knowledge of pediatric medical conditions can be enhanced through the use of video technology. Specifically, it has been shown that when video discharge instructions are used in place of, or to complement written discharge instructions, patients have a better understanding of their illness and report higher rates of satisfaction. However, no studies to date have explored if clinically relevant outcomes such as symptomatology, function and recidivism can be improved. This study will examine the utility of video discharge instructions for the diagnosis of acute otitis media (AOM), a leading cause of health care visits among children. AOM affects up to 75% of children before school‐age and is the most common illness for which antibiotics are prescribed to children in the United States. In Canada, AOM is associated with substantial use of health services (3.1 hours in an emergency department and 1.8 hours in an outpatient clinic on average per visit) and significantly burdens caregivers in the form of time spent on medical consultations, and time taken off from work. An American study estimated that the cost of one episode of AOM in a 3‐month period following diagnosis was $1330.58, with the majority of that cost stemming from the indirect costs of illness, 90% of which was accrued primarily by parental time off work. In Quebec, the total annual cost to the health care system for otitis media and placement of tympanostomy tubes is more than $10 million dollars. Pain is often substantial in the early course of AOM. Poorly controlled pain is associated with suffering and can be emotionally traumatic, causing anxiety for patients and their caregivers. Efficacious treatment for child pain is paramount in preventing protracted sensitivity to pain. Despite the magnitude of effects that acute pain can have on a child, it is often inadequately assessed and treated. In children less than two years of age, 30% of children continue to experience pain, fever, or both for up to 7 into the illness, thus highlighting the importance of caregiver education on symptom management. Recurrent AOM is common, 5‐15% of children under the age of 2 experience four or more episodes per year. Caregivers of children with recurrent AOM not only judge their child's quality of life markedly lower than caregivers of children of a general population, but also lower than those of children with mild‐to‐moderately severe chronic conditions. Although uncommon, AOM also has the potential to cause serious complications such as, mastoiditis and bacterial meningitis, if not treated and monitored appropriately. The investigators hypothesize that video discharge instructions directed at caregivers of children with AOM will be associated with improved symptomatology and functional outcomes, along with improved caregiver knowledge, satisfaction, and anxiety compared to the standard of care, paper‐based discharge instructions.

YR: 2018
AB: INTERVENTION: The telehealth Making Sense of Brain Tumour (Tele‐MAST) program is adapted from the face‐to‐face Making Sense of Brain Tumor program. This program involves 10 x 1 hour weekly individual therapy sessions delivered by a psychologist, with the focus of support guided by individuals’ goals and family involvement (i.e., individual, couple, and family support sessions). Common goals relate to understanding the effects of brain tumour (psychoeducation), managing emotional distress (psychoeducation & psychotherapy), managing cognitive and behavioural changes (cognitive rehabilitation, family education), improving relationship functioning (couple & family‐based support), and addressing fears/concerns regarding end‐of‐life issues and legacy making. Participants will use their own device (PC, laptop, Ipad) from home to receive therapy sessions via Zoom video‐conferencing. Family members' involvement in therapy will vary across programs, depending on the family member's availability and the program goals. Therapy sessions will be recorded using Zoom Cloud Recording (M4A files, audio only) with 15% reviewed (random selection) at the end of the project to examine adherence to the therapy protocol. CONDITION: Anxiety Depression Primary brain tumour PRIMARY OUTCOME: Depression ; ; Severity of depression will be measured using the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale: a semi‐structured clinical interview assessing the presence and severity of depression.

The EQ‐5D items include mobility, self‐care, usual activities, pain/discomfort & anxiety/depression. EQ‐5D scores (0 = worse possible health to 1 = perfect health) are used to weight survival time to generate QALYs. Incremental cost per effect ratios will be generated from the EQ‐5D data using an Australian algorithm and norms to represent the additional cost and health benefits of the Tele‐MAST program over and above that of usual care. The difference in mean costs divided by the difference in mean QALYs/% improvers generates the incremental cost per QALY/% improver ratios between two arms. These analyses will be conducted by a senior health economist.

YR: 2018
AB: INTERVENTION: Participants were identified by social services and will be randomly allocated in two groups, intervention and treatment as usual control group. Participants randomization was made according to a list of computer generated numbers. The research assistants involved in the evaluation will be blind to the process of randomization. Group Triple P is a group variant of Level 4 Triple P providing moderate to high intensity intervention and focusing on improving parent‐child interaction and the application of parenting skills to a broad range of target behaviors. It consists of four weekly group sessions, three individual phone consultations and one closure group session. Given the low level of literacy of participating mothers, the first and third sessions were divided in two (as described in the Triple P manual) so as to attain all established objectives. Each group session lasts for approximately 2 hours, while the phone consultations are supposed to take 15‐20 minutes each. The group sessions include content presentation, video watching, group discussions, and role‐play exercises to promote positive and consistent parenting practices. Parents are also encouraged to do take‐home exercises to reinforce the content provided in each session. Group Triple P utilizes an active skills training process to teach parents a variety of parenting skills. Parents are introduced to 17 positive parenting strategies including strategies to develop good relationships with children, encourage desirable behaviors, teach new skills and behaviors, and manage children’s misbehavior, as well as planned activities routines for high‐risk situations to help parents to generalize and maintain parenting skills across settings and over time. During phone sessions, difficulties identified by parents or issues that parents would like to debate are discussed with practitioner. Parents in the control group will receive treatment‐as‐usual. Mothers receive economic support from Portuguese social welfare CONDITION: Mental health in caregivers and their children who live in high psychosocial risk situations ; Mental and Behavioural Disorders PRIMARY OUTCOME: 1. Emotional and behavioral symptoms in children, measured through the subscales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ‐P; Godman, 1997) and Conner’s Teacher Rating Scale (Conners, 1998). This measures will be accomplished by principal caregivers and teachers at three timepoints: pre‐intervention, post‐intervention and at 12‐months follow‐up.; 2.

TI: Medication Adherence Telemonitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Readmissions
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02378571
YR: 2015
KY: Heart Failure
AB: Approximately one in four patients hospitalized with heart failure is readmitted within 30 days of discharge and more than 50% are readmitted within 6 months of discharge. Heart failure admissions are a major contributor to the enormous health care costs associated with heart failure. Thus far, the identification of effective interventions that prevent unnecessary readmissions has remained elusive. As a result, there is a pressing need to identify novel, cost‐effective approaches to reducing heart failure readmissions. A growing body of research suggests that poor adherence to heart failure medications is a major reason for preventable heart failure readmissions. In particular, loop diuretic medications are essential to preventing the cardiopulmonary system from becoming overloaded. Patients who have been recently hospitalized may be especially vulnerable to adherence problems as a result of the stress of the recent hospitalization which commonly induces sleep deprivation, nutritional deficiency, physical deconditioning, cognitive impairment, and even delirium. Recent advances in wireless health now enable us to remotely, unobtrusively, and objectively monitor adherence to heart failure medications in the post‐discharge period. Early identification of non‐adherence to loop diuretic medications has the prevention to prevent a volume overloaded state that leads to a heart failure readmission. As patients who are non‐adherent to their loop diuretics may also be non‐adherent to other recommended self‐management behaviors, early identification of medication nonadherence may provide the context to identify other gaps in self‐management. To test our hypothesis that it is feasible to conduct a randomized trial of wireless, medication adherence monitoring with feedback to patients and clinicians, the investigators will enroll 40 patients who are hospitalized for heart failure and discharged on a diuretic medication. Patients will be randomized to 1) usual heart failure care + telemonitoring adherence to diuretic medications (INT); N=20 or 2) usual heart failure care (CTR); N=20. All patients will be asked to take their diuretic medication from a standard pill bottle covered by an electronic pill cap (GlowCap), but only patients assigned to the intervention arm will have their adherence telemonitored by a study clinician in real‐time. Patients will have their adherence to medications measured in this fashion for 30 days after discharge. Patients will be contacted at 30 days to determine if they have been hospitalized and to collect other self‐reported outcomes data.

KY: Dyssomnias; Osteoarthritis; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Parasomnias; Sleep Wake Disorders
AB: Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of disability in the elderly population and most individuals suffering from osteoarthritis is managed in the primary care setting (1). Knee osteoarthritis is a most common form of arthritis in the world (2). The rate of knee arthritis is as high as that of cardiac disease and is the most common problem in the individuals over the age of 65 (3). In the United Kingdom, 10% of 65‐74‐year‐old individuals consult their general practitioners about osteoarthritis per year (4). 4% population attend their general practitioners as a result of knee osteoarthritis and half of them (2%) consult their general practitioner for the first time or with the acute flare of knee arthritis (1). According to national and international guidelines, the first line treatment for osteoarthritis pain (OA) is non‐surgical; exercise, information and, in relevant cases, weight loss (5‐9). There is enough evidence for the effectiveness of exercises in the management of knee osteoarthritis and to improve the functional capacity of these individuals to cope better with the activities of daily living (10‐24). In fact, one study reported a slow down of progressive radiographic changes of knee OA as a result of strengthening exercises (25).There is a significant disparity on the effectiveness of different types of exercises for the knee osteoarthritis, and a combination of open and closed isotonic exercises are recommended knee osteoarthritis (26) with the exception to those individuals who find these exercises difficult and painful. In such groups, isometric exercises of knee muscles should be considered (26). In an attempt to manage the knee osteoarthritis, one can exacerbate the symptoms of knee arthritis by following ineffective or unsafe exercises leading to poor prognosis and poor adherence to these exercises (27), hence one should choose the exercises carefully. As knee arthritis is a significant issue in the elderly population, therefore, the less expensive community‐based approach will be beneficial for these patients. There are previous studies which have assessed the efficacy of home‐based exercises and reported good results (12, 14, 28) however there are only a few studies which looked at the web‐based exercises on the knee arthritis (29‐33). Unfortunately, most of these studies recruited patients with knee pain, and radiographic evidence of knee osteoarthritis was undermined except one study (31). It infers that these web‐based exercises can be used for knee pain which may include cases of soft tissue injuries, arthritic knee or any other reason for knee pain. However, generalising these results on the group of patients with knee osteoarthritis warrants a risk of increasing their pain just in case that those exercises are strenuous or more demanding. The aim of this study is to explore the benefits of web‐based exercises in the patients with knee osteoarthritis to establish if their pain decreases after six weeks. Being a web‐based set of activities, it makes it more accessible to the patients living in rural areas and should make it more cost‐effective requiring no travelling time. Our study is different from the other studies as there is not a single study (to our knowledge) which has studied web‐based intervention on United Kingdom population of knee osteoarthritis. Furthermore, the investigators will endeavour to recruit only those individuals who have radiographic evidence of knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, this study will produce recommendations for the clinical setups where most of the symptomatic patients have radiographic evidence of knee osteoarthritis. The investigators will be using a web‐based exercises platform known as Joint Academy (JA) as recent pilot studies (32, 33) demonstrated promising results for this platform. This programme is based on Swedish face to face self‐management program known as 'Artrosskolan' (The Osteoarthritis School) which provides structured information and exercises for knee arthritis to the relevant population suffering from knee arthritis. The efficacy of it is covered elsewhere (34). The company that produced the Joint Academy platform has given consent to use their web based platform to conduct this study. The investigators will recruit 134 individuals with the clinical evidence of radiographic knee arthritis, and these will be randomised into a control group and an interventional group (67 individuals in each group). The interventional group will get the login details for the Joint Academy (JA), and they will follow the strengthening exercises for six weeks with educational material online relevant to knee osteoarthritis. They will record their pain levels on the Numerical rating scale (NRS) at baseline and at the end of the trial. The validity and sensitivity of NRS have been established numerous times (35‐39). Other than determining the subjective pain levels, the investigators will use standardised quantitative sensory testing (QST) such as pressure pain threshold (PPT), temporal summation (TS) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM). Pressure Pain threshold (PPT) has been used in previous studies done on the knee arthritis and deemed to be a valid and reliable method to establish tenderness around the knee joint (40‐45). Similarly, temporal summation (TS) has been used in previous studies (40, 43, 44, 46) to establish whether individuals have an element of central sensitisation thus amplifying their localised knee pains. Conditioned pain paradigms are commonly used to assess the function of endogenous pain inhibitory pathways in humans. In this technique, a painful test stimulus is evaluated in the absence and in the presence of a second painful (conditioning) stimulus applied to a remote region of the body. In a typically functioning nociceptive system, the amount of pain experienced with the primary test stimulus will be reduced during the presentation of the secondary conditioning stimulus (47‐49). Decreased inhibition of experimental pain is found in many patients with idiopathic pain syndromes (50‐58). It predicts the tendency to develop future chronic pain (59, 60). The purpose of using QST is to establish objective data as to whether these exercises reduce the localised tenderness or global central sensitisation. The investigators will use the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) which is widely utilised in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self‐administered questionnaire made of 24 items and consists of three subscales covering pain, stiffness and physical function. It has been used extensively and deemed to be a valid and reliable tool (61‐65). For the quality of life, stiffness, generalised well‐being, difficulty with sleeping and understanding of the diagnosis and treatment, the investigators will use patient‐reported outcome measure 'The Arthritis Research UK Musculoskeletal Health Questionnaire' (MSK‐HQ). MSK‐HQ covers a broad aspect of musculoskeletal conditions, and recent studies have shown it to be reliable and valid (66, 67). Both the 30‐second sit to stand test (30CST) and the 'time up and go' (TUG) test will be used to see if you have improved their lower limb fitness levels. 30CST has shown excellent reliability and validity (65, 68, 69). TUG has been widely used in clinical setups and is a valid tool to assess necessary functional mobility (70‐76). In this study, the investigators aim to assess the sleeping pattern of individuals suffering from degenerative changes of the knee and purpose is to determine whether sleeping patterns improve when the exercises for knee osteoarthritis are introduced. Disturbed sleep is a frequent complaint of people experiencing chronic pain such as those with knee osteoarthritis (OA) (77‐83). The resultant changes in sleep architecture can affect health even in the presence of apparently adequate sleep duration. For example, an insufficient amount of slow wave sleep associates with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, poor cognition and obesity (84‐89).Sleep disturbances are present in 67‐88% of people with chronic pain and ≥50% individuals with insomnia have chronic pain (85, 90). Actigraphy will be used to assess the sleeping data which has been used widely and deemed as a valid method (91‐96). The investigators will also use Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) which has been used in multiple studies and validated to measure sleep disturbances (97‐101). The investigators aim to conduct Musculoskeletal Ultrasound scan (MSK‐USS) on the knees of these individuals to establish if they have inflammation of synovial membrane. There is enough evidence that inflammation is present in all stages of osteoarthritis (102‐105). Synovitis or inflammation of synovial fluid is associated with pain, disease severity and progression of osteoarthritis (102, 106). Synovitis manifests as synovial membrane thickening, increased vascularity and/or joint effusion (102, 107‐109). As standard radiographs are unable to visualise the synovial membrane, therefore, the investigators anticipate using an ultrasound machine. The investigators will assess synovial fluid, hypertrophy of synovium and presence of Power Doppler during the ultrasound scan. Synovial hypertrophy, synovitis and knee effusion are linked with arthritis in the knee and associated with knee pain in osteoarthritis (110‐115). Power Doppler provides a reliable and accurate method for visualising blood flow in the synovial tissue, and histological findings support the value of this technique (113, 116, 117). An ultrasound scan is proved to be a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of synovial disease (107, 113, 114, 118) and synovitis is strongly associated with osteoarthritis as mentioned earlier. The investigators aim to aspirate the synovial fluid (SF) (subjective to the consent of the patient), and the purpose is to establish if the investigators can assess the synovial fluid to predict the phenotype which is strongly associated with osteoarthritis. Studying synovial fluid (SF) biomarkers alongside clinical, radiographic and ultra‐sonographic characteristics is one strategy to improve resolution and stratification into targetable OA phenotypes (119). Ultrasound‐guided aspiration (USGA) of synovial fluid is a safe procedure and less painful when compared to anatomical guided aspirations (120‐123). The investigators will also endeavour to assess the isometric strength of quadriceps to establish if these exercises improve the dynamic strength of knee extensors. Quadriceps muscles strength deficits are associated with knee osteoarthritis (124). Isometric testing will be done at 30 and 60 degrees of flexion as done in a previous study (125). The investigators aim to ultrasound the muscle mass around the knee and wishes to check if six weeks exercise program results in any difference to the muscle mass around the knee. There are conflicting results whether vastus medialis or vastus lateralis atrophies significantly when all four muscles of quadriceps have been assessed and compared. It is evident that decreased strength of quadriceps muscles is found in the population suffering from the knee arthritis (126‐130). One study suggested that all four muscles of knee extensors atrophy similarly in the elderly population (131). Another study reported atrophy of type 2 fibres in vastus lateralis and associated it to osteoarthritis when compared to controlled group (132). Other studies have associated atrophy of vastus medialis with arthritis (133, 134) and greater vastus medialis cross‐sectional area is associated with reduced knee pain and reduced medial tibial cartilage loss (135). A recent study has studied the sonographic changes of vastus lateralis after introducing exercises and correlated the findings to the MRI scan, and they conclude that ultrasound is a valid method of assessing muscle thickness (136). This study has used vastus lateralis muscle to conclude these findings and therefore the investigators plan to measure vastus lateralis muscle mass thickness and pennation angle as described in earlier studies (136, 137). The pennation angle is defined as the angle between muscle fibres and the deep fascia of the muscle (137). The pennation angle correlates with the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force which is a measurement of muscle strength (137), thus the ultrasound scan will indirectly establish if the exercises have led to an increase in maximum voluntary contraction. The investigators will also extract the blood samples at baseline and after six weeks to assess the biomarkers and to establish insulin resistance (138, 139). A urine sample will be taken as well. Studying these parameters will help us to understand the traits of osteoarthritis, their correlation to each other and potential detrimental effects of them on the health of knee joint. This study will help us to establish whether web‐based intervention can replicate the results which it has produced in Swedish population and if it does, then next target will be to assess the socio‐economic benefits of this programme over the standard treatment for knee arthritis provided in the community set up in the United Kingdom.

KY: Tuberculosis
AB: TB is a global health problem and in South Africa rates as the second most important problem in terms of Burden of Disease. There are many reasons for this, among which are diagnostic difficulties, extended treatments, drug resistance and health care provision. This application is concerned with all these drivers and will focus activities on a clinic which provides basic care in a very deprived socio‐economic area of greater Cape Town, South Africa. Patients studied in routine, but demanding environments are our focus as these clinics are representative of many areas where TB (and HIV) are found at high prevalence. If the constraints of working in such areas can be understood and appropriate changes that work made, the investigators believe the outputs and policy changes generated in this study will contribute to future success in other settings. The investigators wish to study the implementation of the Xpert®MTB/RIF (Xpert) and Xpert Ultra (Ultra) systems in situ using a randomised controlled trial design, as opposed to a remote site (central laboratory), to assess whether time to diagnosis can be improved using point of care (POC). The investigators wish to maximise this opportunity by collecting biological samples from a patient population experiencing a TB epidemic for the evaluation of future TB diagnostics. Using human DNA, the investigators will attempt to determine reasons for poor or no treatment response. Two possibilities exist for this: a) the M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to the drug in question or b) the patient is highly susceptible to the bacterium. The investigators will determine the exome sequences of study participants with susceptible M. tuberculosis strains who show poor or no response, and compare this with rapid responders. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, the investigators will also observe how the microbiome of TB patients is altered during TB treatment and how this is associated with treatment outcome, as well as after TB treatment. This project will set the foundation for the implementation of new POC TB diagnostic technologies in clinics in South Africa. The biobanked specimens collected can be rapidly utilised for nascent technologies. Studying the patient microbiome will provide insights into what makes some patients more susceptible to TB and what microbiological changes occur during the course of anti‐TB treatment.

AB: This study is to demonstrate that chronic disease patients receiving collaborative care with ICT‐based self‐management and educational program can improve clinical outcomes and overall health status, including quality of life and health habits. In addition to the economic burden, people with chronic disease experience various psychosocial crises such as anxiety and depression, which causes the deterioration of overall quality of life and increases social burden. The collaborative care management based Chronic Care Model (CCM) have provided coaching by a medically supervised nurse, working with each patient's physician. However, standard CCM have limitations in that they do not provide self‐management strategies of the patient in detail. Therefore, to improve the effectiveness of the CCM model, it is required to propose a new approach to the utilization of IT‐based self‐management program that is currently being developed to increase accessibility and efficiency of health care service. Primary outcomes of this study are as follow: Improvement of depression in patients with osteoporosis, chronic respiratory disease and chronic arthritis. Participants in this study will respond a baseline questionnaire about depressive mood, health habits, health behavior patterns and quality of life, diet, exercise, etc. After that, participants will be allocated equally into three groups ‐ the intervention group 1, intervention group 2 and the control group. The intervention group 1 will receive S Healthing and a tele‐ coaching program conducted 12 times (one time for one week), and more than 20 minutes each by a trained nurse. The intervention group 2 will receive S Healthing while the control group will receive basic educational material on the disease. Coaching content consists specifically of: 1) evaluation, 2) facing and accepting the health crisis, 3) setting up new goals, 4) making decisions and plans, and 5) practice. "S Healthing" is based ICT‐ program and includes educational contents and self‐management program based on Smart Management Strategy for Health (SMASH). The intervention group 1, 2 will conduct self‐management for 3 months through smart phone application and web program. Participants will receive a questionnaire about the quality of life and health habits with the clinical examination 3 months after baseline survey was conducted. The result from two questionnaires (baseline, 3 months post‐intervention) and clinical outcome of baseline and 3 months will be compiled and be compared with others.

TI: Efficacy of Two Ways of Applying Homework Assignments in the Treatment of Adjustment Disorders
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02452411
YR: 2015
KY: Adjustment Disorders; Disease
AB: Adjustment Disorders (AD) are very prevalent in primary care and hospital settings. The available data indicate that the percentage of adults suffering from AD in primary care ranges from 5% to 21%. Furthermore, AD is an important public mental health problem in economic terms. Very frequently the distress and activity deterioration associated to this problem result in a decrease of work performance, causing a high percentage of sick leaves. However, nowadays there are no evidence‐based psychological treatments for this problem, and only general treatment guidelines are available for this problem. For these reason, a Cognitive‐Behavioral Treatment (CBT) supported by Virtual Reality (VR; EMMA system) was developed and has already shown its utility to treat this disorder. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are useful tools for offer and improve therapeutic services. VR offers a safe and flexible environment in where the person can explore and manage their problems in a controlled and gradual way. Computerized programs allow reducing the contact time between therapist and patient, so it can reach patients who would not receive treatment otherwise. ICTs have been mainly used within the therapeutic context; specifically many studies have been centered on how to use the technologies to deliver the treatment. As far as the investigators know, no study analyzes the ICTs contribution in the homework assignments field. CBT approach provides a crucial role to homework assignments because it allows reinforcing and supporting the patients along the therapy. More studies examining the utility of the application of ICTs for the treatment of AD are needed. Furthermore, the application of the homework assignments component through the Internet is also relevant. It is necessary an adaptive and flexible system that allows adjusting the therapeutic homework on every patient's characteristics and needs, attending to the specific meaning of his/her problem. This would be a way to facilitate the patient's treatment adherence and in consequence improve the effectiveness of the AD treatment. In the present study the differential efficacy of two ways of applied homework assignments for the treatment of AD is explored with a between subject randomized controlled trial. After the evaluation phase, all participants receive a 6‐8 sessions weekly CBT program. After each treatment session, they practice their assigned homework (using TEO or in the Traditional way) and they assess several clinical variables. After treatment completion, a post‐treatment assessment will be carried out as well as follow‐up assessments at 6‐ and 12‐month.

AB: Abstract text The need for serial vaginal sonograms to monitor ovarian stimulation for artificial reproductive technology (ART) treatments remains a cause for stress and sometimes a major practical challenge both for patients and health care providers. It hampers access to treatment for many couples seeking ART treatment or renders it strenuous from an organizational point of view. It creates a hidden cost when people have to travel frequently to have sonograms made or have to plan a hotel stay near the centre where oocyte retrieval and IVF embryology work take place. We have been exploring over the past couple of years the possibilities of a method (Self‐Operated Endo‐vaginal Tele‐monitoring, SOET) allowing patients and/or their partners to make vaginal sonograms themselves at home or in fact anywhere and anytime if WiFi is available. Specific cloud‐based communication software has been developed that can be installed on any notebook or tablet PC. If applicable, midwives, nurses or other health care providers such as general practitioners working independently from highly specialized services, can also perform these recordings. Current experience includes results from a published randomized trial (Hum. Reprod. 2014) comparing SOET with traditional monitoring as well as from a subsequent series of one hundred consecutive ART cycles where patients used SOET instead of traditional monitoring to monitor the stimulation phase. Clinical, laboratory and patient reported outcome data as well as health economic data show that after some initial teaching motivated patients are sufficiently prepared and competent to make and send adequate video recordings to the centre or to the physician following them up. The interpretation of these recordings does not lead to different clinical decisions than when made on‐site using high‐end machines. On‐site back‐up remains always possible if there is a need to confirm unexpected results. This was the case is just 1% of patients. Laboratory and clinical results are similar to those obtained with traditional monitoring and patients are very satisfied with SOET. They can make sonograms discretely where and when it suits them best. Receipt of images and of responses is acknowledged by SMS. After measurement of the growing follicles, a structured response is sent to the patient, comprising dosing advice and next‐step instructions. This facilitates the follow‐up of ovarian stimulation, even if applicable initially to just a selected proportion of IVF patients. It can fit into the general tendency to make IVF more patient‐centred and ‐friendly, to implement tele‐medicine and increase patient empowerment and partner participation by supervised active participation to their treatment. It opens up access to treatment for patients who live far from IVF centres and widens the scope of patient recruitment for centers. If combined with point of care determinations of estradiol to monitor patients at risk for OHSS, SOET may acquire a place in ART although the most recent Cochrane meta‐analysis concludes that systematic E2 measurements do not increase pregnancy rates nor decrease the incidence of OHSS. Impediments for implementation of this technology are disruption of the comfort zone of doctors, the novelty of the technology and financial considerations. SOET is not just a tool, but a disruptive change of practice where the patient and her partner are playing a central and active role in their treatment.

KY: Atrial Fibrillation; Cardiovascular Diseases; Heart Failure
AB: Background: Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally and represent a major economic burden on health care systems. Positive effects of disease management programs have been shown for patients with heart failure (HF). Remote monitoring and telemonitoring with active intervention are beneficial in atrial fibrillation (AF) and therapy resistant hypertension (TRH), respectively. For these patients, the investigators have developed a novel integrated care concept (NICC) which combines telemedicine with intensive support by a call center, an integrated care network including in‐ and outpatient care providers and guideline therapy for patients. Methods: The aim of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of NICC over guideline therapy alone. The trial is designed as open‐label bi‐center parallel‐group design with two groups. Patients will be included if they are either inpatients or if they are referred to the outpatient clinic of the hospitals by their treating physician. Randomization will be done individually with stratification by cardiovascular disease (AF, HF, TRH), center and admission type. Primary endpoints are based on the 1‐year observation period after randomization. The first primary endpoint is the composite endpoint consisting of mortality, stroke and myocardial infarction. The number of hospitalizations form the second primary endpoint. The third primary endpoint is identical to the first primary endpoint plus cardiac decompensation. Adjustments for multiple testing are done using a fall back strategy. Secondary endpoints include patient adherence, health care costs, quality of life and safety. A sample size of 2930 gives 80% power at the two‐sided 2.5% test‐level for the first primary endpoint. The power for the second primary endpoint is 99.8% at this sample size, and it is 80% with 1086 patients. Discussion: This study will inform care providers whether quality of care can be improved by an integrated care concept providing telemedicine through a 24/7 call center approach. We expect that cost of the NICC will be lower than standard care because of reduced hospitalizations. If the study has a positive result, NICC is planned to be immediately rolled out in the state of Mecklenburg‐West Pomerania. The trial will also guide additional research to disentangle the effects of this complex intervention.

AB: The goal of the Enhanced Medication Management Program (eMMp) being developed by MedMinder Systems, Inc. is to increase the ability of frail elders to adhere to complex medication regimens for chronic conditions. Adherence will facilitate effective self‐care and decrease personal and societal costs associated with disease progression and loss of independence. Multiple studies have shown that more frequent personal follow‐up is the most effective way to maximize medication adherence, but such personal care is too costly to translate well to real life in a world of limited healthcare resources. Currently available "smart pillboxes" are too expensive, too limited in the number and types of medications delivered, and too technically complex for the large majority of senior citizens. The eMMp is designed to deliver prompts and reminders to the user, to be remotely programmable by caregivers, to allow the option of using pre‐filled medication trays, to provide electronic adherence reports to family/caregivers and to provide personalized reinforcing phone calls from professional caregivers, all at a modest cost. The in‐home ReMinder will use a familiar pillbox layout (4 doses/day for 7 days) and allow easy removal of medication cups by elderly, rheumatic fingers. Installation will require only an electrical outlet (no modems or dedicated phone lines). Once plugged in, the built‐in pager will continuously download remotely programmed visual and/or aural prompts and reminders from a central server (RemoteMind). It will continuously upload the date and time when each medi‐cation cup is removed and when weekly refill is carried out, enabling remote adherence monitoring, alerts to caregivers, and follow‐up intervention(s) from personal and/or professional caregivers as needed. The hypothesis to be tested in this 2 year SBIR Phase I work plan is that the eMMp will significantly im‐prove adherence and clinical outcome (blood pressure control) in a population of frail elderly who are hyper‐tensive. SBIR Phase II will determine the minimum level of intervention needed to achieve sustained medication adherence and control of blood pressure in a larger group of hypertensive elders.

AB: Rationale: There are a number of barriers to executing large‐scale randomized controlled trials, including cost, complexity, and regulatory requirements. It is estimated that approximately 40% of the average clinical trial costs for all Phase II or Phase III trials are dedicated to source document verification (SDV). We hypothesized that SDV via remote access, using existing technologies that support secure off‐site electronic health record (EHR) access, is feasible and non‐inferior to traditional on‐site SDV. Methods: A total of 4 hospitals from the NIH sponsored ARDS network, a multi‐center network that conducts clinical trials for patients with acute lung injury, assisted with this study. First, we conducted pre‐study activities to obtain remote access to all required systems. Next, we instituted pre‐study pilot testing to ensure that the EHR could be accessed remotely and to develop standard stopping procedures when searching for a data element, how to account for work breaks, interruptions, and when to call for additional help from the local site managers. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of pre‐visit remote SDV compared to traditional on‐site SDV. This was accomplished by randomizing a convenience sample of all study subjects who were due for an upcoming monitoring visit. Results: Fourteen study subjects were randomized to either remote SDV or traditional on‐site SDV. Of the 2965 variables in the remote source document verification arm for the adult network, only 14 variables (0.47%) could not be located remotely but were located during the on‐site visit. The variables that were missing remotely did not represent a systemic issue but were randomly spread across the data fields. Three variables (0.10%) in the on‐site only group also required help from the on‐site study coordinator (Table 1). There was a consistent trend for more time (in minutes) consumed per data item (0.50 vs. 0.39) and time per case report form (4.60 vs. 3.60) using remote SDV although the observed differences were not statistically significant (Table 2). Conclusions: Ninety‐nine percent of the SDV variables were successfully accessed remotely and there was no difference in time to complete the source document verification in the remote group when compared to the in‐site group. This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of a remote monitoring system. While this study only addressed remote monitoring for SDV purposes, the opportunity exists to encompass additional features of study monitoring such as study drug accountability, consent documentation, and basic regulatory documentation and training.

AB: After obtaining informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned to receive their follow‐up care via telemedicine or in‐office visits. All subjects will complete a MIDAS questionnaire and allodynia questionnaire at their initial visit. Follow‐up visits will be scheduled at 4‐6 weeks, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. In‐person follow‐up visits will be conducted in the standard fashion of the current physician's practice, with the initial intake conducted by an ophthalmic technician or resident, followed by the physician visit. Telemedicine visits will be conducted by the physician and recorded. Similar information will be gathered in both groups including: current medications, interim medical and headache history (including visits to the ED or hospitalizations for headache), description of headache, response to treatment (including adverse reactions), allergies, blood pressure and weight. Subjects randomized to telemedicine will be asked to have their blood pressure and weight measured within 5 days of their telemedicine session at a location convenient to them. We will record the length of each visit. Subjects in the in‐person group, will be queried about travel time, and the total amount of time for the visit, and any activities missed to attend the visit. We will also ask about other costs associated with attending the office visit, such as child care. At the one‐year follow‐up visit, subjects will complete the MIDAS, allodynia questionnaire, Modified Group Health Association of America's Consumer Satisfaction scale, and have the opportunity to express their views on the aspect of care received in a semi‐structured interview. The follow‐up questionnaires may be completed on line (telemedicine group, optional for in‐person group) or on paper (in‐person group). Headache diaries will be provided on line or may be done on paper, a smartphone, or a computer program of the subject's choosing. All subjects will be able to access the physician by telephone, using MyChart, or with additional non‐study visits as needed. Subjects will be responsible for the cost of the medications, treatments prescribed, and laboratory monitoring needed for their condition. Support staff will be available to help set up the video system for subjects assigned to the telemedicine group who are in need of assistance.

AB: Background: Previous publications have shown beneficial effects of direct current (DC) electrical cardioversion (ECV) in hospitalised patients, or at the emergency department (ED) or at private practice settings on persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) patients performed by different health care professionals. Methods: A prospective study of home‐based DC‐ECV under propofol sedation using Corpuls3 equipment conducted by specialized emergency care practitioners (ECPs) on site supported by well trained and certified sedation practitioners. ECG before and after home DCECV procedure is performed. Synchronized shocks of biphasic energy is applied by deployment of a maximum of four shocks of 200 Joules each with the electrode position placed at the anterolateral (AL) (= anterior‐apex (AA)) site. Bedside monitoring and telephone consultation by an onduty cardiologist and anesthesiologist is provided. Followup period of 6 weeks will be encountered comprising telephone and, when needed, personal contacts at 4 and 24 hours to monitor the recurrence of AF, complications and adverse events. Endpoints: in this observational feasibility and safety study of 30 adult patients the (a) feasibility endpoint is completion of cardioversion (% of study patients with a recurrence in whom a home cardioversion is performed, i.e. to whom at least one DC countershock was administered while the patient was under sedation); (b) safety endpoint: a composite of MACCE occurring within 24 hours (subdivided in early MACCE, i.e. during one hour observation period and late MACCE, i.e. thereafter up till 24 hours). Secondary endpoints: MACCE occurring during 6 weeks follow‐up; any hospitalisation and all‐cause mortality during 6 weeks follow‐up; number (%) of patients in sinus rhythm at the end of the procedure; idem at the end of 6 weeks follow‐up. Design: The study is designed as a pilot, open‐label, noncontrolled, non‐randomised, single centre clinical study. The RACE‐6 study is a prospective observational community study which will be carried out in the Netherlands by welltrained ECPs, initiated and coordinated by Ambulance Oost, Hengelo at the East region of the Netherlands in cooperation with Hospital Group Twente, University of Twente, Maastricht University Medical Centre and University Medical Centre Groningen. Hypothesis: Home DC‐ECV in (adult) general population patients with an episode of symptomatic recurrent persistent AF, carried out by ECPs, is feasible, safe, preferred by patients and is associated with reduced costs. Expected results: The study will provide an answer for the feasibility of home DC‐ECV. In addition, the safety, patient preference and the cost‐effectiveness relationship of home versus hospital DC‐ECV will be explored.

TI: Feasibility of Telehealth Problem-Solving Therapy for Depressed Homebound Older Adults
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct00903019
YR: 2009
AB: Older people with disabilities who cannot leave their homes are at increased risk of depression or depressive symptoms. Short‐term psychotherapy, without medications, has been found effective for treating this population of people. Problem‐solving therapy (PST) is a brief, structured, cognitive‐behavioral therapy that teaches people problem‐solving and coping skills to deal with negative life events and daily problems. Previous research demonstrated that PST is an effective treatment for depression when delivered to older adults in their homes. The cost of service for these in‐home visits, however, can be prohibitive for many older adults and social service providers. One way to extend treatment to more older adults is to deliver PST via teleconferencing (tele‐PST). This study will test the feasibility and effectiveness of tele‐PST in treating depression in homebound older adults. This study will have two phases. Phase 1 will examine the feasibility of delivering treatment via teleconference. Participants in this phase will receive six weekly sessions of tele‐PST and then complete a 2‐week follow‐up visit in which their depression, disability, and resourcefulness will be assessed. Logistical and procedural problems and acceptability of the treatment to participants will be used to guide modifications or adaptations made to tele‐PST before conducting a larger, randomized trial in Phase 2. Participation in Phase 2 will last 6 weeks, with follow‐up visits lasting until 24 weeks after the conclusion of treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: tele‐PST, in‐person PST, and attention control. Participants in the tele‐PST group will receive six weekly sessions of PST via teleconference, and participants in the in‐person PST group will receive six weekly sessions of PST from a study therapist in person. Both these groups will also receive six monthly maintenance calls from their study therapist after the completion of treatment. Participants in the attention group will receive six weekly phone calls followed by six monthly phone calls to monitor their health. All participants in Phase 2 will complete assessments at 2, 12, and 24 weeks following their treatment. These assessments will measure the adequacy of recruitment, enrollment, and retention strategies; the compliance rates and service delivery costs of tele‐PST and in‐person PST; and participants' depression, disability, and resourcefulness.

KY: Mental Disorders; Psychotic Disorders
AB: The overarching aim of this study is to evaluate whether telehealth leads to better mental health outcomes and decreased use of acute and crisis‐based mental health care services by randomly assigning 300 people with serious mental illness (SMI) and psychiatric instability receiving services at 1 of 2 community mental health centers (CMHCs), each of which offers integrated behavioral and primary health care, to either Health Home Usual Care alone or telehealth plus Health Home Usual Care for 12 months, with assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an automated, algorithmically‐driven, customizable telehealth platform that provides education, teaches illness self‐management, prompts users to enact coping strategies, and monitors symptoms on a daily basis to remotely detect early warning signs among people with SMI, moving beyond the existing telehealth approaches (mainly educational websites and videoconferencing) for assessing and providing education and therapy to people with SMI. This study has two specific aims. Aim 1 is to compare the effectiveness of telehealth with Health Home Usual Care by measuring improvements at 6 and 12 months in illness self‐management, psychiatric symptoms, and health self‐efficacy. Aim 2 is to compare the effectiveness of telehealth with Health Home Usual Care by comparing total cost of emergency room visits and hospital days during the 12 months prior to baseline to total costs of emergency room visits and hospital days during the 12 months after baseline. This study will evaluate a widely used automated telehealth program that has been modified and upgraded by the research team to incorporate curriculum drawn from illness self‐management interventions for SMI developed by the investigators (i.e., Integrated Illness Management and Recovery (I‐IMR) and HOPES). Unlike other telehealth devices, it does not require an internet connection and is an efficient and innovative way to provide illness self‐monitoring and self‐management education. Responses are entered by the user and forwarded to a secure server via cellular signal. The telehealth specialist will access the server daily through a secure website using a username and password.

AB: Background: Reduced all‐cause and heart failure rehospitalisation rates have been demonstrated when adding Structured Telephone Support (STS) to face‐to‐face chronic heart failure (CHF) management programs, but we are yet to understand its benefit to the full spectrum of issues experienced, resulting inequity of care. Aim: To examine the nature of hybrid STS provided to patients determined to be at the highest risk of deterioration (indicated by a red or red/crisis flag) and hospital burden, in a multicentre, randomised trial of standard versus intensified management (the WHICH? II Trial). Methods: Baseline profiling data used to categorise trial patients as low (GREEN), medium (AMBER), or high (RED) risk for recurrent morbidity and mortality via the novel GARDIAN‐HF stratification tool were analysed. Results: 328 trial participants (mean age 75±11 years, 42% female and 15% living remotely) were studied. The majority (57%) had CHF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (mean 31±9.4%). Delineation of increased risk was facilitated by determining holistic/socio‐demographic factors (22% had self‐care deficits), management deficits (46%) and clinical instability at index hospitalisation (91%) then at 7‐14 days (48%) which was indicative of the need for increased surveillance/ support. GARDIAN‐HF profiling indicated that 4.3% (GREEN), 29% (AMBER) and 67% (RED status) were at low, medium and high risk of poor outcomes. Subsequently, the STS team made 5754 structured telephone calls (62% capture, mean 12 minutes), assessing self‐reported stability of overall health, heart failure symptoms, adherence and hospitalisation since they had last spoken to the telephone nurses. Consequently 35% of patients required no action, 53% had issues requiring monitoring, and 12% given a red flag indicating new instability requiring an immediate action by the faceto‐face team. 57/567 (1%) red flag calls were determined a red/crisis flag (an even higher priority) and highest rehospitalised (22%). Conclusion: Appropriate referral following hybrid STS may result in improved access.

AB: INTERVENTION: Patients will be randomized 1:1 into control and telemonitoring groups (73 in each group). The participants will be block randomized (blocks of 4) and stratified into groups according to their primary condition (HF, COPD, hypertension, and CKD). The HF group will further be stratified based on NYHA classification (NYHA class 2‐3, NYHA class 4), and the hypertensive patients will be stratified to those with and those without diabetes. To perform the randomization, the online computer generated randomization tool, Research Randomizer, will be used (www.randomizer.org). The study coordinator performing the recruitment will be blinded until the patient has consented to participate. The telemonitoring technology will enable patients with complex chronic illnesses, including multiple chronic conditions, to take clinically relevant physiological measurements with wireless home medical devices and to answer symptom questions on the mobile phone. The measurements will be automatically and wirelessly transmitted to the mobile phone and then to a data server. Specifically, patients with HF will monitor daily weight and blood pressure/heart rate, CKD patients will monitor blood pressure, and HF, COPD, and CKD patients will monitor symptoms. Hypertension patients will monitor their blood pressure. Automated self‐care instructions/messages that have been carefully developed with healthcare specialists will be sent to the patient based on the readings and reported symptoms. If there are signs of their status deteriorating, an alert will be sent to a clinician that is responsible for the particular chronic condition of concern (i.e., in the specific specialty clinic). The clinicians will have all the relevant patient data sent to them and will be able to access (through a secure web portal) to view historical and trending data for their patients.

AB: Background/Objective: Breast surgeons play an active role in genetic counseling and testing of both affected and unaffected patients at increased risk for breast cancer. Traditionally, NCCN guidelines have been the primary reference for selecting appropriate patients to test for hereditary breast cancer. The recent lower cost of testing and the availability of multigene panels have increased the willingness of patients to be tested. We undertook a study to determine the current genetic testing practices of community breast surgeons and the impact of physician access to remote genetic counselor (GC) consultation. While the goal of this study was to understand if physician access to remote clinical consultation with a genetic counselor would impact identification of candidates for testing, incidental findings raise the question about the current validity of NCCN guidelines. Results indicate that the use of traditional NCCN guidelines may underestimate those at risk for deleterious mutations. Methods: A multi‐center prospective data collection was performed that included 14 community‐based breast cancer physicians experienced with genetic counseling and testing. Patients were identified as candidates for genetic testing based on patient's perceived and actual risk for hereditary breast cancer as part of standard of care. Surveys were completed before and after testing. Surveys included questions about utilization of guidelines and test results. A standard pricing fee regardless of panel size or genes selected were employed for this study, which eliminated cost as an issue in gene panel selection. Results: A total of 249 patients were tested, with a median age of 51. Risk assessment for breast cancer and genetic mutations was done on 97% of patients utilizing various models including Tyrer‐Cusick, BRCAPRO, Hughes Risk App, and NCCN guidelines. Genetic testing was considered because of a recent diagnosis of breast cancer (61%), to guide treatment decisions (42%), and/or strong family history of breast cancer (69%). Patients met NCCN guidelines for genetic testing 66% of the time, and the majority of patients (55%) were tested for > 20 genes (3% BRCA1/2 only testing). Patients under 50 had deleterious mutations 14.7% of the time; patients over 50, 12.6% of the time. In patients < 50 there was a higher percentage of patients with BRCA1/2 mutations (47% vs 37.5%). Looking at the entire group, 14% had a positive result for a deleterious mutation, 26% had a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), and 61% were negative. The most common positive findings were BRCA1, BRCA2, and CHEK2. Among the patients who met NCCN criteria for testing, 12.7% had deleterious mutations (50% of which were BRCA1/2), while of patients who did not meet NCCN criteria, 11.3% had deleterious mutations (33% of which were BRCA1/2). Conclusions: Patients who did not meet NCCN genetic testing guidelines had a similar percentage of deleterious mutations as the patients who met the guidelines. This could be partially accounted for by the expanded numbers of genes tested since there were a higher number of BRCA1/2 deleterious mutations in the patients who met the guidelines. With the decrease in testing costs, perhaps guidelines for genetic testing should be re‐evaluated, expanded, or completely removed. The downstream benefit to the many relatives of an affected individual should also be a consideration. A large study testing all patients who present with breast cancer is underway.

YR: 2008
CC: Back and Neck
KY: Back Pain
AB: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a major medical problem for the VA, affecting up to 15% of all veterans in primary care. Furthermore, prior surveys indicate CLBP is a leading cause of medical discharge of active duty personnel, and of medical disability costs. Given current demands on military personnel it is likely the burden of chronic pain will increase. The VA has adopted the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Guidelines for evaluation of back pain but these guidelines do not provide specifics for true rehabilitation. It is acknowledged that most back pain patients are not surgical candidates, that medications provide only limited analgesia, and that symptom control and improved function require a comprehensive approach addressing the cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects of chronic pain. Fortunately, structured, specific interventions to both address the multidimensional nature of pain and operationalize treatment principles in primary care settings are available. These interventions, which reflect the VA emphasis on patient‐centered care, can be effective in reducing disability and pain, but are a frequently overlooked component of effective care. One reason is that most clinics lack appropriately trained psychologists. Moreover, even when specialists are available, the prevailing clinic‐based service model is either too resource‐intensive, or presents barriers to access. One approach to addressing some these barriers is the use of "telehealth" outreach. Studies in diverse medical disorders and some chronic pain syndromes suggest that care can be delivered efficiently and effectively with minimal therapist contact in home‐based treatment models, using telephone consultation to replace clinic visits. These approaches are fully congruent with recent VA telehealth initiatives to improve access and cost efficiency. In VA Pain Clinic settings our face‐to‐face, 8‐week, 8‐hours contact time Cognitive Behavioral Self‐Management Skills Training (CBSST) program appears to be effective in reducing disability and pain, and improving mood in chronic back pain. Given the scarcity of specialized psychologists, a second approach is to train non‐specialists (eg, primary care medical nurse personnel) instead of psychologists to deliver treatment, to help improve access to the intervention. We conducted two double blind, randomized assignment, two‐arm, parallel groups, six‐month clinical trials. Patients with CLBP were recruited from VA San Diego primary care clinics and the community. Participants received either CBSST or Rogerian Psychotherapy in a home‐based, telephone‐ delivered format for a total of 10 hours of therapist contact time. The methodological difference between the two studies was the discipline of the interventionist. In Study 1 the intervention was delivered by a psychologist with specific training in cognitive behavioral therapy; in Study 2 the intervention was was done by a medical primary care nurse who had been trained to deliver a version of CBSST modified to be suitable for delivery by an individual without specific expertise in cognitive behavioral therapy. The control condition was a supportive psychotherapy, again suitably modified in the case of the medical nurse interventionist. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at end of treatment, and at one, three and six months post‐treatment. The primary data analytic strategy was an intent‐to‐treat analysis (last observation carried forward) of all participants as randomized. The primary end point was physical function (Roland & Morris Disability) at end of 8‐week treatment; secondary end points were pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale) and patient‐reported clinical global impression of change. The aim of the research was to develop more accessible and more cost‐efficient back pain treatment. Key Words: Back Pain, Cognitive‐Behavioral Treatment, Clinical Trial

KY: Chronic Disease
AB: Advances in medical technology and more effective treatment for life‐limiting illness have allowed children with complex chronic conditions to survive not only the neonatal period but also their adolescent years, with an ever‐increasing number living well into adulthood. Often their families are not well prepared or supported. Currently, outpatient pediatric health care services are designed primarily for episodic diagnosis and treatment of acute diseases, and are not designed to provide holistic, comprehensive, family‐center care that is directed at improving the quality of life of these children and their families. There is usually no mechanism for effective coordination between subspecialists. As a result, care is fragmented, redundant, inefficient, and very costly. Despite their small number, this population accounts for a disproportionate amount of the costs associated with pediatric medicine. Furthermore, current services are rarely comprehensive and some services such as pain‐management, sleep‐management, life‐span palliative care, and psychosocial and behavioral interventions (including transition to adult medicine) are often inconsistently accessible or non‐existent. The investigators plan to enroll 450 patients into this study, randomizing about half to the new care at Children's Comprehensive Care (CCC) and half to a control group which continues in the care that they are currently receiving. If they are randomized to the intervention group, the child will receive primary care, including preventative care, acute care, well checks, and immunizations from CCC. If this child is hospitalized at Dell Children's Medical Center (not including day surgery procedures), a practitioner from CCC will visit the child shortly after admission and collaborate with the hospital team to coordinate care at discharge. In addition, CCC will coordinate and monitor all other aspects of the child's medical, dental, behavioral, and developmental care, including the development of individualized care plans that are reviewed annually or with change of medical status, and implemented and maintained by CCC. Other changes to care delivery include access to embedded palliative, developmental, and behavioral care; use of a consultant‐model for specialist care; use of telemedicine, greater use of care coordination and case management; and, holistic care of child and family‐including psycho‐social screening and referral. CCC will use Social Workers, Registered Nurse (RN) Case‐managers, and a Child Life Specialist to offer more holistic care coordination, family support, and case‐management. If they are randomized to the control group they will continue in whatever type care they are currently being treated and will be given no clinical intervention by Children's Comprehensive Care. The investigators' goal is to evaluate whether children who are patients at Children's Comprehensive Care receive better care or not, as defined by cost and utilization, parent‐report for quality and satisfaction, and impact‐on‐family. Cost and Utilization matrices include‐hospitalizations, Emergency Department (ED) visits, and specialist visits within the Seton system of care (locally, Dell Children's Hospital, a member of the Seton Healthcare Family is the only Children's hospital in the Austin area.) Investigators will also evaluate quality and satisfaction using the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare and System (CAHPS) 12‐Month Survey with Patient‐Centered Medical Home (PCMH), and impact‐on‐family using the PedsQL Family Impact Module (version 2.0). This study will seek to analyze three years worth of data.

AB: BACKGROUND: The obesity epidemic has major public health consequences. Expert dietetic and behavioural counselling with intensive follow‐up is effective, but resource requirements severely restrict widespread implementation in primary care, where most patients are managed. We aimed to estimate the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of an internet‐based behavioural intervention (POWeR+) combined with brief practice nurse support in primary care. METHODS: We did this pragmatic, parallel‐group, randomised controlled trial at 56 primary care practices in central and south England. Eligible adults aged 18 years or older with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) or more (or ≥28 kg/m(2) with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, or diabetes) registered online with POWeR+‐a 24 session, web‐based, weight management intervention lasting 6 months. After registration, the website automatically randomly assigned patients (1:1:1), via computer‐generated random numbers, to receive evidence‐based dietetic advice to swap foods for similar, but healthier, choices and increase fruit and vegetable intake, in addition to 6 monthly nurse follow‐up (control group); web‐based intervention and face‐to‐face nurse support (POWeR+Face‐to‐face [POWeR+F]; up to seven nurse contacts over 6 months); or web‐based intervention and remote nurse support (POWeR+Remote [POWeR+R]; up to five emails or brief phone calls over 6 months). Participants and investigators were masked to group allocation at the point of randomisation; masking of participants was not possible after randomisation. The primary outcome was weight loss averaged over 12 months. We did a secondary analysis of weight to measure maintenance of 5% weight loss at months 6 and 12. We modelled the cost‐effectiveness of each intervention. We did analysis by intention to treat, with multiple imputation for missing data. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN21244703. FINDINGS: Between Jan 30, 2013, and March 20, 2014, 818 participants were randomly assigned to the control group (n=279), the POWeR+F group (n=269), or the POWeR+R group (n=270). Weight loss averaged over 12 months was recorded in 666 (81%) participants. The control group lost almost 3 kg over 12 months (crude mean weight: baseline 104·38 kg [SD 21·11; n=279], 6 months 101·91 kg [19·35; n=136], 12 months 101·74 kg [19·57; n=227]). The primary imputed analysis showed that compared with the control group, patients in the POWeR+F group achieved an additional weight reduction of 1·5 kg (95% CI 0·6‐2·4; p=0·001) averaged over 12 months, and patients in the POWeR+R group achieved an additional 1·3 kg (0·34‐2·2; p=0·007). 21% of patients in the control group had maintained a clinically important 5% weight reduction at month 12, compared with 29% of patients in the POWeR+F group (risk ratio 1·56, 0·96‐2·51; p=0·070) and 32% of patients in the POWeR+R group (1·82, 1·31‐2·74; p=0·004). The incremental overall cost to the health service per kg weight lost with the POWeR+ interventions versus the control strategy was £18 (95% CI ‐129 to 195) for POWeR+F and ‐£25 (‐268 to 157) for POWeR+R; the probability of being cost‐effective at a threshold of £100 per kg lost was 88% and 98%, respectively. No adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Weight loss can be maintained in some individuals by use of novel written material with occasional brief nurse follow‐up. However, more people can maintain clinically important weight reductions with a web‐based behavioural program and brief remote follow‐up, with no increase in health service costs. Future research should assess the extent to which clinically important weight loss can be maintained beyond 1 year.

AB: Chronic illnesses, such as asthma, diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension, represent a significant burden of disease Chronic diseases also impose huge costs on the health care systems responsible for managing them as well as their significance for those affected. Non‐pharmacological treatment is mandatory for type 2 diabetes patients characterized by central obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and overeating (1). Secondary failure to reach treatment goals despite an extensive National diabetes rehabilitation program in Denmark is often seen (2). Outpatient control shows positive effects on outpatient rehabilitation (3) reducing HbA1c, weight, and blood pressure. However, some patients never accomplish good diabetes regulation and in others regulation deteriorates over time. New approaches are required and need testing to motivate and give feedback to the patients at home. Telemedicine has the capacity to achieve this, where a diabetic nurse may optimize motivation, treatment, and diet through direct feedback adapted to milieu of the patient in accordance with a potential spouse. Good metabolic control is important as diabetes is inevitable a factor for increased risk of cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and nephropathy (4). The quality of life and reduction in work ability is affected, thus, life expectancy is shortened by 6‐8 years. Multi‐factorial intervention may delay this (5). The high incidence of the serious implications strengthens the importance of achieving good metabolic control through lifestyle changes. Health education shows reduction in cardiovascular risk factors (6‐8), which often disappears after the end of the intervention (6‐8). Good self‐care and compliance improve the outcome and reduces diabetes complications (9) and we need new tools to achieve higher attendance to the National diabetes program. Telemedicine represents a novel tool of educating and controlling chronic diseases. It reduced HbA1c for five years with in trials designed to test video‐conferencing, clinical data entry and review, web‐based education materials, and monitored chat groups (10). Home telemonitoring was compared with telephone calls reducing the HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetes (11) and the technology confer a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c of 0.5 % when applied as add‐on to standard treatment. It was used adjunctively to a broader telemedicine initiative for adults with diabetes. The largest telemedicine study initiated by the Ministry of Health in England (Whole Systems Demonstrator) randomized 3320 patients [12] with heart failure and diabetes to telemedicine care. It showed that the telemedicine intervention as add‐on therapy resulted a statistically significant reduction in mortality from 8.3% versus 4.6%. Similarly, it showed a reduction of number of inpatients and the number of bed days by 11% and 14%, respectively. The patients' health‐related quality of life was unchanged. The savings was less than the additional cost of using telemedicine and overall it cost 15% more per patient. This point at two important factors when applying telemedicine solutions: First, it should preferably replace the standard care and not add‐on and, second, be based on the patient's own computer, tablet or smartphone, all of which will reduce the cost substantially. Telemedicine is available for 98‐99% of all inhabitants in Denmark by broadband, which allows video conference at home. A few randomized trials with this technology are available at present. We aimed at implementing a telemedicine model in our setting and the design and method should evaluate the quality of treatment as well as technical problems and replace the standard treatment. Aim: We compared clinical data from a telemedicine group with a standard care group treated by the same medical algorithm. We wanted to reduce the barriers for the use of a home monitoring and ‐treatment among elderly, type 2 diabetes patients Hypothesis: Treatment by telemedicine or standard care in type 2 diabetes patients results in similar clinical HbA1c, blood pressure, and lipids. Materials and methods: Individually visits at the outpatient clinic to plan improvement of glycemic control were made before information of the study was given. Individual goals of the treatment and the drugs needed to fulfil the objectives were agreed on. The patients received the information for the study, and if they wanted to participate, they signed an approval of participation and randomization was performed. All medical treatment, control of blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, and education was executed via videotelephone in the telemedicine group In the control group patients attended usual procedure in the outpatient clinic with regular visits. Summary of recommendations for glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control for the participants were: HbA1c 6.5‐7.5% (48‐58 mmol/L) , fasting blood glucose 6.5‐7.5 mmol/l, diurnal blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg, LDL‐cholesterol <100 mg/dL (<2.5 mmol/L) and start of medication with elevated urinary albumin/creatinine excretion ≥30 (μg/mg). The treatment algorithm was lifestyle adjustment plus antidiabetic drugs described elsewhere. When the goals were reached within 3 weeks, the videotelephone was disconnected and patients were encouraged to continue glycemic control at their general practitioner. A videotelephone in the telemedicine group was delivered and serviced by the Danish Tele Company. The trial included type 2 diabetes patients allocated from October 2011 until July 2012 referred to the outpatient clinic from general practitioners. At entry, all patients were screened by albumin/creatinine excretion rate, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram, lipid profile, diabetic food control, and arteriosclerotic symptoms (angina pectoris, claudication, and fatigue). Diurnal blood pressure was measured by monitors.

AB: This research project first aims to compare the effects of high‐intensity individualized group‐based core stability training (GroupCoreSIT) for people with MS with standard care in the primary health care focusing on balance, walking, ADL, quality of life and cost‐effectiveness. Secondly, the project aims to investigate patients' experiences from participating in the intervention and in standard care, particularly addressing reflections regarding content, relevance and feasibility, changes in ADL, continuity of care, self‐management. The third aim is to investigate how the PTs act and interact with the group while conducting the intervention, particularly how individualization is carried out, and the PTs' reflections from participating in the education and performance of the intervention. Finally, changes in patients' pathways and coordination represent another main objective of this project. The RCT: hypothesis, study outcomes and measures: High‐intensity individualised group‐based core stability training performed at the municipal PTs' facilities, complemented by home exercises, will improve balance, walking, ADL, quality of life and cost‐effectiveness. This is reflected in the primary and secondary outcomes. RCT will be conducted in collaboration with the outpatient clinic for people with MS at the Nordland Hospital Trust, Bodø, together with six municipalities in Nordland County. The municipalities are included: Bodø, Rana, Meløy, Rødøy, Vågan and Fauske. The out‐patient clinic agreed to recruit the participants by sending a written invitation to people with MS in the selected municipalities, fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Six PTs with expertise in neurological physiotherapy agreed to conduct the intervention. These PTs will attend a four days practical and theoretical training on the intervention, with 1‐2 follow up videoconferences during the study. A prospective RCT will be conducted, in which 72 persons with MS will participate, undergo a 6‐week intervention, and be followed up for 6 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to two arms in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the intervention arm A will be offered individualised group‐based core stability training termed GroupCoreSIT at the PTs facilities, complemented with home exercises. Participants in the control arm B will be offered standard care. Significant improvements in outcomes are expected for the intervention arm compared to standard care. Randomisation will be stratified by European Disability Score Scale (EDSS) to minimize selection bias and preserve homogeneity between arms. Randomisation and data collation will be performed using Remote Data Entry (WebCRF), an Internet‐based solution developed by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The researchers aim to recruit all subjects within 5 months. After enrolment, the PTs responsible for performing the intervention, will conduct an individual assessment of the participants in arm A as a basis for individualisation in the group based intervention. Each training group will consist of three participants. The training sessions will last for 60 minutes, performed three days per week, for six weeks, between 10 am and 5 pm. A total of 32 exercises with up to 5 levels of difficulty are described and illustrated by photos, will be available in an "exercise bank". 10‐12 repetitions for each exercise with good quality of movement will be performed. Every session will end with active stretching/active relaxation and instructions for home exercises. The participants will perform 30‐minute of exercises, optional to divide into smaller intervals, at home two days per week when there are no organized group training. Intervention arm A: the participants will perform the training program: GroupCoreSIT in the facilities of the municipal physiotherapist. Control arm B: the participants in the control group will receive standard care, i.e. following their ordinary physiotherapy services and/or routines/activities. Procedures and tests The trial will be restricted to patients who have volunteered and provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Ethics Committee procedures. At enrolment, a neurologist will do the EDSS screening, medical history, type of MS and medications. An appropriately trained PT, also blinded to the arm membership, will perform a standardized assessment for all the participants using relevant tests and provide the activity monitor. The following baseline information will be collected and then inserted electronically in the WebCRF system used also to randomize the patients: 1. Medical history, type of MS, EDSS, age, gender, weight, height, medications, physiotherapy during the previous 6 months. 2. Two primary outcomes measuring balance in sitting, standing and walking. 3. Nine secondary outcomes measuring balance, waling, activities of daily living (ADL), quality of life and physical activity At 1 week, 3 months and 6 months post intervention all the participants will undergo the same standardized assessment performed at baseline. Exercise, activity and disease monitoring On a weekly basis all the participants will record: changes in medication, general wellbeing (qualitative self‐score), exacerbations, and physical activities using a diary. The ActiGraph monitor will be used 1 week prior to intervention, 1 week post intervention and following the 3 and 6 months testing, demonstrated and delivered to the subjects by the test PT. In addition, participants in arm A will record: degree of exhaustion following group sessions (Borg scale) and home exercise completion (in the training diary). An intention‐to‐treat analysis will be performed on all randomised subjects and will serve as the primary analysis for all outcomes in this study. The data analysis will be carried out using SPSS. Possible differences between the groups at baseline will be calculated by using independent sample t‐test for continuous variables and chi‐square for categorical variables. Primary outcomes, changes in balance and walking between the groups will be calculated by using independent sample t‐test. A cost‐utility analysis will be conducted using healthcare system costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). QALYs will be calculated based on the answers of the Health Questionnaire (EQ‐5D‐3L) used to measure changes in patients' quality of life. The incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be computed as differential costs between intervention arm and standard arm over the study period, and differential QALYs. Healthcare utilisation (including hospitalisations, emergency department admissions, outpatients visits, examinations, primary care visits, rehabilitation) and related costs will be collected through the hospitals' electronic patient journal (DIPS), from the Norwegian Patient Registry and The Norwegian Health Economics Administration's (HELFO) system. This secondary outcome will provide relevant knowledge regarding new effective method in organising healthcare services. This can be used as a basis for decision making regarding large‐scale implementation of rehabilitation. Patients' experiences: The patients' experiences with the intervention will be examined through qualitative research interviews. The interviews will be conducted on a sample of 8‐10 participants from the intervention and the control arm twice; at the end of intervention and 6 months post intervention. In accordance with qualitative methods, the researchers will select the sample strategically to promote breadth and variety of data production. Variation in training groups, EDSS, age, gender and time since diagnosis are considered to be important. The interviews will take place in participants' homes or another convenient place in their municipality. The interview topics include: the first assessment/consultation, the group situation, content of training, intensity/quantity, pros and cons, home‐exercises and ADL. The same number of subjects from the control group will be interviewed regarding their experiences with standard care, investigating the same topics. In order to provide insight into the users' experiences beyond the intervention period the scope for the second interviews is: retrospective reflections regarding wellbeing and coping with ADL in the period before, during and after the intervention, self‐management, and continuity of care, pros and cons regarding the intervention and standard care. A theme‐based interview guide will be used as well as audio recordings of the interviews. The material will be transcribed and analyzed using Systematic Text Condensation applying phenomenology of the body, enactive theory complemented by neurosciences as a theoretical framework. Physiotherapists' performance of intervention and experiences: What the PTs emphasize in their individual assessment prior to the first group session will be investigated through observation and videotaping of the assessment of one patient in each training group (12 observations). These observations will be complemented by qualitative research interview with the actual PT (12 interviews) to illuminate the PTs' reflections regarding the assessment, planning of the group sessions, choices of exercises and goals for the individual. To investigate how the PTs' tailor the intervention in situ, how they act and interact with the participants, one session in each group will be observed and videotaped (12 observations). To illuminate the PTs' reflections regarding education in the intervention, experiences from conducting it, particularly focusing on considerations regarding goal attainment, individualization in a group setting and home exercises, the PTs will be interviewed at the end of each training group period (12 interviews). An observation guide, a hand held video‐camera and a theme‐based interview guide will be used as well as audio recordings of the interviews. The material will be transcribed and analysed using Systematic Text Condensation applying phenomenology of the body, enactive theory complemented by neurosciences and practice knowledge as a theoretical framework. Changes in patient's pathway and coordination of care: In 2007 The Northern Norway Regional Health Authority (Helse Nord RHF) reported 650 persons with MS, the selected outpatient clinic has 300 persons enrolled, and prevalence and incidence in Nordland County have recently increased to a high risk area for MS. Courses for newly diagnosed persons have priority in the specialist care and current offer of complex rehabilitation, included high intensity physiotherapy is provided by the rehabilitation unit at UNN, The Rehabilitation Centre, the Kurbad of North Norway, Valnesfjord Rehabilitation Centre, supplemented by The National Hakadal MS centre. These institutions are currently characterised by long waiting lists. A system for early admission to neurological physiotherapy, and particularly to high intensity programs in the primary health care, is not established within the coordination of care for people with MS. Referral to municipality physiotherapy is not systematic, waiting lists in the primary health care are long, and services are often general and not specifically addressing the needs for people with MS. To explore coordination of care between the outpatient clinics for people with MS and the municipalities regarding high intensity physiotherapy, qualitative interviews will be conducted with selected health personnel (MS‐nurses, neurologists, PTs, a total of 8‐10 subjects) at the hospitals' outpatient clinics and in municipalities (general practitioners, PTs, a total of 8‐10 subjects), before the intervention (for the standard care) and after the RCT (for the new organizational model). The interviews will focus on structures for collaboration and content of service.

AB: Telemedicine is a modern field of clinical medicine that strives to incorporate telecommunication and information technology for diagnosing and managing health care at a distance. Interventions range from telephone reminders to remote physician consultation by streamed by webcam. Simple technology such as telephone and SMS texting are becoming increasingly ubiquitous forms of communication and show potential for clinical benefit for improving patient adherence, as well as promoting education and engagement. Existing research of telephone reminders and family based contracts have been shown to be effective at increasing adherence to treatment sessions such as hemodialysis and improving overall appointment attendance in the outpatient clinical system. Unfortunately, the compliance rates were also found to decrease within a three month period after the intervention was discontinued. The biggest obstacle to a clinic to implementing and maintaining such a system is the costs associated with running the program, primarily the cost of employing staff to make phone calls and continuous follow‐up. Electronic systems to provide reminders to patients at their preferred time, in their preferred format, such as a text message or a phone call. In a study of primary care outpatient appointment attendance, the no show rate was reduced by both electronic reminders by 10%. By cost‐benefit analysis, it was determined to be financially beneficial to generate reminder messages for patients with a no‐show probability of 5%. There is conflicting data of whether a personal call by a clinical staff member or an automatically generated call/text message have greater efficacy of reducing missed appointments, however, both types of reminders were well‐received and did not cause any patient disturbance and automated calls are pose less burden on already‐strained health resources. Although specialized electronic reminder applications via smartphone and tablet devices exist today, both the devices and the skills required to navigate them may be not consistent with the older, chronic disease populations, such as dialysis, congestive heart failure, or COPD. The investigators thereby hypothesize that the simpler Epharmix (EPX) system, which uses the more simple platforms of SMS and phone calls to do automated specialized reminders to be able to reach many of the same benefits of the above electronic systems, at only a fraction of the cost. Besides the purpose of providing timely reminders, the same platform is easily adapted for educational engagement and other clinical goals. In the outpatient epilepsy population, SMS‐based interventions were shown to be feasible and effective at improving patient education and perceptions. Another application of high clinical value is to increase the frequency of physician‐patient contact, via the electronic intervention, and reduce the delay to acquiring critical biometric or clinical data to patients over time. The motivation for this goal comes from several fields in which the shortage of physicians is limiting prompt diagnosis and care. In particular, average wait time for an appointment with a specialist physician, such as a neurologist, is approximately 30 days. In pediatric neurology, the situation is even worse, with an average wait time of 35 days and 39% of children's hospitals reporting a wait time of 12 months or more for new patients to see a neurologist. Psychiatry experiences the same degree of delay. Psychiatric patients have an average wait of 25 days to first appointment. Finally, even generalist practices are overbooked, leading to lack of reporting of falls in geriatric patients until 2‐3 months later [internal data] or congestive heart failure patients waiting 1‐2 months before seeing a physician to report changes in weight or breathing difficulty [internal data]. Given the standard that medication or treatment adjustments that depend on this information must wait for an office visit, the prolonged wait times create a major gap between recognition of symptoms or adverse events, and actual follow up or management. While it is theoretically possible to accelerate a patient's time to drug adjustment or adverse event reporting by calling the physician's office and scheduling an earlier appointment, no data, to these investigators' knowledge, exists on the utilization of such alternative options. Various paper home diaries, such as mood charts in psychiatry, are available to follow patient data; however, there is low compliance that the patient will fill out these charts or bring the diary in for the next visit. Online variants of such diaries have shown almost double the reporting rate. In comparison, more expensive and complicated devices have been developed to address this similar problem. Wearable and implantable EEG‐based seizure monitoring systems are in development, but thus far have only been tested in a few subjects that have a history of refractory epilepsy. Home health weight monitors and other devices are available, but demonstrate high costs and limited broad application, as they are only provided in conjunction with home health care [internal data]. In addition, more complicated telehealth monitoring, asking over 10 questions per call, with multiple triggers actually induces negligible effect on treatment outcomes in patients such as congestive heart failure. In comparison, implantable sensors for CHF have demonstrated increase in patient survival. An electronic intervention platform has been developed by Epharmix, a Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) IDEA Labs (ideas.wustl.edu) team, which has the capacity to use SMS text messaging or pre‐recorded phone messages for various adherence tracking and data collection applications, in order to supplement clinical care. Specific messages include proactively asking patients or a designated patient advocate if the patient has experienced a medical event recently; requesting specific care‐related information, such as glucose values, current mood, or medication adherence; and providing health care education, i.e. what to do if a patient is experiencing physical symptoms. Patients receiving the messages are also provided with key contact information for their designated health care provider to promote patient engagement, as well as prompt and appropriate medical intervention. The service will maintain both a dedicated SMS and phone line for recording events or adverse reactions. Events designated as critical will prompt an immediate phone based follow‐through to the appropriate nursing staff. All recorded events will be available for review by the patient's health care provider. The intervention is designed to reach out to patients, engage patients and providers in communication and allow physicians to respond to concerns more rapidly. This intervention may supplement to the patient‐doctor relationship and potentially improve clinical outcomes, increase adherence, and reduce time to optimal health. Overall, this study aims to determine whether an electronic intervention system, which sends SMS text messages or phone calls proactively can improve medical care outcomes in a variety of healthcare settings. Specifically, the two aims are: 1) To test if Epharmix reminders will improve adherence to physician requested actions, such as appointments, medications, etc. 2) To test if the Epharmix platform can be used to collect clinical data (e.g. weight, blood sugar, disease specific events) over time for later physician analysis. Procedures: Patients at Washington University, Barnes Jewish Hospital and St. Louis Children's Hospital will be included in this study. Two cohorts will be prospectively identified, one group consisting of adult individuals age > 18, and one group of pediatric patients age 5 < 18. Patients from each cohort will be recruited and then randomized to either the experimental or the control group in disease matched control groups. The experimental group will receive the electronic intervention featuring automated SMS text message and/or phone call as described above; the control group will not receive any electronic intervention, or may receive a placebo version of the intervention. Pediatric or geriatric patients may have SMS or phone messages also sent to their designated caregiver. Subjects will have the ability to opt out of the study electronically via text and phone at any point during the study.

KY: Back Injuries; Back Pain; Low Back Pain
AB: Low back injury is one of the most common and disabling disorders in firefighters (IAFF, 2008). Thus, novel interventions are needed to counteract the adverse consequences of this disorder and its impact on firefighter safety. Our long‐term research objective is to develop and test interventions to reduce the incidence, morbidity, economic, and other adverse consequences of low back injury and illness in firefighters. Our previous studies funded by the FEMA Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program demonstrated that: 1) a relationship exists between poor back muscular endurance and increased prevalence of low back pain in firefighters (Verna, 2010); and 2) a worksite intervention including back and core exercise training is safe and effective in improving back and core muscular endurance in firefighters (Mayer, 2015). The purpose of the current study, which builds upon our previous work, is to assess the clinical effectiveness of back and core exercise interventions for low back injury prevention in firefighters. Specific Aims (Purpose) Aim 1. Compare the effectiveness of 2 worksite exercise interventions (supervised, web‐based) relative to control to reduce lost work days related to low back injury and illness in firefighters. Hypotheses: Primary ‐ The supervised exercise intervention will reduce the number of lost work days related to low back injury and illness over the 12‐month intervention period by 40% compared with control. Secondary ‐ The web‐based exercise intervention will reduce the number of lost work days related to low back injury and illness over the 12‐month intervention period by 40% compared with control. No difference between the supervised and web‐based exercise interventions in lost work days will be observed. To test the hypotheses, a 3‐arm, cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in career, full active duty firefighters from 76 stations of 3 fire rescue departments in the Tampa Bay region of Florida. Firefighters (n = 345) will be randomly assigned (by fire station) to 1 of 3 exercise intervention groups ‐ 1) supervised, (n = 115), 2) web‐based (n = 115), or 3) control (n = 115). Participants in the supervised and web‐based exercise groups will perform back and core exercises previously tested in our recent FEMA‐funded grant (EMW‐2009‐FP‐00418), twice per week for 12 months, in addition to their usual physical fitness routine. All participants at a given fire station will receive the same intervention and interventions will be completed during normal shift hours at the fire station. The supervised group will perform back and core exercises with on‐site, 1‐on‐1, direct supervision by certified exercise specialists (e.g. peer fitness trainers from the partner fire departments) for each exercise session using an identical strategy as our previous study. The web‐based group will be provided an interactive web‐based delivery, guidance, and monitoring system for back and core exercises using technology developed by our group and partners, along with remote interaction with and guidance from exercise specialists. The control group will not perform back and core exercises, but will continue their usual physical fitness routine and receive brief education on general exercise and physical activity principles. Outcome measures to test these hypotheses include low back injury and illness data obtained and cross‐checked from various sources, including administrative data (primary outcome), such as reports from the fire departments and workers' compensation data, and participant self‐reported questionnaires in accordance with departmental, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and fire service standards. Numerous other clinically relevant measures for low back pain injury and illness, comorbidities, risk factors, and prognosis will also be collected and analyzed, such as incidence, frequency, severity, chronicity/duration, physical function, psychological measures (e.g. fear avoidance), back and core muscular endurance, body mass index, Functional Movement Screen, physical activity and exercise measures, and cost‐effectiveness. In order to inform implementation efforts throughout the fire service, we will conduct a health economic analysis, such as cost effectiveness, and collect data to gain a better understanding of the context for implementation of the exercise interventions. Potential impact on firefighter health and safety. The proposed study will provide pivotal evidence for dissemination and implementation throughout the fire service. Assuming positive results, this study will deliver an evidence‐based exercise intervention for low back injury prevention specifically for firefighters and assessed in a full‐scale randomized controlled trial.. The innovative, efficient, and effective exercise intervention will reduce the adverse consequences of low back injury and illness in firefighters, and will be ready for national implementation throughout the fire service for fire departments with similar characteristics as those tested. If successfully implemented, this low back injury prevention program will improve firefighter safety and health in order to enhance resilience and preparedness, so they can more effectively carry out their duties to protect the community. Further, this low back injury prevention program will help improve off‐duty and long‐term quality of life for firefighters. Unique contribution to body of knowledge. Knowledge gaps exist in evidence‐based approaches for low back injury prevention in firefighters, particularly regarding interventions for clinical effectiveness, costs, and implementation. The proposed study will assess such an intervention, and is responsive to 4 health and wellness priorities of the 2011 National Fire Service Research Agenda (NFFF, 2011): 1.0: Health and disease related to firefighter wellness and fitness; 3.0: Implementation / translational research; 7.0: Optimization of performance and reducing risk; and 8.0: Cost effectiveness of health and safety systems.

AB: Background Unintended rehospitalizations after surgical procedures represent a large percentage of readmissions and have been associated with increased morbidity and cost of care. Beginning in 2017, Medicare will expand diagnostic categories subject to financial penalties for excess postoperative readmissions to include coronary revascularization procedures. Arrhythmias and pulmonary complications comprise the largest categories for readmission after cardiac surgery. Technologic advances in remote monitoring have led to the use of web‐based digital health kits (DHK) aimed at reducing readmissions and improving postoperative outcomes. The present study was performed to determine the added benefit of incorporating DHK's into a formal readmissions reduction program (RRP) in preventing 30‐d readmissions and to evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the use of these devices. Materials and methods This was a prospective study of all adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution from March 2014 to June 2015. During the study period, 443 adult patients (mean age, 65 +/‐ 14, 33% female) were identified and participated in the formal RRP, 27 of whom also received a DHK after discharge (416 control group). In addition to providing a live video link to a provider specializing in cardiac surgery, the DHK also allowed for automatic daily transmission of weight, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure. Patients also completed a daily health survey targeting symptoms concerning for heart failure, poor wound healing, poor ambulation, and nonadherence to medications. Abnormal vitals or survey responses triggered automatic notifications to the healthcare team. Satisfaction surveys were administered to participants and members of the healthcare team. Pearson chi2 test and the Welch's t‐test were used to assess statistical differences in baseline characteristics and outcome variables. Results During the study period, the readmission rate for the DHK and control groups were similar (7.4% versus 9.9%, P = 0.65). The use of DHKs led to 1649 alerts and 144 interventions, with the highest number of alerts occurring during d 5‐9. The majority of alerts (64%) were prompted by abnormal biometric measurements, and a significant correlation was noted between abnormal biometrics and required intervention (r = 0.62, P < 0.001). No correlation was seen between alerts because of health survey responses (r = 0.07, P = 0.71) or missed check‐ins (r = 0.06, P = 0.76) and required interventions. Poststudy satisfaction surveys showed an overall satisfaction rating of 4.9 +/‐ 0.5 for DHK patients and 4.9 +/‐ 0.2 for members of the care team (scale 1‐5, 5 = agree). Conclusions In our study, adding DHKs to a formal RRP was not associated with a significant decrease in 30‐d readmission rates. We also found that notifications because of abnormal biometric measures were significantly correlated with required interventions. In contrast, notifications due to abnormal health survey responses were not associated with increased interventions. Both patients and members of the healthcare team were highly satisfied with this technology. DHKs appear to extend care beyond the inpatient period and provide a portal for telemonitoring of surgical patients. However, this modality is highly resource intensive and may not significantly reduce readmissions. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of such kits in reducing readmissions and costs of care.

YR: 2008
AB: The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has been shown to be effective in preventing mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmia. However, the expanding indications of this therapy will have an impact on the follow‐up policy. Currently, regular follow‐up visits are scheduled every 3 months. In this context, the recently‐introduced "remote monitoring" devices constitute a promising new technique, allowing to transmit information about the status of the device and ICD therapies, without direct contact between patients and physicians. This monitoring by "tele‐follow‐up" might reduce the cost of care by avoiding useless visits to the implantation centre. The aim of our study is to assess the cost‐benefit ratio of "tele‐follow‐up" assisted care as compared with the conventional ICD follow‐up. Thanks to an open label, randomized, 2 arms study : one using a telephone follow up, the other a conventional follow‐up.

YR: 2011
KY: Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2
AB: Diabetes accounts for an enormous fraction of the cost of health care in the United States and presents a major burden on Military Medical Facilities for care of retirees and dependents. There are insufficient endocrinologists and other diabetes specialists to manage all patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and a significant fraction of these patients have less than optimal control (hemoglobin A1C's [A1Cs] over 7%). Multiple barriers prevent the necessary improvement in glycemic control that would result in savings in lives and costs. The implementation of a telemedicine and web‐based approach for patients to send their blood glucose data which, when combined with relevant laboratory, pharmacy, and A1C targets as set individually for each patient by the Primary Care Physician (PCP), triggers a clinical decision support system (DSS) for the providers can be expected to improve quality of care and efficiency of care. The computer assisted decision support (CADS) system has been integrated with the Comprehensive Diabetes Management Program (CDMP), a web‐based, multi‐platform, interactive patient and provider tool which is currently operative in the Walter Reed Health Care System (WRHCS), Wilford Hall Medical Center (WHMC) at Lackland Air Force Base (AFB), and five community clinics affiliated with the University of Hawaii (UH). This existing infrastructure permits CADS to be tested in a multiple sites that are geographically diverse with diverse patient populations. This study will test the safety and efficacy of CADS as used by PCPs in a multi‐site, ethnically and geographically diverse study in a 12‐month, open, prospective, cluster‐randomized, controlled clinical trial. The specific aims of the study are to: (1) monitor the impact of the intervention on: a) measures of glycemic control, b) the number of diabetes ‐related hospitalizations and emergency room visits, c) the control of co‐morbidities, hyperlipidemia and hypertension, d) the number of clinic visits, e) the change in the patients' quality of life as a result of the intervention; and (2) evaluate the PCPs' satisfaction with the technology. We will employ a cluster‐randomized, controlled, clinical trial involving 30 PCPs who will each recruit approximately 19 patients from their respective geographic site. After completion of recruitment, PCPs and their patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 "treatment" categories: CADS, or "Usual Care". Input data for use by the CADS system will come from the electronic medical record (laboratory and pharmacy data) and from the PCP who will set goals for each individual patient's glycemic control. Patients will upload blood glucose data through a modem to a password‐protected, secure server at least every 2 weeks and receive modification in their treatment regimen at least every three months from their PCP, based in part on the recommendations provided by the CADS system to the PCP. We will compare quantitative outcome measures of glycemic control (the primary outcome is the change in the patient's A1C), blood pressure, and lipid levels from the two treatment groups. In addition, subjective qualitative data from the patients and providers will be obtained.

KY: Stress Disorders, Post‐Traumatic
AB: Background The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides care to 3.3 million Veterans living in rural areas, comprising 36% of all VHA enrollees. In 1995, VHA began expanding its system of Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in order to improve access for the geographically dispersed Veteran population. There are now approximately 900 CBOCs delivering a range of services to approximately 64% of VHA enrollees. While these CBOCs have dramatically improved access to first class primary care services, it has been more challenging to deliver specialty mental health care to rural Veterans. Evidence based specialty mental care practices developed for large VA Medical Centers are often not feasible to deploy in small CBOCs and thus not accessible to rural Veterans. Rural Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treated at CBOCs experience little to no improvement in their symptoms over time. A major contributor of poor PTSD outcomes is that trauma‐focused evidence‐based psychotherapy is not being provided to Veterans in the CBOC setting. Moreover, travel barriers prevent most rural Veterans from receiving trauma‐focused evidence‐based psychotherapy at large VHA Medical Centers (VAMC). Telemedicine Outreach for PTSD (TOP) is a technology‐facilitated virtual care clinical intervention that is designed to enhance access to evidence based psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. The VHA Office of Rural Health and Office of Connected Health and Telehealth Services intend to deploy the TOP intervention nationally. This project will lay the ground work for this national implementation initiative. Specific Aims Impact Goal ‐ The goal of this proposed Type II Hybrid effectiveness‐implementation project is to support the national deployment of the TOP intervention and evaluate its clinical effectiveness in routine care. To achieve this goal, the following three specific aims will be conducted. SPECIFIC AIM 1 ‐ Compare the effectiveness of a standard VA implementation strategy to an enhanced implementation strategy in promoting uptake of TOP. Hypothesis 1 ‐ For sites not meeting the TOP performance metric benchmark with a standard implementation strategy, those randomized to the enhanced implementation strategy will have better reach and engagement outcomes than those randomized to continued standard VA implementation. Reach is defined using two variables: 1) the likelihood of having a care manager encounter and 2) the likelihood of having an evidence based psychotherapy encounter. Engagement is defined using two variables: 1) the likelihood of having 8 care manager encounters and 2) the likelihood of having 8 evidence based psychotherapy encounters. SPECIFIC AIM 2 ‐ Determine if implementation of TOP in routine care improves PTSD outcomes for rural Veterans. Hypothesis 2 ‐Clinical outcomes at sites with higher reach and engagement rates for care manager and evidence based psychotherapy encounters will have better PTSD outcomes and perceived access compared to sites with lower reach and engagement rates and compared to the pre‐implementation period. Hypothesis 3 ‐ Perceived access at sites implementing TOP successfully will be improved compared to sites not implementing TOP successfully and compared to the pre‐implementation period. SPECIFIC AIM 3 ‐ Calculate the cost of the standard and enhanced implementation strategies and estimate the population level cost effectiveness of the enhanced implementation. Methodological Approach Setting ‐ The project will be conducted at 6 VAMCs. CBOCs served by these 6 VAMCs without on‐site psychologists trained in trauma‐focused evidence‐based psychotherapy will be identified and a CBOC or combination of CBOCs with 300‐400 eligible patients will be selected as the implementation site(s). Population (for evaluation) ‐ Using administrative data from VHA's Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW), the investigators will identify all patients at participating CBOCs whose most recent PC‐PTSD screen was positive, had a VHA encounter in the past 12 months with a PTSD diagnosis, and had no specialty mental health encounters at the VAMC in the past 6 months. Eligible patients will be sampled for the evaluation from the selected CBOCs and 100 will be recruited to participate from each VAMC via opt‐out letters. The total anticipated sample size will be 600. Participating patients will complete a baseline survey and 3 follow‐up surveys every 9 months. Local clinicians at implementation sites will have the flexibility to decide who is eligible to receive the TOP clinical intervention, but the investigators expect there will be considerable overlap between those who are eligible for the evaluation and those considered to be eligible for the TOP intervention by local clinicians. Telemedicine Outreach for PTSD (TOP) Intervention ‐ TOP is delivered by a virtual care team comprising a CBOC provider, and a telephone care manager, telepsychologist and telepsychiatrist located at the VAMC. The telephone care manager activities include: education, activation, barrier assessment/resolution, medication adherence and side‐effect monitoring, therapy/homework adherence monitoring and symptom monitoring. The telepsychologist activities include the delivery of trauma‐focused evidence‐based therapy (e.g., Cognitive Processing Therapy [CPT] or Prolonged Exposure Therapy [PE]). The telepsychiatrist activities include conducting case reviews and psychiatric consultations. The core element of the TOP intervention is a case review by the virtual care team (telephone care manager, telepsychologist and telepsychiatrist) of all patients newly enrolled in care management and all those not responding to treatment, along with documentation of the case review in the Electronic Health Record. Given the dynamic nature of technology and the high degree of variability in context across clinics, the investigators will employ methods that enable the new clinical intervention to be adapted from setting to setting and to be refined over time rather than focusing on fidelity to a manualized protocol. The telepsychiatry and telepsychology can either be delivered via interactive video to the CBOC or via clinical video telehealth to home. The Veteran and the telepsychologist can choose to use smartphone apps (CPT Coach or PE Coach) designed to augment these two trauma‐focused evidence‐based therapies. Care managers can also use secure messaging with patients in addition to telephone calls. Standard VA Implementation Strategy ‐ Standard VA implementation strategies will include disseminating a TOP clinical intervention manual, a TOP local champion guide, care manager training materials, PTSD case‐finder tool (with the same inclusion/exclusion criteria used for evaluation sample), and technical support from the facility level telehealth technician. Internal facilitation will be conducted by the designated local champion. In addition, each VAMC will receive funds from the Office of Rural Health to hire a full time telephone care manager for three years devoted to managing CBOC patients with mental health disorders including PTSD. Enhanced VA Implementation Strategy ‐ The enhanced implementation strategy will add external facilitation to the standard VA implementation strategies. External facilitation will begin with an assessment of the current workflow at the VHA Medical Center and the affiliated CBOCs using System Redesign methods. A member of the external facilitation team will conduct site visits at each VAMC and conduct telephone interviews with CBOC staff. The member of the external facilitation team will also collaborate with the local System Redesign staff member. To assess clinical workflow, the investigators will examine the administrative structure of the clinical units, staffing patterns, scopes of practice, service mix, standard operating procedures (e.g., patient check‐in, screening, referrals, coding), job descriptions and annual evaluation criteria, and use of technology including telehealth, eHealth, mHealth, and the electronic health record. For the TOP intervention, key clinical workflow elements include: 1) how patients are referred to the care managers, 2) whether care managers are located at the VISN, VAMC or CBOC and in what administrative unit they are housed, 3) what type of psychotherapy is provided at the CBOC (e.g., anger management, PTSD groups, etc.), 4) formulary restrictions and prescribing patterns, 5) how psychiatric consultations are arranged, 6) how frequently patients are seen in mental health and primary care, caseloads, and wait times, 7) appointment scheduling procedures for mental health and primary care, 8) no show rates, 9) care manager software availability, 10) use of interactive video, clinical video telehealth to home, SmartPhone apps, 10) use of psychiatric rating scales, and 11) how workload credit is distributed. The external facilitation team will then generate a clinical workflow chart that describes the current process of care. With advice from the external facilitation team, the local champion will then incorporate the clinical process of the TOP intervention (including use of technology) into the current clinical workflow chart, making changes to the TOP intervention and/or current clinical workflow as needed. The local champion will also meet monthly with external facilitators to troubleshoot and make refinements. Project Design ‐ A stepped wedge Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design will be used for this Type II Hybrid Effectiveness‐Implementation project. The project will compare implementation outcomes (patient reach) of the standard VA implementation strategy to the implementation outcomes of the enhanced implementation strategy. This design will also allow us to document improvements in perceived access and PTSD outcomes for patients at sites that successfully implement the TOP intervention. The investigators will begin by collecting pre‐implementation access and outcomes data from a sample of patients. In the first implementation step, all six VAMCs will conduct the standard VA implementation strategy at the selected CBOCs for nine months. At the end of the first implementation step, will collect follow‐up data from the sample of patients to assess perceived access, intervention reach, and clinical effectiveness. To conduct the SMART trial design it will be necessary to specify a performance measure benchmark (i.e., tailoring variable) that will be used to determine whether the standard implementation effort is successful. The investigators will define implementation success based on the capacity of the full time care manager to enroll a prespecified number of patients. Specifically, the care manager will report the number of patients enrolled in the care management protocol to the evaluation team and implementation success will be defined as 50 enrolled patients over the 9 month period. If this performance measure benchmark is attained, the VAMC will discontinue the standard VA implementation efforts, but the investigators will continue to collect evaluation data. If the performance measure benchmark is not attained, the VAMC will be randomized to either continued standard VA implementation strategy or the enhanced implementation strategy in the next step. In the second implementation step, these VAMCs will conduct either the standard or enhanced implementation strategy at selected CBOCs for nine months. At the end of the second implementation step, the investigators will again collect follow‐up data from the sample of patients to assess perceived access, intervention reach, and clinical effectiveness. If the performance measure benchmark is attained in the second step at standard or enhanced implementation sites, the VAMC will discontinue implementation efforts. If the performance measure benchmark is not attained at standard implementation sites, the VAMC will receive the enhanced implementation strategy in the next step. If the performance measure benchmark is not attained at enhanced implementation sites, the VAMC will continue to receive enhanced implementation. At the end of the third implementation step, the investigators will again collect follow‐up data from the sample of patients to assess perceived access, intervention reach, and clinical effectiveness. Outcome Measures ‐ The evaluation of the implementation strategies will be based on the RE‐AIM framework. Data will be collected from patient survey and chart review for all patients sampled for the evaluation. The reach implementation outcome measure will be specified as the proportion of sampled patients who received the core element of the TOP intervention (documentation in the electronic health record of a case review of the patient by the virtual care team). This will be assessed by chart review at three time points: 1) 9 month follow‐up, 2) 20 month follow‐up, and 3) 31 month follow‐up. For each patient sampled, perceived access and clinical effectiveness data will be collected at four different time points: 1) pre‐implementation baseline, 2) 9 month follow‐up, 3) 20 month follow‐up, and 4) 31 month follow‐up. PTSD outcomes will be specified as a continuous change in the PCL‐5 score between baseline and follow‐up. Perceived access will be measured using items specifically developed for the project. Provider adoption will be assessed with qualitative interviews of all CBOC clinicians treating a sampled patient as well as members of the TOP intervention team (i.e., care manager, telepsychiatrists and telepsychologists) and the local champion. During the qualitative interviews with these CBOC and VAMC providers, the investigators will also assess barriers and facilitators to adoption, including their perceived benefits and weaknesses of the TOP intervention. Costs ‐ The investigators will measure the cost of both implementation strategies both prospectively and retrospectively. The investigators will collect data on implementation activities during both the standard VA and enhanced implementation strategies. These costs and activities will be assessed for the investigators' operational partners, local champions, and external facilitators, as well as personnel from the implementation sites at the VISN, VAMC, and CBOCs. The investigators will first examine the components of each implementation strategy and then identify activities for each component. These activities will include clinical workflow mapping, development of training materials, training sessions, meetings, and conference calls. The investigators will develop project logs to document these activities and time spent on each activity. The external facilitators, local champions and frontline providers on the implementation team will record the logs on a regular basis. The investigators will review meeting and conference call minutes to document time spent and attendance by the facilitation team, operational partners and clinical leaders and frontline providers. TOP intervention costs will be assessed from CDW (using provider IDs to identify TOP encounters). Data Analysis ‐ The stepped wedge SMART design allows us to estimate the effectiveness of the implementation strategy by comparing patient reach between groups of VAMCs randomized to standard or enhanced implementation and by comparing reach outcomes over time within the same VAMC as it is transitioned from standard implementation to enhanced implementation. Likewise, by collecting PCL‐5 scores pre‐baseline and again throughout each implementation step, the investigators will be able to compare access and PTSD outcomes of patients between VAMCs successfully implementing TOP to those not successfully implementing TOP and by comparing access and PTSD outcomes over time within the same VAMC as it is transitions from pre‐implementation to successful implementation. This will allow us to estimate the clinical effectiveness of the TOP promising practices as implemented in routine care. Following intent to treat principals, the investigators will estimate the clinical effectiveness of TOP for the entire sample regardless of whether they were reached to generate a measure of population level effectiveness. Generalized linear models will be used to account for the clustering of patients and providers within VAMCs and CBOCs. VAMCs and CBOCs will specified as random effects and time period will be specified as a fixed effect. The reach, access and PTSD outcome regressions will be estimated using patients as the unit of analysis and data from all VAMCs will be included regardless of whether the VAMC attained the performance measure benchmark. For hypothesis 1 (reach regression), the explanatory variable will be whether the VAMC was randomized to standard VA implementation or enhanced implementation during each step. For hypothesis 2 (PTSD outcomes regression) and 3 (access regression), the explanatory variable will be whether the VAMC attained the performance measure benchmark during each time period. Using implementation and intervention cost data, the investigators will also calculate the population level cost‐effectiveness of using the enhanced implementation strategy to deploy the TOP promising practice relative to the standard VA implementation strategy.

AB: Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of rehospitalization in older adults. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine whether telemonitoring by an advanced practice nurse reduced subsequent hospital readmissions, emergency department visits, costs, and risk of hospital readmission for patients with HF. One hundred two patient/caregiver dyads were randomized into 2 groups postdischarge; 84 dyads completed the study. Hospital readmissions, emergency department visits, costs, and days to readmission were abstracted from medical records. Participants were interviewed soon after discharge and 3 months later about effects of telemonitoring on depressive symptoms, quality of life, and caregiver mastery. There were no significant differences due to telemonitoring for any outcomes. Caregiver mastery, informal social support, and electronic home monitoring were not significant predictors for risk of hospital readmission. Further studies should address the interaction between the advanced practice nurse and follow‐up intervention with telemonitoring of patients with HF to better target those who are most likely to benefit.

AB: Obesity is one of the most important public health care problems worldwide and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and high healthcare costs. Not all obese patients have the same metabolic risk. It is pejorated in case of increase in the fat mass (FM) and especially when it predominates at the visceral abdominal level. Clinical trials have established the efficacy of lifestyle and behavioral interventions in obesity. The recent development of telerehabilitation is a promising approach that has only been the subject of pilot studies Therefore, we aim to test the effects of 3 months of telerehabilitation solution on fat mass evaluated by impedance analysis. The telerehabilitation program Telemouv includes physical activity sessions with low intensity endurance training targeted at the level of maximal oxidation, nutritional monitoring, therapeutic education tools and motivational support Patients with BMI > 30 kg/m² will be randomized for the intervention. We also will analyse the effects of the solution on different anthropometric, metabolic,cardiovascular and psychological parameters, and on rest and exercise metabolism. Moreover, we will assess behavioural changes in physical activity and nutrition At the end of the study, patients in the control group will be able to benefit from the telemouv solution in an ancillary study with a follow‐up of three months. For a alpha threshold of 5% and a study power of 90%, the study should include 22 patients in each group. Taking in account a possible 10% of dropout the study will need to include 25 patients by randomized arm to demonstrate an effect.

AB: Learning Objectives 1. To learn which patients benefit most 2. To learn about the set‐up for visceral arterial interventions 3. To learn specific tips and tricks The number and the complexity of percutaneous procedures involving visceral arteries is increasing from dilatations and stenting, grafting, embolizations and chemoembolizations, and coiling to chimneys and snorkels and fenestrated and branched stent grafts. Many patients who were previously considered to be ineligible have become eligible for endovascular treatment with the new tools and approaches. Consequently, there are many issues addressing the operators: • Access vessels, especially for larger devices, that are mainly affected by tortuosity and calcifications that influence catheterization and the rate of periprocedural complications • Catheter stability, allowing access and implantation of different devices • Radiation exposure to patients and operators, which is not negligible in this area, even in relatively simple interventional procedures • The amount of contrast media (CM) necessary for the procedures, etc. To overcome these issues, operators should be skilled during training, which lasts for years. In complex anatomy, the navigation and maneuverability of robotic catheter systems (RCS) are supposed to be better compared with those of manual catheterization and RCS should therefore be safer for patients because of the better stability of catheters and lower amount of radiation exposure and CM. Unfortunately, the current data, especially clinical, on the performance of RCS in the visceral arteries is limited and sometimes controversial, so it is difficult to draw solid conclusions. Especially, during the implantation of fenestrated and branched stent grafts, RCS are supposed to be able to reduce procedure time, radiation dose, and number of catheter movements in order to target the desired vessel and to potentially lower the complication rate, especially in combination with current image fusion and 3D imaging technology in the angiosuite. Catheter stabilization with RCS offers obvious advantage in difficult anatomies. Randomized study in animal models showed the superiority of RCS over manually performed procedure in the visceral, renal, and contralateral iliac arteries. The study included not only catheterization but also stent deployment in in vivo models. Vascular lesions after the procedures were significantly more common in manually performed procedures (p < 0.01). Overall, the study showed non‐inferiority to establish manual technique in tested animals, although the conclusions were drawn from healthy specimens and the results might be different in presence of pathology encountered in real‐life settings. Also, the time to target vessel cannulation showed superiority of RCS over manually performed procedure in the complex anatomies (branched and fenestrated stent grafts); cannulation of the renal, celiac, and superior mesenteric arteries was significantly faster with RCS. The greatest differences were in anatomically challenging vessel cannulation, with an overall time reduction of 83%. RCS offers centerline navigation, producing minimal impact to the vessel wall and reducing the possibility of vessel damage, distal embolization, or dissection. Catheter stability is another important feature, allowing the avoidance of deep ostial cannulation (with possible damage), while obtaining a stable route for endovascular therapy, including dilatation balloons and stent delivery at desired point without difficult curve crossing. There are some reports, including our experience, favoring access to the visceral arteries from above due to easier access to the target vessel and more stable catheter position. Stable ostial catheter position with RCS allows conventional, trans‐femoral approach instead of the approach from “above” that might be questionable, especially in the use of larger introducer sheaths necessary for some complex procedures. Technical results of RCS are often similar between highly experienced and less experienced interventional operators. This confirms that robotic therapy is easy to use, possibly reducing the learning time for beginners to perform complex procedures. Radiation doses, received during abdominal vascular procedures can be considerable, especially in long‐lasting, complex procedures. Radiation dose to the operator is reduced by the use of RCS, which allow remote control of the system. Consequently, the radiation dose for the staff is lower or even negligible in case of location of the remote control outside the angiosuite. Although dose reduction mostly affects staff, patient dose can also be reduced due to shorter procedure times. Aortic and iliac tortuosity, excessive calcifications, and plaques influence stent graft delivery and represent a high risk for vessel damage and distal embolization. Remote vascular access can be seriously affected by tortuosity, including visceral branches or contralateral limb cannulation, especially in the presence of a large, nonthrombosed abdominal aneurysm. Considerable iliac tortuosity makes manual target vessel cannulation increasingly demanding, while it was not affecting procedures, performed by RCS; functionality was unaffected by the severity of iliac tortuosity. Also, the robotic catheters are steered in contrast to the conventional catheters that require force and pushing, controlling the catheter tip and potentially resulting in a less traumatic impact to the vessel. In situ stent graft fenestration has been described in animal models, offering the possibility of endovascular approach to the patients unsuitable for conventional stent grafts, especially in emergency conditions where branched and fenestrated devices are not readily accessible. This technique could also be beneficial in aortic dissections, when fenestration between true and false lumens should sometimes be performed as well as for cannulation of arterial branches in false lumen. Promising data of in vitro and animal model‐based RCS are not always confirmed by clinical data; in a safety and feasibility study including 15 patients and 37 vessel cannulations, during branched and fenestrated stent graft implantations, not all vessels were cannulated by RCS in 15 minutes. Manual approach was successfully attempted in all patients, although cannulation time was longer than 30 minutes. Also, technical encounters were identified. Catheter steering in a limited space between aortic lumen and fabric was limited, and the diameter of peripheral catheter (6 Fr) was unsuitable for delivery of many peripheral stent grafts. There are other issues to consider, including less contact to the patient and less friendly environment due to additional RCS equipment, influencing patient comfort. It also offers no tactile and force feedback information, which is very important for the operators. Some systems try to overcome this with force sensors, allowing constant catheter‐tissue measurements, although still no tactile feeling can be simulated. Systems often use expensive and non‐standard catheters, raising costs and reducing catheter availability. The size of RCS is limited: for visceral use, 6 Fr is larger as catheters, used during manual catheterization, while for peripheral stent graft implantation, 6 Fr is often too small, while 9 Fr might cause issues with safe hemostasis. The major drawback of RCS is still the price. The systems are expensive; initial reported cost of more than 600,000$ is augmented with high maintenance costs of over 60,000$ per year, augmented with expensive disposable catheters. Though systems decrease gradually in size, they are still large and cumbersome, limiting the use in routine work in standard angiosuites. Set‐up times for the systems are not negligible, lasting from 5 to 15 minutes for each procedure in laboratory and clinical settings. Still, if the rest of the procedure would be performed faster, there would be minimal or no practical impact of RCS set‐up time on the procedure duration. Despite promising initial results, current clinical data show only limited benefit of RCS. Their use seems safe, and radiation dose, especially to the staff, can be significantly reduced. Further clinical studies will provide better insights and define the role of RCS in the visceral arteries. The major drawback for the wider use of RCS is the price of the system, its maintenance, and disposable catheters.

AB: BACKGROUND: Hospitals are standard of care for acute illness, but hospitals can be unsafe, uncomfortable, and expensive. Providing substitutive hospital‐level care in a patient's home potentially reduces cost while maintaining or improving quality, safety, and patient experience, although evidence from randomized controlled trials in the US is lacking. OBJECTIVE: Determine if home hospital care reduces cost while maintaining quality, safety, and patient experience. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Adults admitted via the emergency department with any infection or exacerbation of heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma. INTERVENTION: Home hospital care, including nurse and physician home visits, intravenous medications, continuous monitoring, video communication, and point‐of‐care testing. MAIN MEASURES: Primary outcome was direct cost of the acute care episode. Secondary outcomes included utilization, 30‐day cost, physical activity, and patient experience. KEY RESULTS: Nine patients were randomized to home, 11 to usual care. Median direct cost of the acute care episode for home patients was 52% (IQR, 28%; p=0.05) lower than for control patients. During the care episode, home patients had fewer laboratory orders (median per admission: 6 vs. 19; p<0.01) and less often received consultations (0% vs. 27%; p=0.04). Home patients were more physically active (median minutes, 209 vs. 78; p<0.01), with a trend toward more sleep. No adverse events occurred in home patients, one occurred in control patients. Median direct cost for the acute care plus 30‐day post‐discharge period for home patients was 67% (IQR, 77%; p<0.01) lower, with trends toward less use of home‐care services (22% vs. 55%; p=0.08) and fewer readmissions (11% vs. 36%; p=0.32). Patient experience was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of substitutive home‐hospitalization compared to in‐hospital usual care reduced cost and utilization and improved physical activity. No significant differences in quality, safety, and patient experience were noted, with more definitive results awaiting a larger trial. Trial Registration NCT02864420.

AB: Abstract: It is intuitive that post discharge surgical complications are associated with increased patient dissatisfaction, and directly associated with an increase in medical expenditures. It is also easy to make the connection that many post hospital discharge surgical complications including surgical site infections could be influenced or exacerbated by patient co‐morbidities. The authors of a recent study reported that female gender, obesity, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, and neurologic disease were all of among significant predictors of surgical site infections after vascular reconstruction was performed. The main concern for optimal patient care especially in geographically isolated areas of West Virginia is to have early, expeditious, and prompt diagnosis of early surgical site infection with subsequent indicated interventions. This theme will lead to patient satisfaction, minimizing third party interventions and decrease the total cost associated with these complications. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to believe that monitoring using telehealth technology and managing the general health care patients receive after a hospital vascular intervention will improve overall health and reduce post‐operative complications. Aims/Objectives: 1. The primary objective of the current project is to compare early and late outcomes for patients who receive post discharge health care monitoring (which includes using Telehealth electronic monitoring; THEM) to patients who receive standard of care (SOC) and routine discharge instructions and no monitoring. Methods: 1. Randomize patients who are scheduled to have revascularization interventions with groin incisions to receive either telehealth electronic health care monitoring or normal standard of follow‐up care. 2. Follow patients for 4 weeks, record any 30‐day hospital readmissions or complications. In addition, have participants complete the follow‐up survey questionnaires.

AB: Study Design: This study will utilize a cluster randomized clinical trial design (Phase III) in primary care settings. Eighteen practices will be randomized to 2 arms: A) provider‐level CSM theory‐based didactic and skills training to deliver oral health facts to parents, a prescription and a list of dentists accepting Medicaid + practice‐level EMR changes for documenting oral health; B) AAP based didactic training with no provision of resources or changes to the practice EMR. Arm A parents/caregivers will receive oral health facts and prescription to take their child to the dentist and improve oral health behaviors in the home, while Arm B parent/caregivers will receive usual AAP‐based care for oral health. Each arm will consist of 9 practices (n= 18), 33 to 34 providers (n= 67), and 512 parent/caregiver and child dyads (n= 1024). Each parent/caregiver and child dyads will be recruited at the first WCV and then followed for two consecutive WCVs (for a 24 month duration). Each provider will complete training prior to enrolling any parent/caregiver and will participate in the study for a total of 24 months duration. Immediately after randomization of practices, recruitment will be rolled‐out, i.e. parent/caregivers will be recruited during a 3‐month period in 6 practices at a time, with recruitment at all 18 practices expected to be completed in 9 months. The primary outcome is receipt of dental care assessed through data abstracted from Medicaid claims files, clinical dental screenings and parent/caregiver Dental Attendance Questionnaire responses. The secondary outcomes are development of new caries, changes in oral health behaviors and oral health quality of life, dental care costs, and implementation of the interventions. Participants: Subjects will be pediatric providers (Pediatricians/Nurse Practitioners) and parent/caregivers and their 3‐6 year old Medicaid‐enrolled children from 18 primary care practices located in 6 counties in NE Ohio. The study is offered to all pediatricians/nurse practitioners in the recruited practices and will be offered to all eligible caregivers and their children excluding those with serious medical or behavioral conditions which would preclude them from participating in the dental screening. All provider and parent participants meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study upon signing the consent form. Procedures: WCV #1 (Baseline): Before WCV #1, Providers (pediatrician/nurse practitioners) will receive oral health didactic education and skills training (based on study arm) to communicate core OH facts to parents/caregivers. They will complete pre‐ and post‐tests before and after the OH didactic education session. During the well‐child visit, caregivers will complete the following self‐administered Baseline questionnaires: Illness Perception Questionnaire‐Revised for Dental (IPQ‐RD) and Parent Questionnaire. A dental hygienist will perform the child dental screening examination and study staff will record results on the ICDAS Form. During the WCV, the provider will deliver oral health facts, give a prescription to take the child to the dentist + list of local Medicaid‐accepting dentists, and document oral health in EMR, based on study arm. Following the provider encounter, caregivers will provide feedback about the OH information given to them during the visit with a short self‐administered Exit Questionnaire. At the end of the WCV, caregivers will be given the Follow‐up IPQ‐RD to be completed and returned within 2 weeks (in postage paid envelope). At six months, caregivers will report whether the child visited the dentist and also complete an annotated cost questionnaire. WCV #2 (12 month follow‐up): Before WCV #2 Providers will receive an OH didactic education booster session. During and after the well child visit, providers and parent/child dyads will complete the same assessments and procedures done in WCV #1. WCV #3 (24 month follow‐up): There is no provider education booster session before WCV #3. During the well child visit, providers and parent/child dyads will complete the same assessments and procedures done in WCV #1 and #2, except the IPQ‐RD follow‐up questionnaire. The 6 month assessments will not be completed during the third well child visit. Analysis Plan: Primary Statistical Analysis: For the primary outcome, the investigators will use as an overall dental attendance score the number of years (over the 24 months of follow‐up) in which the child visited the dentist. This will be an ordinal outcome with possible scores of 0, 1 or 2. To assess the intervention effect, the investigators will use a generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach, with practices as clusters, based on a proportional odds marginal model. The model covariates will include an intervention indicator variable (equal to 1 for bundled intervention, 0 for enhanced usual care) and a set of baseline variables representing potential confounders. A standard error correction (for example, the method by Morel et al. 2003) will be used to adjust for a small number of clusters and 95% confidence intervals will be computed. This will be an intent‐to treat analysis as all randomized participants providing the necessary measurements ‐ regardless of any lack of compliance ‐ will be included in the analysis. In the event of missing data (for either year) for dental attendance, the investigators will conduct sensitivity analyses by imputing responses under conservative assumptions (favoring the null hypothesis) and re‐running the analysis described above on the completed data. Analysis of Secondary Outcomes: Summary statistics (including means and standard errors) for secondary outcomes will be calculated by intervention group. The same approach as above will be used for binary or ordinal secondary outcomes (oral hygiene, frequency of sweet snacks and beverages). Namely, ordinal outcomes for each variable will be defined that summarize outcomes over time. For continuous outcomes (e.g., OH quality of life, cost), the above method will be modified by using a linear model (identify link) for GEE, modeling the mean response over time as a summary measure. These outcomes will each be tested for normality using the Shapiro‐Wilk statistic; outcomes for which normality is violated will be transformed where appropriate or an alternative model used. For count outcomes (e.g., dft accumulated over time), the investigators will use a loglinear model (log link) assuming a negative binomial or other appropriate (e.g., zero‐inflated negative binomial) distribution. For proportion outcomes (e.g., dt/dft), the investigators will use GEE with a logit link, assuming the proportion follows a beta binomial or zero‐inflated beta binomial distribution. Similarly, the investigators will fit appropriate GEE models to test for the effect of each implementation strategy on the corresponding outcome (e.g., % prescriptions given as a measure of adoption). As in the dental attendance analysis, the intervention indicator as well as pertinent baseline variables will be included in the model. In addition, interaction terms (baseline variables by intervention) will be included to test for possible effect modification. For secondary analyses, a GLIMMIX model approach will be considered as an alternative, which may more easily allow for more than one cluster level if needed. Another alternative approach is to model the repeated measurements (again using GEE or GLIMMIX) which will add an additional cluster level ‐ namely, for individuals). Goodness of fit of alternative models will be compared using QIC for GEE (or AIC for GLIMMIX). Missing Data: In the likely event of missing responses, the investigators will first assess (In the context of repeated measures analyses) whether the data are missing completely at random (MCAR), that is, whether missingness of the given outcome is dependent only on participant baseline characteristics and not further on the observed outcome at an earlier time. This will be done by modeling missing data indicators for the repeated measurements of each outcome using a GEE (or GLIMMIX) approach with a logit link and including appropriate baseline (control) variables and the outcome at the previous time if available. The MCAR null hypothesis will be rejected if the previous outcome has a statistically significant effect on the probability of missing. A nonsignificant effect would support the use of GEE (which assumes MCAR). In addition to assessing the overall effects of the interventions, the investigators will investigate the mechanisms (or paths) through which interventions impact dental attendance. Data Management: The study staff will collaborate and interact with the NIH‐appointed Coordinating Center (CC) to perform data management and quality control activities. Study data will be collected and stored using the REDCap platform hosted by University of California‐San Francisco, the home institution of the CC. REDCap is a secure, web‐based application designed to support remote data capture for research studies. Study forms will be completed by participants on paper, and subsequently entered into REDCap by study staff, or on a tablet directly into REDCap. Paper forms will be securely stored in a locked file cabinet. Recorded audio will be deleted from the digital recording device immediately after being stored on a secure CWRU School of Dental Medicine network drive. Data for this study will include: (1) dental screening data, (2) study questionnaires, (3) abstracted medical data, (4) abstracted Medicaid dental claims data, (5) cost data (6) data from observation/audiotaping of providers, and (7) EMR audit data. Additionally, audio recordings will be used for fidelity monitoring. Form revisions should be minimal; however, should they occur, changes will be submitted to the CC for updating and dissemination to study staff. Quality control is primarily conducted at the study team level through internal processes of data review/data monitoring using periodic custom reports generated by the CC. The CC will assist with the design of project‐specific custom reports. The CC will run regular validation reports to detect data anomalies and will work with the local project staff to resolve any data anomalies that arise during data entry. REDCap's native data resolution workflow will be used to document and fix any data anomalies. The Data Manager will also respond to data queries generated by the PI, Study Coordinator, or other study staff. The CC will generate regular reports showing enrollment and potential data anomalies, which will be sent to PIs, Project Coordinators, and other relevant study staff.

Our aim was to explore the effects of telemedicine supported GDM care on a range of health service utilisation and maternal and foetal outcomes. METHODS: An exploratory randomised controlled trial of adjunct telemedicine support in the management of insulin‐treated GDM compared to usual care control. Outcomes included health service use, maternal and foetal clinical outcomes as well as costs. Groups were compared on outcomes and Poisson and Cox regression analysis were performed for predictors of health service utilisation, glycaemic control and costs. RESULTS: 95 participants were recruited (intervention n = 61, control n = 34). There were no differences between the groups in number of face‐to‐face appointments (median (IQR) intervention = 8(7), control = 8(6), p = 0.843), rates of caesareans, macrosomia, large for gestational age, special care nursery admission or newborn birth‐weight. The intervention had no impact on total (IRR = 1.04, p = 0.596) or face‐to‐face (IRR = 1.09, p = 0.257) clinic appointments or service provider costs. Participants receiving the intervention reached optimum glycaemic control quicker: mean (SD) 4.3(4.2) weeks vs. 7.6(4.5) weeks, p = 0.0001). Telemedicine was a significant predictor of better glycaemic control (HR = 1.71(95%CI: 1.11, 2.65, p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine support for GDM care showed no impact on service utilisation and costs. The intervention produced similar GDM clinical outcomes as usual care and posed no added risk to clinical quality of care. The intervention may be associated with fewer insulin dose titrations and participants achieved optimum glycaemic control sooner.

AB: The goals of rehabilitation are to improve functional level, decrease secondary morbidity and enhance health‐related quality of life. The costs associated with pressure ulcers are considerable. In addition to direct treatment‐ related costs, pressure ulcers also impact the hospital performance metrics. On top of the financial implications, pressure ulcers have a significant impact on patient morbidity and ‐mortality, as well as on health related quality of life. The researchers believe there is a large potential for improvement in prevention of pressure ulcers. An interdisciplinary approach, including home‐based rehabilitation programs, might help prevent PUs and their complications, and thus reduce associated costs. The investigators conducted a pilot in 2012, in which patients with SCI and PU were monitored through interdisciplinary outpatient homecare, using telemedicine. The project was beneficial for the users/ patients, especially in terms of user‐ participation and ‐contribution, the improved quality of life, and a better cooperation between primary and specialized healthcare services. Economic analysis indicated that telemedicine provides great savings for public healthcare services, and that using telemedicine with other patient groups with similar problems, could be beneficial. A positive outcome of this study can be made available to most PU patients. Knowledge about PU will contribute in both planning and establishment of good treatment lines for the patients, as well as contribute to environmental savings and a proper use of the health resources. This may reduce the consumption of hospital services, because a larger proportion of services are provided by the municipality. An important scientific significance of this research will thus be to improve, simplify and streamline health care and health‐ related services.

AB: Acute exacerbations are cardinal events in the natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Tele‐monitoring interventions are a relatively new field in COPD research and management. Furthermore, the effect of home tele‐rehabilitation on COPD exacerbation has not been thoroughly studied. Therefore, we set out to investigate whether a home tele‐rehabilitation program would be as beneficial as an outpatient maintenance rehabilitation program, in the context of COPD exacerbations, following completion of a 3‐month course of supervised pulmonary rehabilitation. We studied 137 Caucasian, ambulatory COPD patients. Forty seven patients were assigned to home maintenance tele‐rehabilitation (FEV1,%pred = 50 +/‐ 22, mean+/‐SD). Fifty patients were assigned to twice weekly hospital‐based maintenance rehabilitation (FEV1,%pred = 52 +/‐ 17). Forty COPD patients (FEV1, % pred = 52 +/‐ 21), were not assigned to any rehabilitation program and served as controls. Tele‐rehabilitation included home exercise reconditioning, self‐management techniques, dietary, and psychological advice. Patients were provided with tablets and wireless devices to record and transmit data, related to symptoms, lung function, and vital signs, to a tele‐health platform. Patients were followed up for 12 months. At baseline there were no significant differences amongst the tele‐rehabilitation (3.3 +/‐ 3.1), hospital‐based rehabilitation (3.4 +/‐ 1.9), or control (3.3 +/‐ 1.6), groups in terms of COPD exacerbations. After 12 months, COPD exacerbations in the group of home tele‐rehabilitation were significantly reduced to 1.7 +/‐ 1.7. In the group of hospital‐based rehabilitation COPD exacerbations were also significantly reduced to 1.8 +/‐ 1.4. In contrast, in the control group COPD exacerbations remained unchanged (3.5 +/‐ 1.7). There were significant difference amongst the two rehabilitation groups (tele‐rehabilitation and hospital‐based) and the control group in terms of COPD exacerbations (p < 0.001). In conclusion, ongoing home tele‐rehabilitation with the use of tele‐monitoring could significantly reduce COPD exacerbations and seems to be as beneficial as an outpatient hospitalbased maintenance rehabilitation program in the context of COPD exacerbations. Thus, tele‐rehabilitation may constitute a satisfactory alternative rehabilitative strategy to diminish health care costs.

AB: The study is designed to evaluate the impact of telemonitoring on the management of CHF compared with outpatient usual care. From a clinical point of view, the trial will allow to investigate how telemonitoring contributes to reduct the combined end point of all cause mortality and re‐hospitalizations, as well as the other kinds of access to hospital facilities (bed‐days, specialistic and ER visits). The trial will examine whether the CHF patients improve their health‐related quality of life and reduct the anxiety about health conditions, thanks to the telemonitoring. A cost‐effectiveness and cost‐utility analysis will be carried out in order to determine if and how telemonitoring helps to limit the healthcare expenditure. The evaluation will deal also with organizational changes and task shift due to telemonitoring introduction and patients and professional perception towards the service.

AB: Background: Early identification of exacerbations in COPD reduces hospital admission and may slow disease progression. There is increasing interest in telemedicine to support timely self‐management of exacerbations. The TELESCOT randomised control trial based in Lothian, Scotland, is investigating the impact of a tele‐monitoring service for COPD. Aims: To explore the views of patients and professionals participating in the trial about the impact of telemetry on hospital admissions. Method: We undertook semi structured interviews with patient and professional participants at different time points in the TELESCOT COPD trial. Transcribed, coded data was analysed thematically. Interpretation was supported by multidisciplinary discussion. Findings: 38 patients (47% male, mean age 67.5 years) and 32 professionals provided 70 interviews. Both patients and professionals considered that home tele‐monitoring reduced the risk of hospital admission. Patients used teledata to determine their state of health and to validate their decision to contact healthcare professionals earlier in order to prevent admission. Professionals emphasised the role of telemetry in encouraging compliance and facilitating patient self management as a means of reducing admissions, though they also expressed concern that telemonitoring may increase patient dependence on services. The impact on the cost of services was a concern. Conclusions: Enthusiasm for tele‐monitoring as a means of reducing admissions is tempered by concerns about increased demand on support services.

AB: Aim: It is still unclear whether telemonitoring reduces hospitalization and mortality in heart failure (HF) patients and whether adding an Information and Computing Technology‐guided‐disease‐management‐system (ICT‐guided‐DMS) improves clinical and patient reported outcomes or reduces healthcare costs. Methods: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was performed testing the effects of INnovative ICT‐guided‐DMS combined with Telemonitoring in OUtpatient clinics for Chronic HF patients (IN TOUCH) with in total 179 patients (mean age 69 years; 72% male; 77% in New York Heart Association Classification (NYHA) III‐IV; mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 28%). Patients were randomized to ICT‐guided‐DMS or to ICT‐guided‐DMS + telemonitoring with a follow‐up of nine months. The composite endpoint included mortality, HF‐readmission and change in health‐related quality of life (HR‐QoL). Results: In total 177 patients were eligible for analyses. The mean score of the primary composite endpoint was ‐0.63 in ICT‐guided‐DMS vs. ‐0.73 in ICT‐guided‐DMS + telemonitoring (mean difference 0.1, 95% CI: ‐0.67 +0.82, p = 0.39). All‐cause mortality in ICT‐guided‐DMS was 12% versus 15% in ICT‐guided‐DMS + telemonitoring (p = 0.27); HF‐readmission 28% vs. 27% p = 0.87; all‐cause readmission was 49% vs. 51% (p = 0.78). HR‐QoL improved in most patients and was equal in both groups. Incremental costs were €1360 in favor of ICT‐guided‐DMS. ICT‐guided‐DMS + telemonitoring had significantly fewer HF‐outpatient‐clinic visits (p < 0.01). Conclusion: ICT‐guided‐DMS + telemonitoring for the management of HF patients did not affect the primary and secondary endpoints. However, we did find a reduction in visits to the HF‐outpatient clinic in this group suggesting that telemonitoring might be safe to use in reorganizing HF‐care with relatively low costs.

AB: This methodological article provides a description of the design, methods, and rationale of the first prospective, noninferiority designed randomized clinical trial evaluating the clinical and cost implications of delivering an evidence‐based cognitive‐behavioral group intervention specifically treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with a trauma‐focused intervention via video teleconferencing (VTC). PTSD is a prevalent mental health problem found among returning Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) military populations. These returning military personnel often live in rural areas and therefore have limited access to care and specialized psychological treatments. In the field of mental health, telemental health (TMH) technology has introduced a potential solution to the persistent problem of access to care in remote areas. This study is enrolling approximately 126 returning veterans with current combat‐related PTSD who are receiving services through the Veteran Administration (VA) mental health care clinics on 4 Hawaiian Islands. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), an empirically supported manualized treatment for PTSD, is being delivered across 9 cohorts. Participants are assigned to either the experimental VTC condition or the in‐person control condition. Assessments measuring clinical, process, and cost outcomes are being conducted at baseline, mid‐treatment, post‐treatment, and 3 and 6 months post‐treatment. The study employs a noninferiority design to determine if the group treatment delivered via VTC is as good as the traditional in‐person modality. In addition, a cost analysis will be performed in order to compare the cost of the 2 modalities. Novel aspects of this trial and specific challenges are discussed.

KY: Weight Loss
AB: 1. Introduction With diseases such as Type 2 diabetes (T2D), adiposity and cardiovascular diseases rapidly increasing, cost effective management is needed (World Health Organization, 2017). Lifestyle improvements such as weight loss, diet and exercise managed in a primary care setting has shown significant impact on reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and reversing T2D for 46‐56% of patients with T2D (Lean et al., 2017, Johansen et al., 2017). Based on these findings, weight loss among overweight patients with T2D and patients at risk of developing T2D has important clinical and societal effects. Traditional lifestyle interventions are mostly ineffective and expensive long‐term. Internet and mobile technology‐based interventions aiming at promoting healthy lifestyles have shown potential for scalability, accessibility, and cost effective use in primary care settings both for overweight patients and T2D patients (Brandt et al, 2011, Haste et al., 2017, Komkova et al 2018). However, there is only sparse knowledge about whether the beneficial effects are long‐term (Afshin et al., 2016, Levine et al., 2015). Qualitative research studies comprising patients, general practitioners and the healthcare professionals' perspectives suggest that the establishment of an empathic relationship is key to long‐term lifestyle change (Brandt et al., 2018a, 2018b and 2018c). An observational study among 103 diabetes patients using the collaborative eHealth tool (LIVA) demonstrated a clinically significant self‐reported weight loss of 4.7 kg among users who had been on the platform for 90+ days (Komkova et al., 2018). Modelling the association between weight reduction and decreased health care costs, the same study estimated that the program will save 2,667€ annually for every patient and be cost effective from a municipal perspective even with only 1 year of implementation data for T2D patients (Mukherjee et al., 2016, Nichols et al., 2016, Bell et al., 2014). In the present study, the model to be tested is a lifestyle intervention using a cost‐effective eHealth coaching tool (LIVA) model: following an initial meeting, frequent digital communication is established between health coach and patient, supplemented by machine learning. Machine learning is performed using data automatically gathered from patients' relevant daily lifestyle registrations such as activity level, step count, diet goals fulfilment, sleep, etc. Data will be analysed to predict attrition and outcome. The developed algorithms and models will then be used to increase outcome and decrease dropout by supporting the health coaches with information and guidance how to deliver better coaching directly and indirectly. This intervention will be compared with standard lifestyle interventions in a municipality setting. 2. Study objectives and hypothesis The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the LIVA intervention for overweight patients at risk of developing a chronic disease and overweight type 2 diabetes patients in a primary care setting. We hypothesize that the LIVA intervention will lead to significant weight loss, reduced HbA1C, and reduced need for medication compared to usual care. 3. Methods and analysis Study design and setting The study is a randomized controlled trial with one year of intervention and one year of subsequent maintenance, with continued collection of clinical and questionnaire data, where the primary endpoint is weight loss and the secondary endpoint is HbA1c. The intervention is conducted in a real life setting; all data management will be at the Research Unit for General Practice, Department of Public Health, Primary trial sponsor, J.B. Winsløwsvej 9A, 5000 Odense C, Denmark. Recruitment of patients to the study is in 8‐10 municipalities within the Region of Southern Denmark and the Capitol Region of Denmark. The study has been registered at https://register.clinicaltrials.gov. On‐boarding of patients began in March 2018 and the results are expected to be accessible during 2021. Study population and inclusion criteria Flow of patients is described in figure 1. In each municipality, advertising through social media will be used to recruit eligible patients for municipal preventive offers, fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the study (Table 1). These patients will be contacted by phone and/ or email, and informed about the study and asked to register if they accept the offer to participate. Table 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria: BMI 45 ≥ 30 kg/m2 Aged 18 ‐70 years Exclusion criteria: Fails to provide informed consent Fails to complete the initial questionnaire or understand Danish No Internet access in own home through computer or smartphone Is pregnant or actively trying to get pregnant Experiences mental or serious life‐threatening disease The 340 eligible patients will be invited to an introduction meeting with an healthcare professional with a master's in human nutrition or a clinical dietician. This introductory appointment is scheduled within 7‐14 days after the information material is received by the patient. The patient is weighed and measured according to defined clinical indicators. Blood indicators are measured through a finger prick blood sample. The patient is then instructed to use a web link to complete a standard quality of life questionnaire (SF‐12) combined with registration of medication intake and questions concerning the patient's sociodemographic characteristics, such as educational level, labour market affiliation, questions concerning work performance, and disease history. Randomization: After patients have successfully completed the web questionnaire, they will be randomized via an automated computer algorithm. This procedure ensures that drop‐out characteristics can be recorded. Patients are randomized in a 60:40 sequencing, where 60% of recruited patients are randomized for the intervention group while the remaining 40% will constitute the control group, based on sample size calculations (Please see Sample size calculations, below). Randomization is controlled to ensure that 50% of intervention group and controls will be overweight patients at risk of developing chronic disease and the other 50% of intervention group and controls will be overweight diabetes patients. Intervention: The intervention is summarised in Table 2. Based on results in the applicant's PhD thesis, the core of the intervention is the initial establishment of an empathic relationship with a healthcare professional who is a clinical dietician by profession and has been working with eHealth lifestyle coaching for more than 2 years (referred to as the health coach) and who delivers effective remote and/or digital coaching responsive to the users' own data registrations (Brandt et al, 2018a). Patients in the intervention group receive a login to the eHealth tool at a personal meeting (either physical or digital) during which the health coach introduces the program. Together, the patient and the health coach agree on goals for diet, physical exercise, sleep, etc. (Brandt et al, 2018b). Using the app, patients fill in a daily record as well as their comments, concerns and questions for the health coach, who will have access to patient profiles. The health coach provides individual asynchronous advice according to the patients' needs based on the patients' own real‐time registrations (Brandt et al, 2018c); the health coach's advice is supported by artificial intelligence predictions using machine learning (Holzinger A. et al, 2017). The coach advises on goal setting based on the SMART model: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Timely, and according to a predefined guideline structure (Ryan et al, 2009). Asynchronous advice will be provided on a weekly basis during the first 6 months. Subsequently, advice will be given monthly for 6 months. After 12 months, the participant enters maintenance for 12 months, where the coach will still follow patients' registrations and may give four to twelve coaching sessions during that year. Patients can also participate in usual municipally provided preventive medicine offerings, such as "diabetes school", to the extent that the municipalities normally provide such offers. Conventional care (control group): Patients randomized to the control group will be offered standard municipal secondary or tertiary preventive offers. Study endpoints and assessment: Measurement of endpoints (weight, HbA1c etc.) will be conducted by the health coach at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months' follow‐up. Primary outcome: Weight loss from baseline to 12 months' follow‐up. Secondary outcome Reduction in HbA1c for all patients from baseline to 12 months for patients with T2D. Other outcomes The following tertiary outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 12 months: ‐ Retention rates among users ‐ Patient waist circumference ‐ Blood pressure ‐ Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and TG ‐ Patients' quality of life ‐ Changes in patterns of medication Apart from these outcomes, patient demographic characteristics (gender, age, highest educational level) will be measured at baseline. Analysis strategy Primary analyses will be performed blinded by statisticians and comprise subgroup analyses based on stratification according to patient characteristics and experiences. Statistical significance will be inferred at a two‐tailed and p<0.05 significance level. All data will be accessible on the Internet in anonymised form to allow full peer scrutiny and facilitate secondary research. Sample size calculations The primary objective of this study is measurement of changes in body weight and waist circumference. Weight loss in the intervention group and control group will be analysed using appropriate statistical procedures. Based on a recent study by Haste and colleagues evaluating a web‐based weight loss intervention among men with diabetes, we expect a weight loss of at least 4.5 kg at 12 months in the intervention group, compared to 2.5 kg in the control group, as well as dropout rates of 39% among the intervention group and 57% among control group at 12 months (Haste et al., 2017). A power calculation based on the standard deviations observed in the study performed by Haste et al shows that to detect a difference in weight loss of 2 kg with a power of 0.95% requires 55 patients in the intervention group and 32 in the control group. To be able to stratify analyses according to overweight patients at risk of developing chronic disease and overweight diabetes patients we will therefore recruit 200 (100+100) in the intervention groups and 140 (70+70) controls. 4. Ethics The intervention is not expected to cause any side effects or discomfort except for the ones a change in lifestyle can bring. The only recognized risk is in relation to eating disorders (pre‐existing or developing during the study) and the dieticians and nurses involved in the study will specifically look out for indications of this.

AB: Background: Hospitals are standard of care for acute illness, but hospitals can be unsafe, uncomfortable, and expensive. Providing substitutive hospital‐level care in a patient's home potentially reduces cost while maintaining or improving quality, safety, and patient experience, although evidence from randomized controlled trials in the US is lacking. Objective: Determine if home hospital care reduces cost while maintaining quality, safety, and patient experience. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Participants: Adults admitted via the emergency department with any infection or exacerbation of heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma. Intervention: Home hospital care, including nurse and physician home visits, intravenous medications, continuous monitoring, video communication, and point‐of‐care testing. Main Measures: Primary outcome was direct cost of the acute care episode. Secondary outcomes included utilization, 30‐day cost, physical activity, and patient experience. Key Results: Nine patients were randomized to home, 11 to usual care. Median direct cost of the acute care episode for home patients was 52% (IQR, 28%; p = 0.05) lower than for control patients. During the care episode, home patients had fewer laboratory orders (median per admission: 6 vs. 19; p < 0.01) and less often received consultations (0% vs. 27%; p = 0.04). Home patients were more physically active (median minutes, 209 vs. 78; p < 0.01), with a trend toward more sleep. No adverse events occurred in home patients, one occurred in control patients. Median direct cost for the acute care plus 30‐day post‐discharge period for home patients was 67% (IQR, 77%; p < 0.01) lower, with trends toward less use of home‐care services (22% vs. 55%; p = 0.08) and fewer readmissions (11% vs. 36%; p = 0.32). Patient experience was similar in both groups. Conclusions: The use of substitutive home‐hospitalization compared to in‐hospital usual care reduced cost and utilization and improved physical activity. No significant differences in quality, safety, and patient experience were noted, with more definitive results awaiting a larger trial. Trial Registration NCT02864420.

SO: Http://www.who.int/trialsearch/trial2.aspx? Trialid=actrn12618000520235
YR: 2018
AB: INTERVENTION: The overall duration of the trial is four years and it will be conducted in four Kimberley community clusters using a stepped‐wedge design. The stepped‐wedge design allows the scientific rigour of a randomized trial, whilst acknowledging the pragmatic need to gradually roll out an intervention over several communities in a remote region. The trial comprises of four phases: 1. Baseline 2. Intervention (implementation of the "SToP activities", where clusters are randomly "stepped" onto the SToP activities, following the stepped wedge design; two clusters randomised to the SToP activities known as "step 1" and two clusters randomised to the SToP activities one year later known as "step 2"). 3. Follow up. 4 Maintenance. Intervention: The "SToP Activities" There are three intervention components, collectively known as the “SToP activities”. As per the stepped‐wedge design, all community clusters will have transitioned ("stepped" onto) to the SToP activities upon completion of the trial. In Step 1, two randomly selected community clusters will receive the SToP activities. In Step 2, the remaining 2 community clusters will transition to receive the SToP activities. The SToP activities have three main components ‐ (a)"See"ing, (b)"Treat"ing, and (c) "Prevent"ing skin infections: a) “See”ing skin infections by providing health care worker training on the diagnosis and treatment of skin infections, and by conducting school‐based surveillance for skin infections. Health care worker training will be provided by trial staff and include face‐to‐face training sessions to up‐skill health care workers with the latest evidence based recommendations for identifying and treating skin infections. Health care workers will be invited to attend this training session prior to each school based surveillance/screening visit (described below). The training session duration will range from 1‐2hours up to a full day (depending on availability of health care workers). Health care workers will also be provided with online and paper resources of this training information, such as a training flipchart, self‐assessment quiz for feedback on their learning, and training videos. Where possible, trial staff will provide further 'hands on' training and demonstrate identifying skin infections by partnering with health care worker staff to complete the school‐based surveillance/screening. The school‐based surveillance/screening (and early childhood where feasible) will involve trial staff (and where possible, health care worker staff) screening children at school to assess their skin for infections. If skin infections are identified, the child will be referred to the local clinic for treatment. Their parent/caregiver will also be notified and recommended to take them to the clinic for treatment. School surveillance/screening visits will occur in all 4 communities three times per year for 3 years (total of 9 visits). b) “Treat”ing skin infections according to the latest evidence and utilising ‘Structured Administration and Supply Arrangements’ (previously known as “standing orders”) for streamlined treatment, namely co‐trimoxazole twice daily for 3 days for impetigo, ivermectin on days 0 and 8 for scabies cases and their contacts and holistic care including treatment of those identified with crusted scabies (ivermectin on days 0, 1 and 8 for grade 1 crusted scabies). Treatment will occur at the local community clinic and occur as individuals present to the clinic and are assessed as requiring this treatment. Mode, dose and duration for cotrimoxazole (for treatment of impetigo): 4mg/kg/dose twice daily for 3 days according to weight band based dosing of the trimethoprim component of trimethoprim/ sulphamethoxazole. Either syrup or tablets will be recommended depending on age and preference. Adherence to the treatment will not be monitored. The investigational medicinal product (IMP) for this trial is ivermectin (for treatment of scabies/crusted scabies). This trial will use ivermectin off label as first line treatment for cases of scabies, preventative treatment of asymptomatic household contacts of the diagnosed cases, and be administered to patients more than 15kg but irrespective of age. Mode, dose and duration for ivermectin: 200 µg/kg (weight band dosing) single dose oral tablet (once daily), taken on day 0 and day 8. Ivermectin dosing will predominantly occur at the clinic as it will be a single dose on day 0 (and day 8) if indicated. Adherence to the treatment will not be monitored but adverse events will be recorded. Patients presenting with both scabies and impetigo will be treated for both conditions simultaneously as described above. c) “Prevent”ing skin infections through embedded, culturally informed and developed health promotion and environmental health activities. These activities will occur throughout the trial at a community level and as determined by local health promotion and environment CONDITION: crusted scabies impetigo scabies PRIMARY OUTCOME: Diagnosis of impetigo at school screening in children aged 5 and less than 10 years of age. ; ; As assessed by physical skin examination at school screening surveillance visits. SECONDARY OUTCOME: All‐cause clinic presentations and hospitalisations from the communities, (including those for non‐skin eg anaemia, skin related eg sepsis, and skin causes) in children aged <10 years. ; ; Assessed by clinic medical records. Awareness of skin health in interviews among community members and health staff. ; ; Assessed as per study interview guide. Determine the cost of diagnosing and managing skin infections, and the cost of the routine SToP activities. ; ; Data will be collected retrospectively from study records and documentation pertaining to the costs that were expended to complete skin infection diagnosis, skin infection management, and implementation of the SToP activities. Diagnosis of scabies in children aged between 5 and less than 10 years. ; ; As assessed by physical skin examination at school screening surveillance visits. Monitoring age at first scabies and impetigo diagnosis in the 12‐month birth cohort after the SToP activities have been adopted. ; ; Assessed by clinic medical records. Monitoring of antimicrobial prescribing for skin infections and other conditions. ; ; Collected monthly via data extractions from clinic medical records. The monthly data extractions will report on medications administered/supplied, and according to what condition (including skin infections or other). Monitoring of cotrimoxazole resistance in circulating S. aureus and GAS strains. ; ; To understand the circulating clones of S. aureus and GAS and resistance phenotype/ genotype, each child with a crusted or purulent skin sore diagnosed during school screening will have a bacterial culture swab collected using previously published methods for transportation and susceptibility testing. In addition, each child participating in the early childhood and school surveillance programs will have a throat swab collected at baseline and end of step 2 for detection of S. aureus and S. pyogenes. ; ; Each swab will be processed for detection of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes on HBA, HBA+CNA and MRSA Chromagar. Routine susceptibility testing will be performed for S. aureus and S. pyogenes. In addition, an E test (Biomerieux) for GAS and S. aureus susceptibility to trimethoprim and cotrimoxazole will also be performed on MHA or MHF as per EUCAST methods. ; ; Cultures will be examined for morphologic growth of beta‐haemolytic streptococci (BHS; off white colonies) and S. aureus (white or yellow, ß‐haemolytic). Colonies of BHS will be subcultured onto HBA plates for subsequent identification using a Streptococcal Grouping Kit (Cat# DR0585, Oxoid). Isolates of group A, C and G will be identified and stored frozen in STGGB. A scraping of the stored frozen culture will be used to subculture the isolate for antibiotic susceptibility testing. Both a disc diffusion (penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin) and E test (trimethoprim and trimethoprim‐sulphamethoxazole) will be used to determine susceptibility of BHS to these antibiotics. Colonies resembling staphylococci will be subcultured and identified using a rapid latex agglutination test (Staphytect Plus; Cat# DR0850, Oxoid). S. aureus isolates will be stored frozen in STGGB. A scraping of the stored frozen culture will be used to subculture the isolate for antibiotic susceptibility testing. ; ; Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) will be performed on skin and throat isolates collected at baseline and end of step 2 to assess for genotypic resistance, clonality and virulence factors. ; ; We will also monitor routinely collected microbiology data e.g. antibiograms from appropriate surrogate markers to observe the ecological impact of increased use of cotrimoxazole. ; Overall acceptability of the program measured at baseline and follow up. ; ; Assessed as per study interview guide. Overall clinic presentations due to skin conditions including abscess in all age‐deciles. ; ; Assessed by clinic medical records. The diagnosis of impetigo at early childhood centres and the clinic in children aged 0 – 4 years. ; ; As assessed by physical skin examination at school screening surveillance visits; which will also include early childhood centre screening where feasible. The diagnosis of scabies at early childhood centres and the clinic in children aged 0 – 4 years. ; ; As assessed by physical skin examination at school screening surveillance visits; which will also include early childhood centre screening where feasible.

YR: 2014
AB: INTERVENTION: Telemedicine (Intervention) Telemedicine will be an add‐on (adjunct) to usual care and TeleGDM will refer to Telemedicine plus usual care. The duration of the intervention will be from enrollment until delivery of the baby. Women recruited to this arm will continue monitoring their BGL, insulin dosing and symptoms according to diabetes education and counseling advice. The difference to usual care alone is that the women in the TeleGDM arm will upload their BGL via a USB cable connection of the glucometer to the computer, and manually enter insulin, dietary/meal information and symptoms data to an online personal health record (PHR). Four BGL readings a day (one preprandial, and three postprandial (breakfast, lunch, dinner) readings) are expected as per usual care. The PHR is set up with every second day automatic reminder to upload data. In addition a Credentialed Diabetes Educator Registered Nurse (CDE‐RN) can message the patients if data are not uploaded as expected. When new data are upload an alert email is automatically sent to the CDE‐RN, who in turn reviews the data, coordinates care with the other GDM clinic team members and provides feedback and/or care advice to the patients via the PHR (email) messaging and SMS system. This approach reduces the need for clinicians to wait for patients to bring data on paper diary to their scheduled appointment at a later time, usually 1‐2weeks. That is, the TeleGDM approach will provide the ability for a timely response and action in order to deliver individually tailored GDM management in response to the patient’s needs. It is expected clinicians will still schedule face‐to‐face appointment as usual and recall patients as they normally would based on their clinical decision making. CONDITION: Gestational Diabetes Mellitus PRIMARY OUTCOME: Patient service utilisation: Assessed as a composite of scheduled face‐to‐face consultations, unscheduled face‐to‐face consultations, and telephone consultations ; ; GDM consultation encounters data will be collated from hospital medical records. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Clinician satisfaction using the Canada Health Infoway System And Use Assessment Survey questionnaire. Diabetes self efficacy using the Diabetes self Empowerment Scale Short Form (DES‐SF) questionnaire. Glycaemic control. This will be assessed using BGL data. For women in the intervention group BGL data will be obtained from readings they upload to personal health record (Telemedicine system). BGL data for women in the usual care arm will be obtained from their paper based diary. Insulin adjustments assessed as the frequency of insulin adjustments and the number of days between adjustments and information will be collated form medical records. Large for gestational age (LGA) assessed as weight greater than 90th percentile. Weight will be obtained from medical records. Macrosomia assessed using foetal ultrasound Number of neonate admissions to special care nursery. Information will be obtained from hospital medical records. Patient satisfaction assessed using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ‐8). Service provision costs. This will be estimated from billable service provision per care episode and will be obtained from hospital administrative data and subscription to use the online personal health record. Technology capability and capacity assessed a composite of measures of volume of system usage: login encounters, frequency of data uploads, volume of messages between patients and clinicians over the system, volume of technical glitches or queries. ; ; The data will be collated from the online personal health record logs. ; Type of delivery (normal vaginal delivery, caesarean delivery or instrument deliveries). Data will be collated form medical records. INCLUSION CRITERIA: IADPSG criteria based clinical diagnosis of GDM confirmed by OGTT 24‐33 weeks of gestation or earlier diagnosis if in high risk group Management of hyperglycaemia with insulin and no more than 35 weeks gestation.

AB: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory rheumatism in adults, affecting nearly 0.4% of the general population. It is a real public health issue. International guidelines recommend strict control (remission or low disease activity) of the disease, to avoid joint destruction in order to reduce the functional impact of the disease in the long term and to improve the quality of life of the patients. This care is based on a close follow‐up requiring regular visits with the specialist which represents an additional cost (transport, visits). In this context, tele‐medicine is often proposed as a complementary approach in the management of these chronic patients. Thus, the investigators propose to study the interest of a connected device by comparing a group of patients using this Smartphone application, coupled with a hand dynamometer during the 6 months following initiation of a new DMARD.

AB: We studied the effects of home telemonitoring in elderly patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) on mortality and rate of hospitalization, compliance with treatment, quality of life and costs of CHF management, by comparison with a group receiving usual care. Fifty‐seven elderly CHF patients were randomized to standard care or to home telemonitoring‐based care and followed for 12 months. In the subjects who were monitored, weekly reports on their clinical status were obtained and their management was modified accordingly. Home telemonitoring was associated with improvements in the composite endpoint of mortality and rate of hospitalizations (P = 0.006), a better compliance with therapy, more frequent use of beta‐blockers and statins, lower total cholesterol level and a better reported health perception score. The improved results with home telemonitoring in CHF were probably due to better compliance and to closer monitoring of the patients.

AB: HYPOTHESIS / AIMS OF STUDY: eHealth is emerging and potentially has advantages for the treatment of UI in women. Especially, the use of mobile health applications (apps) may increase adherence to treatment advices and therewith reduce costs for UI management (1). Although various apps aimed at supporting the treatment of UI are currently available, little is known about the expectations and preferences of users of these apps and whether their expectations correspond with their actual experiences. This lack of knowledge may result in poor implementation of a possibly effective application. The aim of this study is to explore experiences and preferences regarding usability of an app‐based treatment for UI in women. STUDY DESIGN, MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a qualitative usability study as part of an extensive process evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating an app‐based treatment for stress, urgency and mixed UI in women. We invited women applying the following inclusion criteria: age > 18 years, suffering from self‐reported stress, urgency or mixed UI at least twice a week according to the 3 Incontinence Questions (3IQ), a wish for treatment and access to a smartphone or tablet. Exclusion criteria were: indwelling urinary catheter, urogenital malignancy, previous surgery for UI, treatment for UI in the previous year (pharmacologically or non‐pharmacologically), terminal or serious illness, cognitive impairment or psychiatric disorders, urinary tract infection, overflow or continuous UI, pregnancy or recent childbirth (< 6 months ago) or the inability to complete a questionnaire in Dutch. We recruited women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, but who did not participate in the RCT to avoid the chance of influencing the RCT. For this, we invited women who had contacted their GP for UI in the past 10 years through an information letter. After checking for in‐ and exclusion criteria by the researcher and written informed consent, participants filled in a short questionnaire on patient characteristics, UI severity, comorbidity, drug use and previous experience with the internet. Participants used the App during 6 weeks, after which semi‐structured interviews were held to explore preferences and experiences regarding the usability of the App. Questions included in the interview guide were based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). TAM is a validated instrument to use in a healthcare setting and is good at predicting the use of eHealth. Additionally, questions on experiences with specific app functions were asked. Automatically logged data on app‐usage were collected and used to further guide the interviews. Interviews were conducted at the patients GP practice and recorded using a digital voice recorder after which they were transcribed verbatim. Transcriptions were coded in duplicate by two researchers, using nVivo and checked for consensus. Recruitment of participants continued until saturation was reached (i.e. no new themes emerged during the interviews). Data analysis was driven by an inductive approach, which allowed themes to emerge from the data by constant comparison. RESULTS: Nine women, age 32 to 68 years, participated (saturation was reached after 9 interviews). The duration of UI complaints ranged from 1.5 to 26 years. Participants had urgency UI (3), stress UI (1), mixed UI (2), urgency‐predominant mixed UI (2), and stress‐predominant mixed UI (1). Four women indicated that they used incontinence pads on a daily basis. The ICIQ‐SF score ranged from 2 to 13, indicating a low to moderate self‐perceived severity of UI. Data analysis generated the following four main themes: Accessibility: this covers ease of use and how this relates to privacy. Most participants experienced the app as convenient; it made UI care and treatment easily accessible. Some participants stated that the app made it easier to receive treatment while keeping their UI symptoms private. These participants mentioned that they disliked discussing their symptoms with others and that fear of internal examination kept them from seeking help. In contrast, some participants also mentioned that they found it easier to talk about their symptoms after they started using app. Awareness: participants mentioned that the use of the app enhanced their awareness of their symptoms. Some participants realized that their symptoms were worse than they had previously thought. For some this was an unpleasant and confronting experience. Several participants also expressed that they became more aware of the treatment possibilities for UI and that the app made them more aware of their coping strategies and ways how these could be improved. Usefulness: this covers the perceived usefulness of the app, describing ways in which the app is serving a purpose for the user. Seven participants stated that overall they were positive about the usefulness of the app and would recommend the app to other women with(UI) Furthermore, the majority of the participants stated that they would probably use the app in the future. Adherence: this covers the time it takes to be engaged with the app, to adhere to the treatment and factors that promote adherence. The majority of participants mentioned that they found it difficult to do the exercises on a regular basis, because they felt they were too busy with work or private life to invest time in the app treatment. In contrast, one participant mentioned that the app is especially suitable for people with busy schedules. Participants stated that the reminder function of the app promoted adherence to the treatment. Also, some women noted that symptom improvement was motivated them to continue doing the exercises. Another participant stated that the display of her progress in the graphs was motivational. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS: The results of this study provide insight into whether an app based treatment for UI fits the needs of its users. In general, women appreciated the increased accessibility of UI healthcare and possibility of 24/7 support. It enabled them to do the exercises at their own time and pace. These findings are in line with a previous study, which reported that a smart‐phone‐based therapy for depression felt more accessible and present in patients' everyday lives. In our study, some women were specifically attracted by the sense of privacy with the app‐based treatment. Women were able to receive healthcare and treat their symptoms without having to consult a healthcare provider. On the other hand, some women experienced usage of the app had lowered barriers to talk about their UI complaints. Similar findings were reported in a study evaluating a treatment program for SUI without face‐to‐face contact, which described it breaking down some of the shame barriers. An important challenge in long‐term adherence to UI treatment is fitting the exercises into patients' daily lives. Women in this study stated that they regularly forgot to do the exercises and mentioned that the reminder function of the app was an important feature; it supported them in reminding to do the exercises. This is in line with existing literature, which confirms the importance of reminder functions in eHealth tools. Other motivators to continued use of the app were symptom improvement and progress in exercise program. The greatest barrier to adherence mentioned by participants was being too busy. And even though women appreciated the fact that UI health care was accessible without health care provider consultation, several participants also mentioned the possible additional value of health care support. This is in line with studies on eHealth which show that adherence was low in the absence of face‐to‐face contact with a healthcare provider, possibly due to the lack reduced feelings of obligation (2). The results of this study indicate similar issues. CONCLUDING MESSAGE: This is the first study exploring experiences and preferences of women regarding an app‐based treatment for all three types of urinary incontinence(UI), i.e. stress, urgency and mixed, with the use of in‐person interviews Research has shown that patients may experience many barriers in the use self‐care applications resulting in poor implementation of the application. Therefore, it is strongly advised to take into account the experiences and expectations of important stakeholders, like patients (3). In this study barriers and facilitators were explored, providing insight not only for treatment effects of a mobile application in the treatment of UI but potentially also for other future eHealth applications. By combining these results with experiences and expectation of other stakeholders like healthcare providers and with data on the (cost) effective‐ness from the RCT ('mixed methods') we will be able to provide a complete picture of the introduction of an e‐Health app for treatment of UI in women.

AB: Modern technology like computers, smartphones and the internet enable patients to measure certain health indicators like blood pressure and body weight from the comfort of their own homes. This information can also be shared electronically with doctors and other healthcare providers. This is called home health monitoring. In TEC4Home, the investigators are developing a home monitoring solution for patients with heart failure to support their care and recovery after a visit to the emergency department. The investigators hypothesis is that TEC4Home will be a cost‐effective strategy to decrease 90‐day Emergency Department (ED) revisits and hospital admission rates, and improve self‐management and quality of life for patients with Heart Failure (HF).

Methods A cluster‐randomised trial was conducted for six months at the 20 rural health clinics selected from three districts in Mongolia. With a computer‐generated sequence, health clinics were randomly allocated either to the intervention group, in which all general practitioners (GPs) received TD consultation through Sana system, or the control group, in which GPs referred patients to the dermatologist at district hospital whenever needed. The primary outcome was to estimate the distance traveled, times spend and the cost of travel required in receiving dermal care for patients in rural Mongolia. Analysis was done to estimate the difference between the aforementioned parameters among intervention and control groups.

AB: Objective: Our goal is to create a tele‐colposcopy platform for medically un‐derserved regions both locally and globally. We previously reported on a portable pocket colposcope that allows for low‐cost, high quality VIAM of cervical cancer precursors. We now focus on comparing acetowhitening, vascular features, and iodine uptake imaged with the pocket colposcope to determine what combination provides the highest accuracy for static image evaluation, by experts via SMS. Methods: Images have been obtained from more than 500 patients in the U.S., Peru, and Sub‐Saharan Africa using pairs of contrast mediators. Expert colpo‐scopists provided a semi‐quantitative evaluation in a blinded, randomized manner, classifying each image as normal, low grade dysplasia, high grade dysplasia, and suspicious for cancer. Results were compared to pathology when available. Results: Blinded images read by three or more expert colposcopists showed high concordance (80‐90%) between the pocket colposcope and a high‐end colposcope for detection of VIAM positive results. When comparing specifically to pathology, images captured with the pocket colposcope and a high‐end colposcope agreed 69% for acetic acid images, 72% for acetic acid and green light images, and 83% for acetic acid and Lugol's iodine images. Conclusions: This preliminary analysis suggests that the level of agreement between devices as well as pathology increased when expert colposcopists had access to additional sources of contrast. We recently collected 150 images using a combination of acetic acid, Lugol's iodine and vascular imaging and analysis is underway. Our expectation is that using all three sources of contrast will be superior to paired contrast mediators.

KY: Disease Progression; Parkinson Disease
AB: Telemedicine and smartphone‐based remote sensor assessments represent particularly promising opportunities to streamline study conduct, reduce participant burden, and allow for the collection of data beyond the usual episodic, in‐clinic assessments. Demonstrating the utility of these relatively inexpensive accessible platforms for the measurement of PD progression would also establish the infrastructure for long‐term follow up of participants after completion of interventional studies. STEADY‐PD3 (a.k.a. STEADY‐PD III) and SURE‐PD3 were both designed as phase 3 trials of potential disease‐modifying interventions in PD. In both studies, de novo PD participants were randomized in 1:1 allocation to active therapy versus placebo with longitudinal follow up for three and two years, respectively. Both studies include collection of DNA and plasma samples, which along with rigorously collected clinical data will become part of the Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP), providing valuable resources for biomarker development. Long‐term observation of participants from these two trials, together comprising ~600 early PD subjects, is invaluable not only in characterizing any persistent or delayed benefits of either randomized treatment but also in the development of tele‐health outcomes to facilitate future interventional trials in PD and of neurotherapeutics more broadly. Challenges of traditional long‐term follow up of large cohorts are the high cost of in‐clinic assessment, the high dropout rates and the need to maintain multi‐site infrastructure. The objective of this study is to leverage modern technology to develop, pilot and implement a 100% virtual model for long‐term follow up utilizing telemedicine and smartphone platforms for quantitative monitoring of clinician‐ and patient‐reported outcomes (PROs). This cohort may also serve to test feasibility of new technology platforms as they become available.

AB: Telehealth is a means of providing care from a distance, at the convenience of the patient. This study will be testing the addition of Telehealth visits (TH) to the standard of care (SOC) following discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This study will be used to determine whether Telehealth appointments post‐NICU discharge can improve the experiences of parents in caring for their infant and reduce the number of health care visits they have with their infant within three months post‐NICU discharge. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to two groups. One group will receive the standard of care, which means they will have an appointment in place with a primary care provider, pediatrician or return visit to the NICU post discharge. The second group will have the standard of care described above and two Telehealth visits within the first week at home with their infant. The study will explore the experiences of parents of NICU infants following their discharge from NICU, both those receiving standard of care (SOC) and the Telehealth monitoring intervention. Participants will be required to complete surveys online at 5 time periods: when parents decide to be part of the study, prior to discharge from NICU, 1 day after discharge, 2 days following the primary care provider visit and at 3 months following discharge from NICU. The questionnaires used will measure parental anxiety levels and parental confidence. The number of infant visits to the primary care provider, pediatrician, emergency department and NICU will also be collected at three months post‐NICU discharge. A subset of participants (from both SOC and TH groups) will further participate in semi‐structured interviews about their experiences in the NICU and caring for their children after discharge. NICU clinicians who consent will participate in semi‐structured interviews about their experiences with the Telehealth intervention. The cost‐effectiveness of the Telehealth intervention will be analysed in comparison to SOC.

AB: Background: Early identification and mitigation of cancer therapy‐induced complications can improve quality of life and reduce complications and health care costs. We are evaluating the efficacy of a system, called CYCORE (CYberinfrastructure for Comparative effectiveness Research), to systematically and accurately collect daily weight, blood pressure, pulse and symptom data from head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors during their 6 to 7‐week radiation treatment (RT) regimen using home‐based biometric and other sensors integrated with a cyber‐physical system. Aims include: 1) evaluate CYCORE's efficacy in reducing hospitalization and emergency room visits related to dehydration; and, 2) evaluate related impact on costs related to treating dehydration. Methods: Remote, sensor‐based monitoring via CYCORE identifies HNC survivors at increased risk for dehydration (i.e., reduced blood pressure and weight, increased pulse, and patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) including decreased food and fluid intake). Upon initation of RT, HNC survivors are randomized to either: 1) standard care plus use of the CYCORE system, wherein biometric sensor data and PROs (e.g., pain, nausea, medications, food/fluid intake) are collected ; or, 2) standard care. Outcomes include hospital and emergency room admissions, and related costs. Results: To date, 113 survivors are enrolled (88.9% recruitment and 90.3% retention rates). Those randomized to CYCORE take daily home readings of weight, blood pressure and pulse via Bluetooth‐enabled devices, and complete daily PRO assessments on a mobile application. Survivors' data are available for viewing and clinical decision‐making via a Web‐based interface by their physicians and other providers. Previously, 59% of HNC survivors on RT showed physiologic signs of dehydration while using the CYCORE system. Worse ratings of nausea and vomiting predicted dehydration risk. Conclusions: CYCORE may serve as one model for integrating mobile and sensor technologies during critical periods of cancer care that occur outside of the clinic setting, and may improve management of treatment side effects, quality of life, and greater satisfaction with care.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a specialist telemedicine intervention for improving diabetes care using the chronic care model (CCM). PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: As part of the CCM, 97 primary care physicians at 6 primary care practices in Rochester, MN, referred 639 patients to an on‐site diabetes educator between July 1, 2001, and December 31, 2003. On first referral, physicians were centrally randomized to receive a telemedicine intervention (specialty advice and evidence‐based messages regarding medication management for cardiovascular risk) or no intervention, keeping outcome assessors and data analysts blinded to group assignment. After each subsequent clinical encounter, endocrinologists reviewed an abstract from the patient's electronic medical record and provided management recommendations and supporting evidence to intervention physicians via e‐mail. Control physicians received e‐mail with periodic generic information about cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetes. Outcome measures included diabetes care processes (diabetes test completion), outcomes (metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, estimated coronary artery disease risk), and patient costs (payer perspective). RESULTS: During the intervention, 951 (70%) of the 1361 endocrinology reviews detected performance gaps and resulted in a message; primary care physicians reported using 49% of messages in patient care. With a mean of 21 months' follow‐up, the intervention, compared with control, did not significantly enhance metabolic outcomes or reduce estimated risk of coronary artery disease (adjusted mean difference, ‐1%; 95% confidence interval, ‐19% to 17%). The intervention group incurred lower costs (P=.02) but not in diabetes‐related costs. CONCLUSION: Specialty telemedicine did not significantly enhance the value of CCM in primary care.

AB: Background: Consultation of a nephrologist is important in aligning care for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at the primary‐secondary care interface. However, current consultation methods come with practical difficulties that can lead to postponed consultation or patient referral instead. Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether a web‐based consultation platform, telenephrology, led to a lower referral rate of indicated patients. Furthermore, we assessed consultation rate, quality of care, costs and general practitioner (GPs') experiences with telenephrology. Methods: Cluster randomized controlled trial with 47 general practices in the Netherlands was randomized to access to telenephrology or to enhanced usual care. A total of 3004 CKD patients aged 18 years or older who were under primary care were included (intervention group n = 1277, control group n = 1727) and 2693 completed the trial. All practices participated in a CKD management course and were given an overview of their CKD patients. Results: The referral rates amounted to 2.3% (n = 29) in the intervention group and 3.0% (n = 52) in the control group, which was a non‐significant difference, OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.31 to 1.23. The intervention group's consultation rate was 6.3% (n = 81) against 5.0% (n = 87) (OR 2.00; 95% CI 0.75‐5.33). We found no difference in quality of care or costs. The majority of GPs had a positive opinion about telenephrology. Conclusion: The data in our study do not allow for conclusions on the effect of telenephrology on the rate of patient referrals and provider‐to‐provider consultations, compared to conventional methods. It was positively evaluated by GPs and was non‐inferior in terms of quality of care and costs.

AB: Background: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a common, serious, and costly disease whose clinical course is often characterized by recurrent hospitalizations due to fluid overload and/or worsening of renal function. Frequent (i.e. almost real‐time) adjustments of treatment are needed to lower morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Purpose: To assess whether follow‐up of CHF patients using telemonitoring (TM) vs. usual care (UC) impacts patient and economic outcome. Methods: One hundred and sixty CHF patients (mean age 76+/‐10 years, 104 males, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 35+/‐15%) were block randomized by sealed envelopes and assigned to 6 months of intense follow‐up facilitated by TM or UC. The TM group measured body weight, blood pressure, and heart rate on a daily basis with electronic devices that transferred the data automatically to an online database. Email alerts were sent to the patients' general practitioner as well as to the heart failure centre to proactively intervene when pre‐defined limits were exceeded. Individual healthcare costs were obtained from the Belgian healthcare expenditures database. Results: All‐cause mortality was significantly lower in the TM group than in the UC group (5% vs. 17.5%, P=0.01). The total number of follow‐up days lost to hospitalization, dialysis, or death was significantly lower in the TM group as compared with the UC group (13 vs. 30 days, P=0.02). The number of hospitalizations for heart failure per patient showed a non‐significant trend in favor of TM (0.24 vs. 0.42 hospitalizations/patient, P=0.06). Although the total drug and healthcare expenditures per patient/month were higher in the UC group than in the TM group (678.28+/‐1,246.02 vs. 477.72+/‐1,239.04 and 5,392.76+/‐8,084.40 vs. 4,327.30+/‐10,021.00), the differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Although the use of TM in a cohort of patients with severe chronic heart failure positively impacts clinical outcome, it does not reduce healthcare costs. A large randomized trial is, however, needed to confirm these findings.

AB: BACKGROUND: Hospitals are the standard of care for management of acute illness, but hospital care can be unsafe, uncomfortable, and expensive. Providing substitutive hospital‐level care in a patient's home potentially reduces cost while improving quality and safety, although evidence from randomized controlled trials is lacking. METHODS: We piloted a randomized controlled trial of acute hospital‐level care at home versus usual care at an academic medical center. Patients who presented to the emergency department with any infection, heart failure exacerbation, or COPD/asthma exacerbation were eligible to enroll and be randomized only after an admission decision was made. Patients were excluded if they lived over 5 miles away or were medically unstable by several disease‐specific risk scores. Patients randomized to home received at least 1 daily physician visit, 2 daily nurse visits, 24/7 video and text contact with clinicians, continuous vital signs monitoring, medications by any route, and portable diagnostics. Additional services were tailored to each patient as needed, such as physical therapy, social work, and food delivery. Our primary outcome was direct cost of the acute care episode. We calculated cost by totaling non‐physician labor, supplies, medications, labs, radiology, and transport. We secondarily studied utilization (eg, labs, consultations) during the care episode, 30‐day post‐discharge cost and utilization, and quality and safety (eg, adverse events, sleep, physical activity [objective data via vital signs monitor]). We compared groups with Mann‐Whitney and Fisher exact tests. We present cost data as percent change from control. RESULTS: Nine patients (2 female, 4 white) randomized to home had amedian age of 65 (IQR, 28) years; 11 patients (8 female, 5 white) randomized to control had a median age of 60 (IQR, 29) years. Median direct cost of the acute care episode for home patients was 52% (IQR, 28%; p = 0.05) lower than for control patients. Median length of stay was 3.0 days in both groups (p = 0.8). During the care episode, home patients had fewer lab orders (median per admission: 6 vs 19; p < 0.01) and less often received consultations (0% vs 27%; p = 0.04). At 30‐ days post‐discharge, median direct cost for home patients was 67% (IQR, 77%; p < 0.01) lower, with trends toward less use of home care services (22% vs 55%; p = 0.20) and fewer readmissions (11% vs 36%; p = 0.32). No safety events occurred in home patients; 1 control patient had hypokalemia. Home patients were more active (median min of activity per day, 209 vs 78; p < 0.01), with a trend toward more sleep (median hours per day, 5.4 vs 4.1; p =0.3). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized controlled pilot of patients admitted with acute illness, the use of substitutive home hospitalization compared to usual care in the hospital reduced cost and utilization and improved patient activity. Preliminary results suggest quality and safety were maintained or improved, with more definitive results awaiting a larger trial.

AB: Both mobile apps and responsive‐design websites (web apps) can be used to deliver mobile health (mHealth) interventions, but it can be difficult to discern which to use in research. The goal of this paper is to present four case studies from behavioral interventions that developed either a mobile app or a web app for research and present an information table to help researchers determine which mobile option would work best for them. Four behavioral intervention case studies (two developed a mobile app, and two developed a web app) presented include time, cost, and expertise. Considerations for adopting a mobile app or a web app‐such as time, cost, access to programmers, data collection, security needs, and intervention components‐ are presented. Future studies will likely integrate both mobile app and web app modalities. The considerations presented here can help guide researchers on which platforms to choose prior to starting an mHealth intervention.

AB: Women's College Hospital (WCH) in Toronto offers specialized ambulatory surgical procedures. A feasibility study using a mobile appliciation (app) to supplement in‐person follow‐up care after surgery suggests that the mobile app adequately detects postoperative complications, eliminates the need for in‐person follow‐up care and is cost‐effective. This is concordant with other postoperative telemedicine studies. The purpose of this study is to determine if we can avert in‐person follow‐up care through the use of mobile app compared to conventional, in‐person follow‐up care in the first month following surgery amongst breast reconstruction patients at WCH. This will be a pragmatic, single‐centre, open, controlled, 2‐arm parallel‐group superiority randomized trial. Mobile app follow‐up care is a novel approach to managing patients postoperatively with the potential to avert in‐person follow‐up and generate cost‐savings for the healthcare system and patient.

CC: Hypertension
KY: Hypertension
AB: Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The ultimate goal of hypertension treatment is to lower blood pressure (BP) and thereby reduce cardiovascular risk. Despite the risks of hypertension and availability of effective treatment, a substantial number of patients have uncontrolled BP. Systematic reviews have shown that Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) produces modest improvements in BP control and that HBPM yields greater benefits when combined with other interventions such as remote titration change or adherence‐enhancing strategies. The effectiveness of HBPM is tempered because many patients with access to home BP monitors fail to regularly measure their BP or respond appropriately to high readings. New technology has made tele‐monitoring of patient health feasible and has allowed for measurement and transmission of patient BP and other patient information from the home to a health care provider. An additional strategy to further improve the compliance of the patients with their hypertension management plan is to provide them with a clearer short term benefit, rewarding compliance. For example, those who achieve BP within the target range could receive a financial incentive. The investigators' strategy to improve the effectiveness of HBPM to reduce BP is to use the full potential of wireless and mobile technology to create automatic feedback loops between the patient and the health care provider. The investigators propose a 6‐month randomized controlled trial with 224 hypertensive patients with uncontrolled BP from the SingHealth Polyclinics in Bedok and Marine Parade, Singapore. The proposed trial will be a parallel study with one control arm and two intervention arms in ratio of 2:3:3 with the objective of measuring the incremental effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of an intervention with Wireless HBPM System, with and without financial incentives, compared to non‐wireless HBPM alone. Specifically, the investigators have the following primary aims and hypotheses: A1: Determine whether a Wireless HBPM System with and without financial incentives is effective at reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared to a non‐wireless HBPM that relies on patient self‐reporting and best practices (Usual Care, UC). H1a: The average reduction in SBP at 6 months will be greater for the patients in the intervention arms (Wireless HBPM System with and without Incentives) compared to UC patients. H1b: The average reduction in SBP at 6 months will be greater for the patients in the Wireless HBPM System with incentives arm compared to those in the Wireless HBPM System without incentives arm. As well as the following secondary aims and hypotheses: A2: Determine whether a Wireless HBPM System with and without financial incentives is effective at reducing diastolic blood pressure (DBP) compared to a non‐wireless HBPM that relies on patient self‐reporting and best practices (Usual Care, UC). H2a: The average reduction in DBP at 6 months will be greater for the patients in the intervention arms (Wireless HBPM System with and without incentives) compared to UC patients. H2b: The average reduction in DBP at 6 months will be greater for the patients in the Wireless HBPM System with incentives arm compared to those in the Wireless HBPM System without incentives arm. A3: Quantify the incremental cost‐effectiveness of Wireless HBPM System without incentives compared with UC, and of Wireless HBPM System with incentives compared to Wireless HBPM without Incentives. H3a: The Incremental Cost‐Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of Wireless HBPM System without incentives compared to UC will be favorable relative to international benchmarks for cost‐effectiveness analysis. H3b: The ICER of Wireless HBPM System with incentives compared to Wireless HBPM System without incentives will be favorable relative to other published RCTs with primary aim of reducing SBP. A4: Determine whether a Wireless HBPM System with and without financial incentives is effective at decreasing patient non‐adherence to BP self‐monitoring and hypertensive medicines compared to a non‐wireless HBPM that relies on patient self‐reporting and best practices (Usual Care, UC). H4a, H4b: The average number of missing BP measurements (H4a) and percentage of medication doses not taken (H4b) during the last month of the study will be smaller for the patients in the intervention arms (Wireless HBPM System with and without incentives) compared to UC patients. H4c, H4d: The average number of missing BP measurements (H4c) and percentage of medication doses not taken (H4d) during the last month of the study will be smaller for the patients in the Wireless HBPM System with incentives arm compared to those in the Wireless HBPM System without incentives arm. A5: Determine whether financial incentives framed as health capital is effective at decreasing patient non‐adherence to BP self‐monitoring compared to financial incentives framed as a reward. H5: The average number of missing BP measurements over the intervention period will be smaller for the patients in the Health Capital sub‐arm compared to those in the Instant Reward sub‐arm.

AB: BACKGROUND: Teledermoscopy involves the use of dermoscopic images for remote consultation and decision‐making in skin cancer screening. OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze the potential benefits gained from the addition of dermoscopic images to an internet‐based skin cancer screening system. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial assessed the diagnostic performance and cost‐effectiveness of clinical teleconsultations (CTC) and clinical with dermoscopic teleconsultations. RESULTS: A total of 454 patients were enrolled in the trial (nCTC = 226, nclinical with dermoscopic teleconsultation = 228). Teledermoscopy improved sensitivity and specificity (92.86% and 96.24%, respectively) compared with CTC (86.57% and 72.33%, respectively). Correct decisions were made in 94.30% of patients through clinical with dermoscopic teleconsultations and in 79.20% in CTC (P < .001). The only variable associated with an increased likelihood of correct diagnosis was management using teledermoscopy (odds ratio 4.04; 95% confidence interval 2.02‐8.09; P < .0001). The cost‐effectiveness analysis showed teledermoscopy as the dominant strategy, with a lower cost‐effectiveness ratio (65.13 vs 80.84). LIMITATIONS: Potentially, a limitation is the establishment of an experienced dermatologist as the gold standard for the in‐person evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of dermoscopic images significantly improves the results of an internet‐based skin cancer screening system, compared with screening systems based on clinical images alone.

AB: Background: Menopausal symptoms are common and may be particularly severe in younger women who undergo treatment‐induced menopause. Medications to reduce menopausal symptoms are either contra‐indicated or have bothersome side effects. Previous studies have demonstrated that face‐to‐face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in alleviating menopausal symptoms in women with breast cancer. However, compliance with face‐to‐face CBT programs can be problematic. A promising approach is to use the Internet to make this form of CBT more accessible and feasible for patients. This study is evaluating the efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of an Internet‐based CBT program, with or without therapist guidance, in alleviating or reducing the severity of menopausal symptoms. Methods/design: In a multicenter, randomized controlled trial we are evaluating the efficacy of two Internet‐based CBT programs in alleviating or reducing the impact of menopausal symptoms, and particularly hot flushes and night sweats, in breast cancer survivors who have experienced a treatment‐induced menopause. Secondary outcomes include sexual functioning, sleep quality, hot flush frequency, psychological distress, health‐related quality of life and cost‐effectiveness. We will recruit 248 women who will be randomized to either a therapist guided or a self‐management version of the 6‐week Internet‐based CBT program, or to a usual care, waiting list control group. Self‐administered questionnaires are completed at baseline (T0), and at 10 weeks (T1) and 24 weeks (T2) post‐randomization. Discussion: Internet‐based CBT is a potentially useful treatment for reducing menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors. This study will provide evidence on the efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of such an Internet‐based CBT program, with or without therapist support. If demonstrated to be efficacious and cost‐effective, the availability of such structured supportive intervention programs will be a welcome addition to standard medical treatment offered to cancer patients with treatment‐induced menopause. Trial registration: The study is retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on January 26th 2016 (NCT02672189). Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).

AB: OBJECTIVE: South Africa has one of the highest human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence rates in the world, but despite the well‐established benefits of HIV counseling and testing (HCT), there is low uptake of HCT. The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of using short message services (SMSs) to encourage HCT while interrogating the impact of altering SMS content and dosage (the number of SMSs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: About 2,533 participants were recruited via an SMS sent to 24,000 mobiles randomly sampled from a pre‐existing database. Recruits were randomly allocated to four intervention groups that received 3 or 10 informational (INFO) or motivational (MOTI) SMSs, and a control group. After the intervention, participants were prompted to go for HCT, and postintervention assessment was done after 3 weeks. RESULTS: In comparison with the control, receipt of 10 MOTI messages had the most impact on uptake of HCT with a 1.7‐fold increased odds of testing (confidence interval 95%; p=0.0036). The lack of efficacy of three SMSs indicates a threshold effect, that is, a minimum number of MOTI SMSs is required. INFO SMSs, whether 3 or 10 were sent, did not have a statistically significant effect. The cost can be calculated for the marginal effect of the SMSs, that is, the cost to get people to test over and above those who were likely to test without the intervention. Use of 10 MOTI SMSs yielded a cost‐per‐tester of $2.41. CONCLUSIONS: While there are methodological issues apparent in our study, the results demonstrate the potential of SMSs to influence the uptake of HCT, the importance of appropriate content, and the need to determine a threshold for SMS‐based interventions. These results indicate a potential for SMSs to be used more generally for interventions encouraging people to take health‐related actions, and the need for further research in this field. The reasonable cost‐per‐tester is promising for the scale‐up of such an intervention.

AB: Adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) represent an underserved segment of the US population with a high prevalence of obesity and limited options for weight management. Previous research has demonstrated clinically meaningful weight loss of 7% of total body weight in in adults with IDD using an enhanced Stop Light Diet (eSLD) in combination with monthly at‐home face‐to‐face (FTF) behavioral sessions, and a recommendation for increased physical activity. However, the time and cost associated with FTF delivery (travel + sessions) limits the potential for scaling and implementation and suggests the need for the evaluation of less costly and burdensome strategies for intervention delivery. Therefore, we will conduct a 24‐mo. randomized trial to compare a weight management intervention (6 mos. weight loss, 12 mos. maintenance, 6 mos. no‐contact follow‐up) delivered to 120 overweight/obese adults with IDD in their home, either remotely (RD) using video conferencing on a tablet computer, or during FTF visits. Our primary aim is whether RD is non‐inferior to FTF for weight loss (0–6 mos.). Secondarily, we will compare the RD and FTF groups on mean weight loss, the proportion of participants who achieve clinically meaningful weight loss, and changes in quality of life across 24 months. We will also conduct cost analysis, cost‐effectiveness, and contingent valuation analyses to compare the RD and FTF groups.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To determine if self‐monitoring via home‐based telehealth equipment could, when combined with ongoing remote monitoring by a nurse, reduce the incidence of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) presentations for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was used to compare the outcomes for participants receiving the telehealth equipment and monitoring with those for participants in an information‐only control group, over a period of 6 months. Participants receiving the telehealth intervention were taught to measure and record their vital signs (blood pressure, weight, temperature, pulse, and oxygen saturation levels) on a daily basis. These were then transmitted automatically via telephone to a secure Web site where they were monitored each day by the telehealth nurse. RESULTS: The telehealth group had fewer ED presentations and hospital admissions and a reduced length of stay in comparison with the control group. These results were not statistically significant. However, the reduction in health service use was large enough to result in significant cost savings, with the annual cost savings of the telehealth group compared with the control group being $2,931 per person. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth monitoring of patient vital signs reduced health service utilization for individuals with COPD and resulted in significant cost savings. In terms of individual health benefits, improvements in participants' self‐management behaviors and control over their condition was evident.

AB: BACKGROUND: Resistance training programs have been found to improve muscle strength, physical function, and depressive symptoms in middle‐aged and older adults. These programs have typically been provided in clinical facilities, health clubs, and senior centers, which may be inconvenient and/or cost prohibitive for some older adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an automated telemedicine intervention that provides real‐time guidance and monitoring of resistance training in the home. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial in 103 middle‐aged or older participants. Participants were assigned to use of a theory‐driven interactive voice response system designed to promote resistance training (Telephone‐Linked Computer‐based Long‐term Interactive Fitness Trainer; n = 52) or to an attention control (n = 51) for a period of 12 months. Measurements of muscle strength, balance, walk distance, and mood were obtained at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: We observed increased strength, improved balance, and fewer depressive symptoms in the intervention group than in the control group. Using generalized estimating equations modeling, group differences were statistically significant for knee flexion strength (p = .035), single‐leg stance time (p = .029), and Beck Depression Inventory (p = .030). CONCLUSIONS: This computer‐based telecommunications exercise intervention led to improvements in participants' strength, balance, and depressive symptoms. Because of their low cost and easy accessibility, computer‐based interventions may be a cost‐effective way of promoting exercise in the home.

AB: Self‐management strategies improve a variety of health‐related outcomes for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These strategies, however, are primarily designed to improve chronic disease management and have not focused on early detection and early treatment of exacerbations. In COPD, the majority of exacerbations go unreported and treatment is frequently delayed, resulting in worsened outcomes. Therefore, a randomised clinical trial was designed to determine whether integration of self‐management education with proactive remote disease monitoring would improve health‐related outcomes. A total of 40 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage 3 or 4 COPD patients were randomised to receive proactive integrated care (PIC) or usual care (UC) over a 3‐month period. The primary and secondary outcomes were change in quality of life, measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and change in healthcare costs. PIC dramatically improved SGRQ by 10.3 units, compared to 0.6 units in the UC group. Healthcare costs declined in the PIC group by US$1,401, compared with an increase of US$1,709 in the UC group, but this was not statistically significant. PIC uncovered nine exacerbations, seven of which were unreported. Therefore, proactive integrated care has the potential to improve outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients through effects of self‐management, as well as early detection and treatment of exacerbations.

AB: AIM: To analyse how web‐based consultations for parents of children with atopic dermatitis affect self‐management behaviour, health outcome, health resource use and family costs. METHODS: Ninety‐eight children with atopic dermatitis were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The intervention group received remote dermatology consultations through a secure web‐based communication system. The control group was encouraged to seek treatment through traditional means such as general practitioner visits and hospital care. Both groups received an extensive individual educational session prior to the intervention. RESULTS: Thirty‐eight percent of the intervention group used web‐based consultations 158 times ranging from 1 to 38 consultations per patient. We found no change in self‐management behaviour, health outcome or costs. The intervention group tended to have fewer visits to practitioners offering complementary therapies than the control group, and we found a positive correlation between emergency visits at baseline and messages sent. Both groups, however, reduced the mean number of skin care treatments performed per week and had fewer total health care visits after the intervention. CONCLUSION: We found no effect of supplementing traditional treatment for childhood dermatitis with web‐based consultations. This study showed that web consultations is feasible, but more research is needed to determine its effect on self‐management skills, health outcome and resource use.

AB: Sudden cardiac death (SCD), usually due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia, is the most common cause of death in the United States. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has been shown to improve the survival of patients with a history of a heart attack and a weak heart (functioning at 30% or less) and those with symptomatic congestive heart failure symptoms (hearts functioning at 35% or less). Thus, the number of patients who will require ICD therapy is expected to rise exponentially over the next several years. To facilitate the follow‐up of patients with ICDs, device companies have launched systems for remote monitoring of these devices. One such system is the Medtronic Carelink Monitor. Although this system has been proven in a multicenter, prospective study to be easy to use, it is not known whether this monitor results in improved patients' outcomes and satisfaction and in reduced healthcare costs. Comparison: Patient outcomes, costs, and satisfaction will be evaluated, comparing patients assigned to follow‐up using the Medtronic Carelink Monitor versus quarterly visits to an outpatient clinic.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effectiveness of telemedicine (TM) with digital cameras in treating wounds in a home care setting. DESIGN: Randomized controlled study. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: One hundred three subjects with 160 pressure ulcers (PrUs) or nonhealing surgical wounds referred to a metropolitan Visiting Nurse Agency. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Group A (n = 40): weekly visits with TM and wound care specialist (WCS) consults; group B (n = 28): weekly visits with weekly consults with WCSs; and group C (n = 35): usual and customary care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were time to heal, costs, length of stay (LOS), nursing visits, wound status, and change in size. RESULTS: There was a similar distribution of subject characteristics in all 3 groups, but group A had disproportionally larger and more numerous PrUs and larger nonhealing surgical wounds. Group A had increased time to heal, LOS, costs, and visits compared with groups B and C; wound status was similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Uneven distribution of severity and type of wounds among groups, with greatest percentage of large wounds in TM group. Larger wounds consume more resources. TM is a useful communication tool in wound management but with limited power when randomization does not include wound size or type. Two important benchmarks were established for home care. First, it took 51 days, on average, to heal or improve PrUs and 34 days to heal or improve surgical wounds regardless of group. Second, nearly 90% of wounds improved or healed.

AB: BACKGROUND: falls in hospitals are a major problem and contribute to substantial healthcare burden. Advances in sensor technology afford innovative approaches to reducing falls in acute hospital care. However, whether these are clinically effective and cost effective in the UK setting has not been evaluated. METHODS: pragmatic, parallel‐arm, individual randomised controlled trial of bed and bedside chair pressure sensors using radio‐pagers (intervention group) compared with standard care (control group) in elderly patients admitted to acute, general medical wards, in a large UK teaching hospital. Primary outcome measure number of in‐patient bedside falls per 1,000 bed days. RESULTS: 1,839 participants were randomised (918 to the intervention group and 921 to the control group). There were 85 bedside falls (65 fallers) in the intervention group, falls rate 8.71 per 1,000 bed days compared with 83 bedside falls (64 fallers) in the control group, falls rate 9.84 per 1,000 bed days (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66‐1.22; P = 0.51). There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to time to first bedside fall (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.95; 95% CI: 0.67‐1.34; P= 0.12). The mean cost per patient in the intervention group was £7199 compared with £6400 in the control group, mean difference in QALYs per patient, 0.0001 (95% CI: ‐0.0006‐0.0004, P= 0.67). CONCLUSIONS: bed and bedside chair pressure sensors as a single intervention strategy do not reduce in‐patient bedside falls, time to first bedside fall and are not cost‐effective in elderly patients in acute, general medical wards in the UK.

AB: Aims To evaluate the effect of telemonitoring on adherence to non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Methods and results A randomized, single‐blind, crossover, controlled trial in 48 AF patients on once or twice daily (OD or BID) NOAC. The Medication Event Monitoring System tracked NOAC intake during three phases of 3 months each: daily telemonitoring, telemonitoring with immediate telephone feedback in case of intake errors, and an observation phase without daily transmissions. Unprotected days were defined as ≥ 3 or ≥ 1 consecutively missed doses for a BID or OD NOAC, respectively, or excess dose intake. Cost‐effectiveness was calculated based on anticipated stroke reduction derived from patients' risk profile and measured intake. Persistence over the entire study was 98%. Telemonitoring‐only already led to very high taking and regimen adherence (97.4% respectively 93.8%). Nevertheless, direct feedback further improved both to 99.0% and 96.8%, respectively (P < 0.001 respectively P = 0.002). Observation without daily monitoring resulted in a significant waning of taking adherence (94.3%; P = 0.049). Taking adherence was significantly higher for OD compared to BID NOAC, although unprotected days were similar. Feedback intervention had an incremental cost of €344 289 to prevent one stroke, but this could be as low as €15 488 in high‐risk patients with low adherence and optimized technology. Conclusion Telemonitoring resulted in high NOAC adherence due to the notion of being watched, as evidenced by the rapid decline during the observation period. Feedback further optimized adherence. Telemonitoring with or without feedback may be a cost‐effective approach in high‐risk patients deemed poorly adherent.

KY: Heart Failure
AB: The insuﬁcie `ncia Cardı´aca Optimitzacio ´ Remota (iCOR; Heart Failure Remote Optimization) trial was a singlecentre, randomized, open‐label study designed to evaluate the eﬃcacy of the addition of telemedicine (telemonitorization and teleintervention using videoconference) to an existing specialized, multidisciplinary, nurse‐based, hospitalprimary care integrated HF programme for high‐risk patients with CHF. The organizational characteristics of the programme and the impact in health outcomes resulting from its implementation have been previously published.2 In this study we aimed to compare the strategy of providing nurse‐based structured follow‐up to high‐risk CHF patients through planned contacts between health care providers and patients and/or caregivers in the basis of face‐to‐face on‐site encounters (usual care in our HF programme) or provide the planned care using telemedicine with the combination of remote daily monitoring of signs and symptoms of HF (telemonitoring) and delivery of structured nursebased follow‐up health care using videoconference (teleintervention). The main hypothesis of this study was that adding telemedicine to an existing HF programme would be associated with a reduction in the number of non‐fatal HF events in high‐risk patients with CHF. As a secondary hypothesis we assumed that adding telemedicine would translate into a reduction in health care resource utilization and subsequently in health care costs.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To explore the experiences of patients and professionals taking part in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of blood glucose, blood pressure (BP) and weight telemonitoring in type 2 diabetes supported by primary care, and identify factors facilitating or hindering the effectiveness of the intervention and those likely to influence its potential translation to routine practice. DESIGN: Qualitative study adopting an interpretive descriptive approach. PARTICIPANTS: 23 patients, 6 nurses and 4 doctors who were participating in a RCT of blood glucose and BP telemonitoring. A maximum variation sample of patients from within the trial based on age, sex and deprivation status of the practice was sought. SETTING: 12 primary care practices in Scotland and England. METHOD: Data were collected via recorded semistructured interviews. Analysis was inductive with themes presented within an overarching thematic framework. Multiple strategies were employed to ensure that the analysis was credible and trustworthy. RESULTS: Telemonitoring of blood glucose, BP and weight by people with type 2 diabetes was feasible. The data generated by telemonitoring supported self‐care decisions and medical treatment decisions. Motivation to self‐manage diet was increased by telemonitoring of blood glucose, and the 'benign policing' aspect of telemonitoring was considered by patients to be important. The convenience of home monitoring was very acceptable to patients although professionals had some concerns about telemonitoring increasing workload and costs. CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring of blood glucose, BP and weight in primary care is a promising way of improving diabetes management which would be highly acceptable to the type of patients who volunteered for this study.

AB: We studied the effect of telemonitoring in addition to usual care compared to usual care alone in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A total of 110 patients with moderate to severe COPD were recruited from a specialist respiratory service in Northern Ireland. Patients had at least two of: emergency department admissions, hospital admissions or emergency general practitioner (GP) contacts in the 12 months before the study. Exclusion criteria were patients who had any respiratory disorder other than COPD, or were cognitively unable to learn the process of monitoring. Patients were randomised to receive six months of home telemonitoring with usual care, or six months of usual care. The primary outcome measure was disease‐specific quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ‐C). Of 100 patients completing the study, 48 patients were randomised to telemonitoring and 52 patients were randomised to the control group. The SGRQ‐C scores improved significantly in the intervention group compared to usual care (P = 0.001). The HADS anxiety score was significantly higher in the telehealth group compared to the usual care group (P = 0.01). There were significantly more contacts with the Community Respiratory Team in the telemonitoring group compared to the control group (P = 0.029). There were no significant between group differences in EQ‐5D scores, HADS depression scores, GP activity, emergency department visits, hospital admissions or exacerbations. The total cost to the health service of the intervention over the 6‐month study period was £2039, giving an estimated ICER of £203,900. In selected patients with COPD, telemonitoring was effective in improving health‐related quality of life and anxiety, but was not a cost‐effective intervention.

AB: The study is designed to evaluate the impact of telemonitoring on the follow‐up of elderly patients with one or more chronic diseases among heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes. The particular target of patients selected has the particularity of being "frail" according to a set of social eligibility criteria, agreed by the clinicians participating at the study. General practitioners are the first clinicians in charge of managing these patients during the trial follow‐up. The term of comparison is represented by a control group, followed by outpatient usual care. From a clinical point of view, the trial will investigate how the remote monitoring of some clinical parameters contributes to reduce the access to healthcare facilities (emergency and planned hospitalization, bed‐days, ER, specialist and GP visits), to improve the patients health‐related quality of life and to reduce the anxiety about health conditions. A cost‐effectiveness and cost‐utility analysis will be carried out in order to determine if and how telemonitoring helps to limit the healthcare expenditure. The evaluation will deal also with organizational changes and task shift due to telemonitoring introduction and patients and professionals perception towards the service.

TI: SymptomCare@Home: deconstructing an Effective Symptom Management Intervention
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02779725
YR: 2016
AB: Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy experience multiple poorly controlled symptoms at home in the interim weeks between clinic visits and the next infusion. Their care during this interim time period is suboptimal. Technology can be utilized to bridge the gap between patient symptom needs at home and oncology team response. Automated patient‐reported symptom home monitoring and management systems offer a new approach to symptom care. Our research team has developed and tested SymptomCare@Home (SCH). This multi‐component automated system monitors daily patient‐reported symptoms at home, provides tailored automated self‐management coaching based on the specific symptoms reported and transmits unrelieved symptom alert reports to an oncology provider who, using the SCH decision support system provides follow‐up telephone‐delivered symptom care. We have demonstrated that SCH dramatically reduces physical and psychological symptom severity. However there remain several gaps in translating a successful, multi‐component symptom intervention into clinical practice. These include understanding 1) the contribution and value of each part of the intervention so that the active components are selected for clinical implementation and 2) the costs associated with the intervention and its components. Therefore the aims of this project are to deconstruct the SCH symptom monitoring and management system to determine the relative contribution and costs of its components to achieving symptom reduction, maintain general health functioning and reduce healthcare utilization. We will also examine who benefits most and least from the individual components and from the overall system. A 5 group randomized control trial design will be utilized with 750 participants (150/group) beginning a new course of chemotherapy who will call the SCH system daily and report the presence and severity of 11 symptoms throughout a course of chemotherapy or up to 6 months. This study is both significant and innovative because it shifts the current clinical practice paradigm for providing symptom care episodically during clinic visits to an innovative approach that is patient‐centric, providing symptom care when and where the patient needs it. The study will address questions not generally asked in multi‐component interventions, determining the active ingredients and their costs. Determining the value of new approaches to care such as automated telehealth interventions is essential to the decision process of healthcare systems and payers who decide what to adopt and reimburse. It is also vitally important to patients so that new symptom care innovations are adopted that better meet their needs and dramatically reduce their symptoms.

AB: Many hospitals in remote areas lack an endocrinology consult service. We performed a study to evaluate whether inpatient glucose management by telemedicine was safe and effective. Patients hospitalized in a medically underserved area in Texas were randomized to receive care by endocrinologists via telemedicine (TELE; N=29) or non‐endocrinologists by usual care (UC; N=28). Patients in the TELE group were treated with basal bolus therapy unless clinical circumstances dictated otherwise. The UC group received all care, including insulin management, from their hospitalist team. Point‐of‐care blood glucose (BG) readings were obtained pre‐meal, bedtime and occasionally at 0300. BG readings obtained within one hour of previous readings were excluded to avoid ascertainment bias. Hospital day one readings were also excluded. Results are shown in the Table. The TELE group had significantly more BGs in the target range, fewer BGs in the higher than target range, and no differences in hypoglycemia as compared to the UC group. Conclusion: Endocrinology care via telemedicine is feasible in hospitals that lack an endocrinology consult service. This intervention improves glycemic control in hospitalized patients. Further large trials will be necessary to evaluate other health outcomes and cost‐effectiveness. (Table Presented).

TI: Effects of Tele- or In-person Prehabilitation in Candidates Awaiting Total Hip or Knee Arthroplasty
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02636751
YR: 2015
KY: Osteoarthritis
AB: BACKGROUND Osteoarthritis (OA) is a very common disorder that affects almost every Canadian over 65 years of age. Future estimations indicate the incidence of OA will increase by at least 26% over the next 30 years in Canada. Hip and knee are the most affected joints by OA and these conditions incur important disability. Lower limb OA is initially treated conservatively with therapeutic interventions such as physical activity modification, exercise, weight control, and medication. Surgical interventions such as total joint arthroplasty (TJA) have been proven a treatment of choice for the most severe cases. However, the accessibility to such surgery often comes up against long wait lists, and prolonged wait time may lead to deleterious effects on the health status and quality of life of the awaiting patients. Prehabilitation refers to education and exercising before a surgery. Attention to prehabilitation has increased in the last decade and a growing body of evidence suggests that it could have a positive effect on postoperative outcomes and may reduce disabilities before and after surgery for a number of conditions. In the context of prehabilitation for TJA, trials have already shown that a rehabilitation exercise program before a TJA could lead to a shorter hospitalisation length of stay, in addition to increased muscle strength and range of motion following a total hip or knee arthroplasty. However, results concerning the longer‐term effects of prehabilitation after a TJA tend to be inconsistent and further research is actually needed to better understand the effects of prehabilitation over the post‐surgical course. As the aging population and the constant increase in chronic diseases keep pressuring the healthcare systems worldwide, lack of resources tends to lengthen wait time for surgery like TJA. Long wait times for such medical interventions have a negative impact on pain, function and quality of life. Policymakers have therefore been searching for a care optimisation strategy to improve healthcare accessibility to prehabilitation. Among the solutions stands the use of technology to help deliver more efficiently rehabilitation services or to improve access to these types of care. Telerehabilitation has gained increased recognition and it is defined as the provision of rehabilitation services at a distance, using information and communication technologies. Previous studies have already shown that telerehabilitation programs are feasible in a home‐care setting. Tousignant et al. demonstrated that a telerehabilitation program was as efficient and less expensive than conventional physiotherapy after a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Bedra et al. qualified as viable a home‐based telerehabilitation program after a hip fracture, while Anton et al. demonstrated that a Kinect™‐based system can be an adjuvant to physiotherapy after a total hip replacement. Those programs present good opportunities for optimising the delivery of care in community rehabilitation, especially by increasing the number of patients seen in a single day, by reducing medical costs and travel time, and by providing access to medical care otherwise unavailable in rural areas. However, no study, to our knowledge, analysed the outcome of telerehabilitation before proceeding to a total joint replacement. This pilot single blind randomized controlled trial aims therefore to evaluate the feasibility and the impact on pain and disabilities of a telerehabilitation prehabilitation program for patients awaiting a total joint (hip or knee) arthroplasty compared to in‐person prehabilitation or to usual care. Our hypothesis is that a 12‐week prehabilitation program will significantly increase functional mobility and quality of life for the subjects in the experimental groups, but not in the control group. EXAMINATION PROCEDURE AND RANDOMIZATION During the baseline evaluation at the Maisonneuve‐Rosemont Research Center, eligible participants will complete a questionnaire covering sociodemographic status, comorbidities, and medication usage. Patients will be asked to fill in four French validated self‐reported questionnaires: the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS‐CF), the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC‐CF), the Short Form Health Survey (SF‐36‐CF) and a Global Rating of Change Scale (GRC‐CF). Three physical functional performance measures will also be collected: the self‐paced walk (SPW), the timed up‐and‐go (TUG) and timed stair tests (ST). These tests are oriented toward activities of daily living and have been validated with a geriatric population. They are reliable, reproducible, and responsive to change. They also have widely been used for measuring the outcomes of patients undergoing a TJA. An online version of the questionnaires using the Survey Monkey® platform or a paper version will be provided to the participants. Finally, a logbook will be given to the participants. They will be asked to record the exercises executed at home, including the number of series and repetitions, in addition to the medication intake. This logbook will allow a monitoring of the compliance rate to the programs and also the advent of any adverse effects. Patients will then be randomly assigned to the control group or to one of the two experimental groups. An independent research assistant, blind to the baseline evaluation results, will open the randomization envelope indicating the participant's assignment to a group. A random number generator will be used to establish randomization lists prior to the initiation of the study. A member of the research team, not involved with data collection, will generate the randomization list. Blocked randomization of 6 will be used to make sure that three equal groups of 12 subjects participants are obtained. Participants will be reassessed at 12 weeks by a blind research assistant, after the completion of the interventions. The same evaluation tools as at baseline will be used, according to a standardized procedure. A satisfaction questionnaire about the telecommunication software experience will be filled by participants and therapists who used a telecommunication software.

AB: With expanding indications for cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) capable of treating bradycardias, complex cardiac tachyarrhythmias and heart failure, the number of patients requiring regular long‐term specialized care is growing rapidly. Currently, routine face‐to‐face follow‐up consultations for patients with CIEDs are a significant burden on hospital services. Remote telemonitoring appears to offer a safe and effective alternative to conventional follow‐up in this area. The Medtronic CareLink Network enables remote monitoring of CIED patients, and thus has the potential to improve the efficiency of medical care in this population. The objective of the PORTLink (PORTuguese Research on Telemonitoring with CareLink) multicenter randomized trial is to assess the safety, efficacy and costs of remote CIED monitoring compared to traditional face‐to‐face follow‐up. It will evaluate aspects such as physicians' and patients' acceptance of and satisfaction with reviewing device data via the website, the complexity for troubleshooting calls to the support center, the use of emergency resources bysymptomatic patients, the incidence of unscheduled consultations after remote interrogations, levels of anxiety, depression and quality of life, and the main resources used by the CareLink sys‐tem.

AB: BACKGROUND: Non‐invasive ventilation (NIV) is an efficient method for treating respiratory failure in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, it requires a process of adaptation not always achieved due to poor compliance. The role of telemonitoring of NIV is not yet established. OBJECTIVES: To test the advantage of using modem communication in NIV of ALS patients. DESIGN: Prospective, single blinded controlled trial. Population and methods According to their residence, 40 consecutive ventilated ALS patients were assigned to one of two groups: a control group (G1, n=20) in which compliance and ventilator parameter settings were assessed during office visits; or an intervention group (G2, n=20) in which patients received a modem device connected to the ventilator. The number of office and emergency room visits and hospital admissions during the entire span of NIV use and the number of parameter setting changes to achieve full compliance were the primary outcome measurements. RESULTS: Demographic and clinical features were similar between the two groups at admission. No difference in compliance was found between the groups. The incidence of changes in parameter settings throughout the survival period with NIV was lower in G2 (p<0.0001) but it was increased during the initial period needed to achieve full compliance. The number of office or emergency room visits and inhospital admissions was significantly lower in G2 (p<0.0001). Survival showed a trend favouring G2 (p=0.13). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that telemonitoring reduces health care utilisation with probable favourable implications on costs, survival and functional status.

AB: AIMS: We evaluate the efficacy of the "Active Body Control (ABC) Program" for weight reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The ABC program combines telemonitoring of the physical activity with a low‐calorie diet also preferring carbohydrates with low glycemic indexes. In this 6‐month, randomized, clinical trial 35 patients (aged 57 ± 9 years; BMI=35.3 ± 5.7 kg/m(2)) were treated according to the ABC program and 35 control patients (aged 58 ± 7 years; BMI=34.8 ± 5.9 kg/m(2)) received standard therapy. RESULTS: After 6 months the mean weight loss in the intervention group was 11.8 kg ± 8.0 kg. Glucose and HbA1c were lowered by respectively 1.0 mmol/l and 0.8 percentage points (p=0.000, respectively). The proportion of patients with HbA1c>7% fell from 57% to 26%. Antidiabetic drugs were discontinued in 13 patients (39%) and reduced in 14 (42%). The reduction of costs on medication per patient was € 83 in 6 months. In the control group, there were no relevant changes in body weight, laboratory values or drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The ABC program effectively lowers body weight, Hb1Ac and antidiabetic drug use in patients with type 2 diabetes.

AB: BACKGROUND: Patients with high blood pressure (BP) visit a physician an average of 4 times or more per year in the U.S., yet BP is controlled in fewer than half. Practical, robust and sustainable models are needed to improve BP in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. OBJECTIVES: The Home Blood Pressure Telemonitoring and Case Management to Control Hypertension study (HyperLink) is a cluster‐randomized trial designed to determine whether an intervention that combines home BP telemonitoring with pharmacist case management improves BP control compared to usual care at 6 and 12 months in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Secondary outcomes are maintenance of BP control at 18 months, patient satisfaction with their health care, and costs of care. METHODS: HyperLink enrolled 450 hypertensive patients with uncontrolled BP from 16 primary care clinics. Eight clinics were randomized to provide usual care (UC) to their patients (n=222) and 8 were randomized to provide the telemonitoring intervention (TI) (n=228). TI patients received home BP telemonitors that internally store and electronically transmit BP data to a secure database. Pharmacist case managers adjust antihypertensive therapy based on the home BP data under a collaborative practice agreement with the clinics' primary care teams. The length of the intervention is 12 months, with follow‐up to 18 months to determine the durability of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We will test in a real primary care setting whether combining BP telemonitoring and pharmacist case management can achieve and maintain high rates of BP control compared to usual care.

AB: Even though laparoscopic cholecystectomy emerged over 20 years ago, controversies persist with regards to the best method to ligate the cystic duct and artery. We proposed to assess the safety, cost effectiveness and feasibility of different methods to close the cystic duct and artery by suture ligation versus clip application working in rural area where latest facilities are limited. Even today the latest Harmonic Scalpel and Plasma Kinetic have become popular with the promise of quick and effective vascular control, but again these are less cost‐effective and problem of availability in rural area still exists. Aim. Evaluate the effectiveness in terms of cost, safety and complications in ligation of the cystic artery and duct separately with non‐absorbable suture ligation compared to clip application. Our aim is for surgeons sitting in rural area, where latest facilities are not available, they can ligate the CD or artery using non‐absorbable suture which is cheaper and cost‐effective without encountering any bile leakage or bleeding. Silk suture can be tied near to the CBD as risk of involving the CBD wall is less as compared to clips. Settings and design. A prospective randomised double blind study. Material and methods. This was a randomised controlled prospective study carried out at a medical college hospital (in remote village) from period of January 2011 to February 2012 in India. A total number of 160 cases were selected in the study, out of which 40 cases were excluded as per the selection criteria. Patients were selected randomly and divided into two groups diagnosed as chronic cholecystitis (cho‐lelithiasis). In group A (study group‐60 cases) cystic pedicle was ligated by silk sutures 2‐0 (intracorporeal knots) while in group B (control group‐60 cases) cystic pedicle was closed with titanium clips using a clip applicator. Results. Out of total 120 patients, in group A (60 patients), cystic duct and artery were ligated separately using silk suture and in group B (60 patients) the pedicle was closed using titanium clips. The operative time in group A was 30 to 50 mins and in group B it was 30 to 40 minutes (p = 0.015). The time required for suture ligation was 6.5 ± 1.3 mins and for ligaclips it was only 4 ± 1.1mins thus decreasing the overall operative time of the procedure (p > 0.001). Drainage was required in 45 patients in A and in 40 patients in group B. It was removed on 2nd of surgery according to the colour and volume. Overall cost of procedure was more in group B as compared to group A. There was no statistically significant difference found between the two groups in terms of length of inpatient stay, post‐operative complications and safety of procedure. However, the mean operative time was lesser in whom cystic artery and duct were clipped than suture ligation. Conclusion. The ligation with suture needs more expertise than clip which is easy for trainees. It is difficult where latest and well equipped centres are there for cystic pedicles. If facilities for multiple clip sizes are not available, then silk ligature is the other option and cost‐effective, especially in rural centres.

AB: BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence and associated cost of treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unsustainable, and focus is needed on self‐management and prevention of hospital admissions. Telehealth monitoring of patients' vital signs allows clinicians to prioritise their workload and enables patients to take more responsibility for their health. This paper reports the results of a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Telehealth‐supported care within a community‐based COPD supported‐discharge service. METHODS: A two‐arm pragmatic pilot RCT was conducted comparing the standard service with a Telehealth‐supported service and assessed the potential for progressing into a full RCT. The co‐primary outcome measures were the proportion of COPD patients readmitted to hospital and changes in patients' self‐reported quality of life. The objectives were to assess the suitability of the methodology, produce a sample size calculation for a full RCT, and to give an indication of cost‐effectiveness for both pathways. RESULTS: Sixty three participants were recruited (n = 31 Standard; n = 32 Telehealth); 15 participants were excluded from analysis due to inadequate data completion or withdrawal from the Telehealth arm. Recruitment was slow with significant gaps in data collection, due predominantly to an unanticipated 60% reduction of staff capacity within the clinical team. The sample size calculation was guided by estimates of clinically important effects and COPD readmission rates derived from the literature. Descriptive analyses showed that the standard service group had a lower proportion of patients with hospital readmissions and a greater increase in self‐reported quality of life compared to the Telehealth‐supported group. Telehealth was cost‐effective only if hospital admissions data were excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Slow recruitment rates and service reconfigurations prevented progression to a full RCT. Although there are advantages to conducting an RCT with data collection conducted by a frontline clinical team, in this case, challenges arose when resources within the team were reduced by external events. Gaps in data collection were resolved by recruiting a research nurse. This study reinforces previous findings regarding the difficulty of undertaking evaluation of complex interventions, and provides recommendations for the introduction and evaluation of complex interventions within clinical settings, such as prioritisation of research within the clinical remit.

AB: INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the effects of an advanced practice nurse‐delivered telehealth intervention on health care use by children with medical complexity (CMC). Because CMC account for a large share of health care use costs, finding effective ways to care for them is an important challenge requiring exploration. METHOD: This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial with a control group and two intervention groups. The focus of the analysis was planned and unplanned clinical and therapy visits by CMC over a 30‐month data collection period. Nonparametric tests were used to compare visit counts among and within the three groups. RESULTS: The number of unplanned visits decreased over time across all groups, with the greatest decrease in the video telehealth intervention group. Planned visits were higher in the video telehealth group across all time periods. DISCUSSION: Advanced practice registered nurse‐delivered telehealth care coordination may support a shift from unplanned to planned health care service use among CMC.

AB: Mental health issues in post‐treatment adult cancer survivors are associated with multiple adverse outcomes and may represent a cancer health disparity for rural survivors. The purpose of this study is to test a stepped‐care approach tailored to symptom severity based on recent American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for reducing emotional distress (anxiety and/or depressive symptoms) and improving secondary outcomes (sleep disturbance, fatigue, fear of recurrence, quality of life) in rural, post‐treatment cancer survivors in community oncology settings and to examine intervention costs. The resultant intervention will have great potential for widespread dissemination since it will be manualized, delivered by telephone, and comprised of modules to allow customized treatments for individuals with different cancer types.

AB: The growing incidence of diabetes and the need to contain health care costs empower the necessity to identify new models to cope with regular periodic follow up of patients affected by diabetes mellitus. Telemedicine offers an acknowledged instrument to provide clinical health care at a distance, increasing patient compliance and the achievement of therapeutical goals. This study wants to verify the feasibility and the efficacy of teleconsultation in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. In particular by a randomized controlled approach the effects on glycemic control of patients followed by teleconsultation or traditionally in standard visit in the outpatient clinic. The patients in the teleconsultation group will arrange their bookings on a website (http://www.telediabete‐fid.it/) In this website they could also access to web educational courses (mainly nutrition, insulin management, glucose monitoring auto‐control) or to nutritional and psychological counselling.

AB: Persons with severe functional disabilities are the highest users of health care services. Caring for the needs of this population represents a significant percentage of our national health care costs. A growing body of research has demonstrated the efficacy of self‐management strategies and caregiver engagement for effective long‐term care for individuals with chronic medical conditions. Economic forces over the past decade have led to new challenges and resulted in major changes in health care delivery resulting in shortened length of inpatient stays and greater limits on the length of outpatient treatment. Telehealth is an innovative method for health care delivery and a means of meeting this new challenge. This article highlights the findings of 3 pilot studies on the use of telecommunications technologies in promoting self‐care management and enhancing health care outcomes in persons with severe disabilities and their family caregivers. The importance of matching technology to the needs of this population, lessons learned from these investigations, and future directions for research are addressed.

AB: BACKGROUND:: People with diabetes have a high risk of developing micro and macrovascular complications that increase treatment costs and shorten life expectancy. Telecoaching programmes can improve short‐term control of diabetes and reduce disease burden. AIMS:: To analyse the effect of a health telecoaching programme in the control of type 2 diabetes. METHODS:: A pragmatic clinical trial was carried out. Thirty‐one patients with type 2 diabetes were divided into control and intervention groups. The control group received usual nursing care, and those in the intervention group received usual care and telecoaching for 24 weeks. FINDINGS:: The intervention group improved: measurements of abdominal circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and body mass index; variables related to glycaemic control (fasting venous glucose and glycated haemoglobin/HbA1c); and high‐density lipoprotein levels. CONCLUSION:: The data indicate that telecoaching is an effective tool for diabetes management. It is recommended that the study should be developed to include more people and run over the long term.

YR: 2015
KY: Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Atrial Fibrillation
AB: The overall aim of this trial is to determine the most cost effective approach to diagnose paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) following transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke. A summary of the rationale for this study is as follows: 1. Recently completed randomized trials of cardiac monitoring following stroke have established that PAF is more common than previously recognized in cryptogenic stroke. 2. The majority of TIA/stroke patients will have at least one potential stroke mechanism identified by the time etiologic investigations completed. 3. Detecting PAF in patients with strokes with known causes (eg. lacunar and large vessel atherosclerosis) is clinically important since appropriate anticoagulation for AF reduces stroke recurrence in all patients with prior TIA/stroke not just cryptogenic strokes. 4. There are competing technologies for evaluating cardiac rhythm and diagnosing AF but no cost effectiveness data 5. The rates of PAF in strokes with known causes (SKC) have not been well characterized. PER‐DIEM is a pilot study to compare two different cardiac monitoring technologies as first line investigations to detect PAF in patients with recent stroke and TIA. The study will also assess whether a pivotal trial is feasible and warranted. The principal research questions to be addressed in this study will be: 1. What is the relative cost‐effectiveness as a first line investigation of long‐term implantable ECG (ILR) coupled with remote monitoring for 12 months compared to external event‐triggered ECG loop recorder (ELR) for 30 days in the diagnosis clinically actionable AF in following TIA/stroke. 2. What is the feasibility, patient compliance, diagnostic accuracy and rates of AF detection (>30 seconds) of ILR compared to the ELR strategies.

AB: Aims Electronic health support (e‐health) may improve self‐care of patients with heart failure (HF). We aim to assess whether an adjusted care pathway with replacement of routine consultations by e‐health improves self‐care as compared with usual care. In addition, we will determine whether the ESC/HFA (European Society of Cardiology/Heart Failure Association) website heartfailurematters.org (HFM website) improves self‐care when added to usual care. Finally, we aim to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of these interventions. Methods A three‐arm parallel randomized trial will be conducted. Arm 1 consists of usual care; arm 2 consists of usual care plus the HFM website; and arm 3 is the adjusted care pathway with an interactive platform for disease management (e‐Vita platform), with a link to the HFM website, which replaces routine consultations with HF nurses at the outpatient clinic. In total, 414 patients managed in 10 Dutch HF outpatient clinics or in general practice will be included and followed for 12 months. Participants are included if they have had an established diagnosis of HF for at least 3 months. The primary outcome is self‐care as measured by the European Heart Failure Self‐care Behaviour scale (EHFScB scale). Secondary outcomes are quality of life, cardiovascular‐ and HF‐related mortality, hospitalization, and its duration as captured by hospital and general practitioner registries, use of and user satisfaction with the HFM website, and cost‐effectiveness. Perspective This study will provide important prospective data on the impact and cost‐effectiveness of an interactive platform for disease management and the HFM website.

AB: Background: Tobacco dependence remains the leading preventable cause of death in the developed world. Smokers are disproportionately from lower socioeconomic groups, and may use the hospital emergency department (ED) as an important source of care. A recent clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of a multicomponent intervention to help smokers quit, but the independent contributions of those components is unknown. Methods: This is a full‐factorial (16‐arm) randomized trial in a busy hospital ED of 4 tobacco dependence interventions: brief motivational interviewing, nicotine replacement therapy, referral to a telephone quitline, and a texting program. The trial utilizes the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) and a novel mixed methods analytic design to assess clinical efficacy, cost effectiveness, and qualitative participant feedback. The primary endpoint is tobacco abstinence at 3 months, verified by participants' exhaled carbon monoxide. Results: Study enrollment began in February 2017. As of April 2017, 52 of 1056 planned participants (4.9%) were enrolled. Telephone‐based semi‐structured participant interviews and in‐person biochemical verification of smoking abstinence are completed at the 3‐month follow‐up. Efficacy and cost effectiveness analyses will be conducted after follow‐up is completed. Discussion: The goal of this study is to identify a clinically efficacious, cost‐effective intervention package for the initial treatment of tobacco dependence in ED patients. The efficacy of this combination can then be tested in a subsequent confirmatory trial. Our approach incorporates qualitative feedback from study participants in evaluating which intervention components will be tested in the future trial.

AB: Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility of a telemedicine program in an ALS center. Background: Increasing physical disability and geographic distance from centers can limit the access of ALS patients to specialized care. Telemedicine improves access, but start‐up cost and technical limitations may prevent more widespread utilization. Design/Methods: A telemedicine pilot was initiated at a single center. An existing enterprise platform (Microsoft Lync) was used. The mobile app for Lync (Skype for Business) was downloaded for free by participants. Availability of high‐speed home Internet, email and phone access and a personal device with camera were required. Patient education about the pilot and technical set‐up were developed. Workflows were created to triage telemedicine visits with patients. An encounter‐type request was submitted to the EMR and billing departments. Results: Twelve patients and three providers (physicians, nutritionist) participated in the pilot. One patient terminated participation due to technical difficulties and fatigue. Technical difficulties occurred in all other test encounters as well, but were readily resolved. Technical challenges were related to personal device set‐up, Internet connectivity at home, handling of devices, and use of video/volume controls during videoconferencing. Patients and providers reported high levels of satisfaction with the availability of telemedicine. Visits effectively addressed sensitive issues (advance directives and end of life care), but required adjustments in the process of care delivery (reading caretaker emotions off‐screen, maintaining eye contact, etc.). Conclusions: It is feasible to create a telemedicine program prototype with minimal start‐up cost. Technical and disease‐specific barriers require ongoing, rapid‐cycle adaptations. Satisfaction of participants in this pilot was high. Charge capture is essential for financial sustainability. We plan a randomized‐controlled research study to investigate the impact of telemedicine on quality of care, patient and caregiver satisfaction and cost of care.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To assess the sustainability, clinical utility and acceptability to clinicians and parents of a tele‐homecare programme for infants with major congenital heart disease (CHD), and to evaluate the impact on healthcare resource use. DESIGN: Randomised control trial. SETTING: UK tertiary congenital cardiac centre. PARTICIPANTS: 83 infants with major CHD. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomised to one of three groups: video‐conferencing support (n=35), telephone support (n=24) and a control group (n=24). Patients in the two intervention groups received regular, standardised remote consultations. Video‐conferences (VCs) were facilitated by Integrated Systems Digital Network lines and replaced by home broadband connections later in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Healthcare resource use, utilisation including hospitalisation, clinicians' opinions on utility and quality of interventions, parental opinions on quality of interventions. RESULTS: Clinicians were more confident making medical decisions following VCs compared with telephone consultations (p=0.01). Both VC and telephone support were very well received, but parents expressed significantly higher levels of satisfaction with VC support (p=0.001). Healthcare resource use was 37% lower in the video‐conferencing group compared with both telephone support and control groups (p<0.001), as was the risk of hospitalisation (p=0.006). Direct health service costs were significantly lower in the video‐conferencing group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A tele‐medicine home support programme for families of infants with major CHD is feasible, sustainable and effective. Home support with video‐conferencing is superior to telephone consultations. Parents are highly satisfied with tele‐homecare. Tele‐homecare significantly reduces health service utilisation and may reduce health service costs.

AB: BACKGROUND: Telehealth interventions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have focused primarily on stable outpatients. Telehealth designed to handle the acute exacerbation that normally requires hospitalization could also be of interest. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of home‐based telehealth hospitalization with conventional hospitalization for exacerbation in severe COPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two‐center, noninferiority, randomized, controlled effectiveness trial was conducted between June 2010 and December 2011. Patients with severe COPD admitted because of exacerbation were randomized 1:1 either to home‐based telehealth hospitalization or to continue standard treatment and care at the hospital. The primary outcome was treatment failure defined as re‐admission due to exacerbation in COPD within 30 days after initial discharge. The noninferiority margin was set at 20% of the control group's risk of re‐admission. Secondary outcomes were mortality, need for manual or mechanical ventilation or noninvasive ventilation, length of hospitalization, physiological parameters, health‐related quality of life, user satisfaction, healthcare costs, and adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 57 patients were randomized: 29 participants in the telehealth group and 28 participants in the control group. Testing the incidence of re‐admission within 30 days after discharge could not confirm noninferiority (lower 95% confidence limit [CL], ‐24.8%; p=0.35). Results were also nonsignificant at 90 days (lower 95% CL, ‐16.2%; p=0.33) and 180 days (lower 95% CL, ‐16.6%; p =0.33) after discharge. Superiority testing on secondary outcomes showed nonsignificant differences between groups. Healthcare costs have not yet been evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Whether home‐based telehealth hospitalization is noninferior to conventional hospitalization requires further investigation. The results indicate that a subgroup of patients with severe COPD can be treated for acute exacerbation at home using telehealth, without the physical presence of health professionals and with a proper organizational "back‐up."

AB: The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) is an ancillary study to the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), designed to determine the short and long‐term effects of hormone therapy on the development and progression of dementia symptoms in postmenopausal women. The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study ‐ Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes (WHIMS‐ECHO) provides annual cognitive assessments of women who were aged 65 or older at the time of randomization to WHI, and The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study of Younger Women (WHIMS‐Y) assesses the long‐term impact of random assignment to postmenopausal hormone therapy among women who were aged 50‐54 at the time of randomization into the WHI hormone trials. To increase efficiency, lower participant burden, and reduce costs, cognitive data on consenting women from WHIMS‐ECHO and WHIMS‐Y are obtained annually through centralized cognitive telephone interviews conducted by trained and certified staff at the WHIMS Coordinating Center. To assist in this process, a web‐based telephone call tracking system has been implemented, identifying administrative tasks and the order in which participants should be called based on study rules and priorities that have been established. Additionally, it is flexible enough to allow interviewers to schedule calls in accordance with participant needs. When a participant is selected, the interviewer is provided the contact information, pertinent study data and call history. After a call has been made the interviewer inputs the date, start time, end time, and outcome of the call allowing the system to track each attempt. Real‐time reports monitoring study calls are used to detect any issues that may have a significant impact on data collection, personnel needs, or costs. The poster will describe the Telephone Call Tracking System in detail discussing the benefits and challenges.

AB: Introduction: Different studies investigating telehealth care (THC) for COPD have shown conflicting results. We published a feasibility trial, which showed excellent patient adherence and satisfaction with our THC approach1. Here, we present an interim analysis of the consecutive international randomised‐controlled trial. Methods: Patients are randomly assigned to one group with a crossover after 6 months. Patients in the intervention daily answer 6 questions, focused on the early recognition of exacerbations (AECOPD), using Evita by Swisscom (extended for COPD by the study team)1. We daily analyse all entries and react according to a pre‐specified action plan. Patients in the control receive standard care without THC. In all, the COPD assessment test (CAT) is measured once weekly. Primary endpoint is HRQOL according to CAT. Results: Currently, 56 of 175 patients have completed the trial. The overall mean CAT score was 15.3 points. During the intervention, the intraindividual CAT was significantly lower than during the control (mean ‐0.6 points, p = 0.001). 23% of patients improved their CAT more than 2 points, 62% were stable and 15% worsened while being in the intervention phase. Satisfaction with COPD care (visual analogue scale) tended to be better after the intervention as compared to the control (mean 8.8 vs. 8.4 points, p = 0.46). Hospitalisation rate due to AECOPD was 0.18 per patientyear (py) during the intervention vs. 0.25 per py during the control. COPD‐related costs were 4619 CHF per py during the intervention vs. 8230 CHF per py during the control. Conclusion: After completing 32% of 175 patients, we found a discrete but significant improvement of HRQOL as measured by CAT after 6 months of our THC. Satisfaction with care was already high before the intervention and tended to increase further with THC. We found a lower hospitalisation rate during the intervention and consecutively relevantly lower total COPD‐related costs.

AB: Background: The Southeastern United States has the lowest rates of kidney transplant in the nation. Disparities in transplant access among end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients may be attributable to the initial stages of the transplant process, including transplant evaluation. Transplant center providers have yet to be surveyed about patient evaluation barriers and center practices. We aimed to identify transplant center staff perceived patient barriers to kidney transplant evaluation. Methods: We emailed a 54‐item survey to transplant coordinators and social workers at 9 transplant centers in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. We assessed staff perceived patient barriers to evaluation including the evaluation length, distance to transplant center, required medical testing, and services offered to reduce patient barriers, such as patient education and financial resources. Results: A total of 34 coordinators and social workers from 7 centers completed the survey. Staff reported that the average number of patient evaluation visits is 2.1 (range: 1, 5) and 43% of centers require patients to complete >5 medical tests prior to evaluation. When asked to identify reasons why patients may not present for evaluation, staff reported lack of transportation to the transplant center (62%), lack of understanding about the transplant process (35%), and concerns about posttransplant medication costs (24%). To relieve travel‐related concerns, some centers have satellite clinics (43%), telemedicine programs (29%), reduced parking costs (43%), and discounted overnight housing (57%) (Figur presented). Prior to evaluation, some centers require patients to complete in‐person (29%) or online (14%) transplant education sessions. None of the centers require patients to fundraise prior to evaluation and 4 centers give patients an opportunity to speak with a financial coordinator prior to evaluation start. Conclusion: Understanding transplant staff perceived barriers to evaluation may help inform center‐specific interventions to increase evaluation rates among ESRD patients, and also ensure providers are aware of their center's policies so they can be better communicated to patients.

DOI: 10.1089/tmj.2014.0098
AB: BACKGROUND: Telehealth interventions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have focused primarily on stable outpatients. Telehealth designed to handle the acute exacerbation that normally requires hospitalization could also be of interest. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of home‐based telehealth hospitalization with conventional hospitalization for exacerbation in severe COPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two‐center, noninferiority, randomized, controlled effectiveness trial was conducted between June 2010 and December 2011. Patients with severe COPD admitted because of exacerbation were randomized 1:1 either to home‐based telehealth hospitalization or to continue standard treatment and care at the hospital. The primary outcome was treatment failure defined as re‐admission due to exacerbation in COPD within 30 days after initial discharge. The noninferiority margin was set at 20% of the control group's risk of re‐admission. Secondary outcomes were mortality, need for manual or mechanical ventilation or noninvasive ventilation, length of hospitalization, physiological parameters, health‐related quality of life, user satisfaction, healthcare costs, and adverse events. RESULTS: In total, 57 patients were randomized: 29 participants in the telehealth group and 28 participants in the control group. Testing the incidence of re‐admission within 30 days after discharge could not confirm noninferiority (lower 95% confidence limit [CL], ‐24.8%; p=0.35). Results were also nonsignificant at 90 days (lower 95% CL, ‐16.2%; p=0.33) and 180 days (lower 95% CL, ‐16.6%; p =0.33) after discharge. Superiority testing on secondary outcomes showed nonsignificant differences between groups. Healthcare costs have not yet been evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Whether home‐based telehealth hospitalization is noninferior to conventional hospitalization requires further investigation. The results indicate that a subgroup of patients with severe COPD can be treated for acute exacerbation at home using telehealth, without the physical presence of health professionals and with a proper organizational "back‐up."

KY: Hip Injuries; Osteoarthritis; Osteoarthritis, Hip
AB: Osteoarthritis is the main and most common reason for replacing hip joint and in forecast for 2020s this will be the fourth reason that causes disabilities throughout the world. Osteoarthritis causes not only physical limitation but also damage to the quality of life. Pain and functional limitation appear among about 10% of men and 18% of women over the age of 60. Pain and limitation in range of movement, functional decrease in daily functioning such as walking distance and endurance, difficulty in climbing up and down stairs are typical signs among those patients before surgery and treatment. Other physical defects following hip replacement surgery last for over a year and they include a decrease in muscle strength round the operated hip, a defect in keeping balance in the operated leg and a functional decrease that includes decrease in walking speed, damage in the ability of climbing up and down stairs and difficulty in standing up. Physical rehabilitation has importance among patients after hip joint surgery. Rehabilitation begins on the first stage at the rehabilitation hospital and continues after discharge at the community, at home or at the clinic. Often, the need for a continuing rehabilitation treatment after discharge exceeds the treatment provided actually by healthcare in Israel because of various reasons e.g. residence in remote areas, loads of patients who need treatment and high costs of manpower and reaching the treatments. Remote Therapy is an alternative means to the present therapy in clinics which is provided at the patient's home and thus solving these problems. Remote Therapy employs technological communication and thus enables the patient to continue the rehabilitation process independently with no need for reaching the clinic which makes it easier for the patient and saves economic costs for the financial agent. The purpose of the present study is to examine whether an intervention plan based on exercise through remote rehabilitation system leads to improvement in characteristics of walking and balance among patients after hip replacement surgery compared to the current conventional way of exercise among these patients

AB: Rationale: Early detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseas (COPD) exacerbations using telemonitoring of physiological variables might reduce the frequency of hospitalization. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of home monitoring of lung mechanics by the forced oscillation technique and cardiac parameter in older patients with COPD and comorbidities. Methods: This multicenter, randomized clinical trial recruited 312 patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease grades II to IV COPD (median age, 71 yr [interquartile range 66‐76 yr]; 49.6% grade II, 50.4% grades III‐IV), with a history of exacerbation in the previous year and at least one nonpulmonary comorbidity. Patients were randomized to usual care (n = 158) or telemonitoring (n = 154) and followed for 9 months. All telemonitoring patients self‐assessed lung mechanics daily, and in a subgroup with congestive heart failure (n = 37) cardiac parameters were also monitored. An algorithm identified deterioration, triggering a telephone contact to determine appropriate interventions. Measurements and Main Results: Primary outcomes were time to first hospitalization (TTFH) and change in the EuroQoL EQ‐5D utility index score. Secondary outcomes included: rate of antibiotic/corticosteroid prescription; hospitalization; the COPD Assessment Tool, Patient Health Questionnaire‐9, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire scores; quality‐adjusted life years; and healthcare costs. Telemonitoring did not affect TTFH, EQ‐5D utility index score, antibiotic prescriptions, hospitalization rate, or questionnaire scores. In an exploratory analysis, telemedicine was associated with fewer repeat hospitalizations (254%; P = 0.017). Conclusions: In older patients with COPD and comorbidities, remote monitoring of lung function by forced oscillation technique and cardiac parameters did not change TTFH and EQ‐5D.

KY: Apnea; Sleep Apnea Syndromes
AB: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is estimated to be the third most common chronic disease in Veterans and is associated with an increased risk of hypertension, heart attacks, strokes, depression, and driving accidents. Current in‐person management at a sleep center limits Veterans' access to care, prolongs patient wait times, and requires Veterans living in remote areas to travel long distances. This proposal will evaluate an innovative web‐based clinical pathway to diagnose and manage Veterans with OSA. In FY13, the investigative team received a VHA Innovation Award to create the Remote Veteran Apnea Management Portal (REVAMP), a personalized, interactive website that, when combined with other emerging telehealth technologies, is designed to improve access to care, reduce patient wait times, and allow Veterans to receive care without travelling to a sleep center. Veterans complete intake and follow‐up questionnaires on the REVAMP website and perform an unattended home sleep test (HST) without in‐person instructions. Sleep specialists review the findings with the patient during an initial phone clinic. REVAMP auto‐populates the Veteran's questionnaire responses into templated progress notes that are exported to CPRS, the electronic medical record. Veterans diagnosed with OSA are treated with automatically adjusting positive airway pressure (APAP) units. These devices transmit data wirelessly to the website where treatment use and its effectiveness can be monitored by both Veterans and practitioners, thereby promoting patient self‐management and productive patient‐practitioner interactions. The investigators' proposed prospective, randomized intervention will compare the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of REVAMP management of Veterans with OSA to in‐person care. Aim 1 will determine if management with REVAMP is clinically non‐inferior to in‐person care in terms of improvement in functional outcomes and APAP adherence. Non‐inferiority of clinical effectiveness following 3 months of APAP treatment will be expressed in terms of improvement in the score of the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ‐10), the investigators' primary outcome measure. Adherence to APAP will be objectively monitored by wireless transmission of data from the participant's home unit. In Aim 2, patient preference, medical service use and cost will be collected every 3 months for the entire observation period to compare cost effectiveness of the two managements. Preference will be assessed by the SF‐6D,6 and the EQ‐5D.7, 8 Differences in the ratio of cost and quality‐adjusted life years saved by REVAMP compared to in‐person management will test the hypothesis that REVAMP management will have lower cost and equivalent outcomes. The results of Aims 1 and 2 will provide evidence to support widespread dissemination of REVAMP. Formative evaluation in Aim 3 will use qualitative (targeted phone interviews) and quantitative measures (attrition, work alliance, and patient satisfaction) to inform clinicians, administrators and other stakeholders how to implement this innovative chronic disease pathway. Aim 1 (primary). To compare functional outcomes following 3 months of APAP treatment in Veterans with OSA randomized to REVAMP versus in‐person management. The primary outcome measure in this modified intent‐to‐treat analysis (i.e., subjects initiated on APAP with at least one FOSQ follow‐up score) will be the change from baseline in the FOSQ‐10 score. Analysis will also compare the mean daily hours of APAP use in participants in the two groups initiated on APAP treatment. Hypothesis 1a: Mean change in FOSQ‐10 score among participants randomized to REVAMP management will be no more than one point less than that in participants receiving in‐person management. Hypothesis 1b: Mean daily hours of APAP use among participants receiving REVAMP management will be no more than 0.75 hour less than that in participants randomized to in‐person management. Aim 2 (secondary): To compare the differences in cost and quality‐adjusted life years (QALY) between REVAMP management and in‐person management. The perspective of the analysis will be that of the VA and the intention to treat analysis set will include all randomized participants. Hypothesis 2a: Average total health‐care delivery cost will be lower for participants receiving REVAMP compared to in‐person management. Hypothesis 2b: The 90% lower limit of cost per QALY ratio comparing in‐person versus REVAMP manage‐ment will be > $100,000 (i.e., the investigators will have 90% confidence that REVAMP is good value for the cost). Aim 3 (exploratory): To conduct a mixed methods formative evaluation that will guide REVAMP's widespread implementation. Quantitative component: The investigators will track quantitative outcome measures across both groups including attrition, participant‐ and practitioner‐rated therapeutic alliance (Working Alliance Inventory‐Short Revised [WAI‐SR]),9 and participant treatment satisfaction (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire [CSQ‐8]).10 The investigators will compare the scores of the WAI‐SR and CSQ‐8 and attrition rates between treatment arms. Qualitative component: The investigators will explore participant‐ and practitioner‐level perspectives, attitudes, and preferences regarding REVAMP versus in‐person management, as well as barriers and facilitators to participation in either clinical pathway through phone interviews with participants from the two intervention groups, participants who withdraw from either intervention, and staff who provide care through REVAMP.

AB: Recent studies have demonstrated the promising potential that telehealth has in management of chronic disease. For COPD patients, implementation of telehealth reduced readmissions, emergency room visits, and exacerbations and was cost‐effective. Telehealth as a method of delivering healthcare to remote, resource‐deprived areas is not lacking in evidence of benefit; however, the situation about its more widespread use for monitoring purposes is much less clear. To date, most of the studies dealing with telehealth in COPD were conducted in countries covering vast territories. Therefore, it needs to be investigated whether telehealth conveys similar advantages for COPD patients in a small island country.

AB: BACKGROUND: Nowadays, social media tools such as short message service, Twitter, video, and web‐based systems are more and more used in clinical follow‐up, making clinical follow‐up much more time‐ and cost‐effective than ever before. However, as the most popular social media in China, little is known about the utility of smartphone WeChat application in follow‐up. In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and superiority of WeChat application in clinical follow‐up. METHODS: A total of 108 patients diagnosed with head and neck tumor were randomized to WeChat follow‐up (WFU) group or telephone follow‐up (TFU) group for 6‐month follow‐up. The follow‐ups were delivered by WeChat or telephone at 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3, and 6 months to the patients after being discharged. The study measurements were time consumption for follow‐up delivery, total economic cost, lost‐to‐follow‐up rate, and overall satisfaction for the follow‐up method. RESULTS: Time consumption in WFU group for each patient (23.36 ± 6.16 min) was significantly shorter than that in TFU group (42.89 ± 7.15 min) (P < 0.001); total economic cost in WFU group (RMB 90 Yuan) was much lower than that in TFU group (RMB 196 Yuan). Lost‐to‐follow‐up rate in the WFU group was 7.02% (4/57) compared with TFU group, 9.80% (5/51), while no significance was observed (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.176‐2.740; P = 0.732). The overall satisfaction rate in WFU group was 94.34% (50/53) compared with 80.43% (37/46) in TFU group (95% CI: 0.057‐0.067; P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: The smartphone WeChat application was found to be a viable option for follow‐up in discharged patients with head and neck tumors. WFU was time‐effective, cost‐effective, and convenient in communication. This doctor‐led follow‐up model has the potential to establish a good physician‐patient relationship by enhancing dynamic communications and providing individual health instructions.

AB: BACKGROUND: Fear of Cancer Recurrence (FCR) is a normal and common concern for most cancer survivors. For 9‐34% fear becomes a chronic problem. Few studies investigated interventions specifically designed for clinical levels of FCR. We developed and assessed an intervention based on the theoretical model by Lee‐Jones (1997), which hypothesizes that an emotional reaction (FCR) can be the result of interpretations of the threat of cancer, triggered by perceptions of internal and/or external cues. METHOD: In a two‐arm randomized controlled trial, among breast, prostate and colorectal cancer survivors, the efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of blended care will be compared to treatment as usual in managing FCR and thereby reducing related functional and psychological consequences. The intervention is based on principles of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and is directed at change of the cognitions and behaviors managing FCR. It is designed as blended care, combining face‐to‐face CBT with online activities. Primary and secondary outcome measures are severity of FCR, quality of life and cost‐effectiveness. Moderators and mediators of treatment effects will be determined as well. RESULTS: The intervention will consist of six to eight CBT sessions over a three‐month period. Key factors of FCR will be determined for each patient and the intervention will be tailored to a patient's needs. The first five sessions will be face‐to‐face communication with a therapist, in the last sessions (six‐eight) shared decision‐ making will take place on how to continue therapy: face‐to‐face or via the interactive website (web‐based CBT with psycho‐education, assignments and email contact). The development of the intervention was secured by patient participation, a multidisciplinary reading committee and a small pilot study. CONCLUSIONS: The SWORD study tackles FCR with one of the most frequently used psychotherapeutic interventions nowadays (CBT) and complements this with the latest developments in the field of E‐health. At this moment, the (cost‐) effectiveness of the intervention is evaluated in a randomized controlled trial carried out in the Netherlands. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: To guide the next generation of studies (and to inform clinical applications) the proposed study also includes information on moderators and mediators of treatment effects. This will help to increase our understanding of the nature of FCR. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: With the current study an appropriate evidence‐based and cost‐effective intervention to treat FCR can become available. Hereby, the SWORD study will improve quality of life and quality of care in breast, colorectal and prostate cancer survivors and contributes to an optimal adjustment to a severe disease like cancer. In the future, evidence‐based results of the proposed study can be used to manage high levels of FCR in patients with other cancer diagnoses.

AB: BACKGROUND: Despite the efforts of the healthcare community to improve the quality of diabetes care, about 50% of people with type 2 diabetes do not reach their treatment targets, increasing the risk of future micro‐and macro‐vascular complications. Diabetes self‐management education has been shown to contribute to better disease control. However, it is not known which strategies involving educational programs are cost‐effective. Telehealth applications might support chronic disease management. Transferability of successful distant patient self‐management support programs to the Belgian setting needs to be confirmed by studies of a high methodological quality. "The COACH Program" was developed in Australia as target driven educational telephone delivered intervention to support people with different chronic conditions. It proved to be effective in patients with coronary heart disease after hospitalization. Clinical and cost‐effectiveness of The COACH Program in people with type 2 diabetes in Belgium needs to be assessed. METHODS/DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients were selected based on their medication consumption data and were recruited by their sickness fund. They were randomized to receive either usual care plus "The COACH Program" or usual care alone. The study will assess the difference in outcomes between groups. The primary outcome measure is the level of HbA1c. The secondary outcomes are: Total Cholesterol, LDL‐Cholesterol, HDL‐Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Blood Pressure, body mass index, smoking status; proportion of people at target for HbA1c, LDL‐Cholesterol and Blood Pressure; self‐perceived health status, diabetes‐specific emotional distress and satisfaction with diabetes care. The follow‐up period is 18 months. Within‐trial and modeled cost‐utility analyses, to project effects over life‐time horizon beyond the trial duration, will be undertaken from the perspective of the health care system if the intervention is effective. DISCUSSION: The study will enhance our understanding of the potential of telehealth in diabetes management in Belgium. Research on the clinical effectiveness and the cost‐effectiveness is essential to support policy makers in future reimbursement and implementation decisions.

AB: The purpose of this study was to measure the ability of telemonitoring to reduce hospital days and total costs for Medicare managed care enrollees diagnosed with heart failure. Patients were recruited and randomly assigned for six months to either telemonitoring or standard care. Telemonitoring transmitted vital signs and clinical alerts daily to a central nursing station. Utilization of covered services was analyzed for the six‐month telemonitoring period to test for hypothesized reductions in hospital days and changes in utilization of the emergency department (ED), urgent care, and primary care. Negative binomial regressions adjusted for gender, age, co‐occurring diabetes, co‐occurring chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and residence neighborhood were used to analyze units of service, and two‐part (hurdle) multivariable models were used for expenditures. The main finding was a tendency for lower total number of hospital days for patients assigned to telemonitoring. Results for other covered services were generally consistent with hypothesized direction and magnitude; however, statistical power was reduced because of lower‐than‐expected recruitment rates into the study. Within a managed‐care environment, telemonitoring appears to facilitate better ambulatory management of heart failure patients, including fewer ED visits, which were offset by more frequent primary care and urgent care visits.

AB: The research design is a randomized waitlist control trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to the immediate intervention group or 4‐month waitlist control group. The former will immediately join the tablet computer courses, while the later will wait for four (4) months before starting their courses. The follow‐up period for patients will be one (1) year after the start of courses. Patient assessments will include baseline and follow‐up assessments of health behaviors, functional status, health conditions, and social interactions and engagements, plus technology use and acceptance. Baseline assessment will be conducted at recruitment for all patients, and for waitlist control group again at the beginning of the course. Follow‐up assessments will be conducted at four (4) months, eight (8) months, and twelve (12) months after the start date of the courses. Young volunteers will also be assessed to understand their experiences in the volunteering services and any impact from this experience. The assessments will be conducted at the baseline, during the courses, and two (2) months and four (4) months after the beginning of the courses. In addition, a group of 140 young adults will be recruited from universities to serve as the comparison group and will be asked to complete the assessment survey at baseline, two (2) months, and four (4) months later. For older adults: Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be referred by doctors in the metabolism and endocrinology department of the two hospitals to recruiters and will be randomly assigned to immediate intervention group and waitlist control group. The aim of the comparison is to assess the potential effects of mobile technology program with intergenerational interaction on patients' technology use, self‐efficacy, self‐management behavior, and social engagement, and whether it results in less social isolation and health care utilization, improved health and mental health status, and greater quality of life. Recruitment procedure: 1. Tzu Chi diabetes health educators will recruit patients with type 2 diabetes and screen them for eligibility. They will complete a patient contact card for each patient that they screen for eligibility. If eligible, the health educators will explain the study to the patients and ask for their interest to participate. They will then refer interested patients to an IMTOP study recruiter. They will also pass all patient contact cards and completed screeners to an IMTOP study recruiter. 2. The study recruiters on site in the hospital will obtain the informed consent from the eligible and interested patients. When the patients sign the study consent, the recruiter will write on the patient contact card the patient ID next to Study Participation Status ‐ Enrolled, and complete the patient contact card. 3. The recruiter will then conduct the baseline interview. Baseline interview can be done face to face or via telephone if patient prefers. 4. Patient's study group (immediate intervention or wait list control group) will be randomly assigned at qualtrics database after baseline interview is complete. 5. All recruitment paper, if any, will send to the project manager to file on a locked cabinet. 6. The patients who are randomized to the immediate intervention group will be assigned to the training course as soon as a course is available. The patients randomized to the waitlist control group will need to wait for six months to serve as no intervention control, and then assigned to the training course. Description of intervention: The intervention is a 12‐week program which consists of 8‐week training sessions followed by 4‐week consultation service for technical support. Both will be provided by the young volunteers. The themes of the 8‐week training session are designed based on the objectives of IMTOP: 1) teach skills of tablet use, 2) introduce online community communication to decrease social isolation and obtain social support from family and friends, young volunteers, health care providers, and diabetes peers who have similar condition/interest/ or disease), 3) teach diabetes self‐management knowledge and skills based on the evidence‐based Chronic Disease Self‐Management Program; and 4) teach mobile technology application to healthcare access and daily needs (i.e., online appointment, online refill, appointment reminder, online health information, online training videos, and virtual classes such as e‐newspaper, e‐books, related sites, apps). Moreover, the enrolled older adults will be invited to use a diabetes self‐management behavior tracking app developed by the research team. The app is designed to encourage diabetes patients to regularly record their diet, physical activity, water consumption, medication adherence, blood sugar readings, and blood pressure readings. The data will be used for our research analysis to understand to what extent the older adults use the app and whether regular recording has impact on the outcome measures. The 4‐week consultation service post the 8‐week training course is intended as additional support for the older adults who encounter technical issues when using the tablet on their own. To receive the technical support, the older adults shall call the study hotline or post their questions on the study website to explain the technical issues. The research staff will find a study volunteer to address the technical issues. During the training sessions in the classroom, the research team may audiotape, videotape, or take photos to record classroom interactions between older adults and young volunteers. The recordings will be no more than half of the 8 sessions and each time we may videotape up to 90‐min per session. The purposes are for quality improvement of the IMTOP program, for research analyses at the aggregate level, and for dissemination of the program. The participants have the rights to decide whether to be taped or photographed. They may indicate their decision on the consent form or by telling the recorder/photographer at the time of the taping/photo shooting. Accrual and baseline data collection: University of Southern California (USC) research team will prepare enrollment packages (including an information sheet, the screener, the patient contact card, the consent form, HIPPA form and a 40‐minute baseline survey). Health educators employed by two Tzu Chi Hospitals will help enroll and consent eligible patients. Participating patients will be asked to sign the HIPPA authorization form to release their medical records in hospitals. Consenting patients will be invited to take baseline survey through an interview with a study interviewer, either in‐person or by phone based on patient's preference. When baseline survey is completed, patients will be randomly assigned to intervention group and wait‐list control group. Follow‐up survey: For immediate intervention patients, 4‐month, 8‐month, and 12‐month follow‐up surveys will be administered via telephone by part‐time interviewers employed for the study by the hospitals. For wait‐list control group patients, 4‐month, 8‐month, 12‐month, and 16‐month follow‐up surveys will be administered via telephone by the part‐time interviewers. Study data will be obtained from patients' self‐report on study assessments, study tracking records such as the training course attendance, and patients' medical records pertaining to diabetes care and healthcare utilizations in Taipei and Hualien Tzu Chi Hospitals. Self‐report data collected from patients include demographic characteristics, physical health and mental health status, self‐management behaviors, health care utilization, health literacy, self‐efficacy, social engagement, and quality of life. The study assessments and study tracking records will be conducted exclusively for research purposes. For young volunteers: Accrual and baseline data collection: IMTOP research staff and employees (such as diabetes health educators) of the Taipei and Hualien Tzu Chi Hospitals will distribute young volunteer recruitment flyers to officer of student affairs and faculty at various universities nearby the study sties. The IMTOP research staff will also arrange meetings at university campuses to introduce the study and call for volunteers. The study information and the call for volunteers will be disseminated campus wide two months prior to each IMTOP training term starts. Young adults who are interested in participating in the study as volunteer instructors for the training course will sign up at the study website IMTOP.usc.edu. The sign‐up section of the website will explicitly show the language that enrollment in the study means a volunteer is not only serving as an instructor but also as a research participant. To complete the sign up will require acknowledgment of the dual roles. There will be a study hotline number shown on the recruitment flyer for interested young adults to get more information about the study and for sign‐up. The research staff will contact those young adults who meet the study inclusion criteria for an interview to clarify the job responsibilities and the expectations. Those who agree to meet the expectations will be invited to attend the two‐day training workshop (described below). On the day of the training workshop, the young adults will be asked to consent for their study participation and to complete the study baseline. Then they will be accepted for the study enrollment as young volunteers. The target recruitment is 140 volunteers. USC research team will prepare the enrollment package (including the recruitment flyer, the sign‐up form, the consent form, and a 40‐minute self‐administered baseline survey). The sign‐up and the consent form will be available via the study website IMTOP.usc.edu. The self‐administered surveys will be available on qualtrics website via a web link in the study website. Orientation workshop: USC research team will provide two orientation workshops for enrolled volunteers to learn skills and knowledge for delivering the intervention service. The topics of orientation workshops include young volunteers' role and responsibilities in the IMTOP research project, knowledge of aging process, motivational interviewing skills, problem solving skills, empathy, communication with older adults, and introduction of the 8‐week training curriculum and the 4‐week technical support. Volunteering services: After the orientation workshop is successfully completed, young volunteers will be assigned to be one of about 4 instructing volunteers to provide the tablet training for a group of approximately 10 older adults with type 2 diabetes. The training course is 2 hours per session and 1 session per week for 8 weeks long. In each session, there is a prepared course material for the volunteers to deliver to the older adults, such as use of web browsers, application of social media, and online supporting materials for the older adults to learn mobile technology for their self‐management to improve health and quality of life. After the 8‐week training period, the young volunteers will provide 4‐week technical support for the diabetes outpatients via phone or mobile device. During the tablet training sessions in the classroom, the research team may audiotape, videotape, or take photos to record classroom interactions between older adults and young volunteers. The recordings will be no more than half of the 8 sessions and each time we may videotape up to 120‐min per session. The purposes are for quality improvement of the IMTOP program, for research analyses at the aggregate level, and for dissemination of the program. The participants have the rights to decide whether to be taped or photographed. They may indicate their decision on the consent form or by telling the recorder/photographer at the time of the taping/photo shooting. Baseline and follow‐up survey: The enrolled young volunteers will be asked to complete the self‐administered online surveys at baseline and at 2‐month and 4‐month follow up. That is, the baseline will be completed prior to the intervention. The 2‐month follow‐up will be completed immediately after the 8‐week training course. The 4‐month follow‐up will be completed one month after the 4‐week technical support period. The survey will collect data about demographic characteristics, level of empathy, citizenship behavior, time management skills, altruism value, purpose of life, and career development. In addition, the young volunteers will be asked to take turn in recording the class log, including the class attendance, materials taught, Q&A, any difficulty or questions in delivering the curriculum, and other relevant observations or issues. Additionally, once a month for a total of three times, once in week 4 and once in week 8 during the 8‐week course, plus once in the end of the 4‐week technical support, they will be asked to write a short reflection of their volunteering experience. These study assessments and study tracking records will be conducted exclusively for research purposes. For young adult comparison group: A group of 140 young adults similar to the young volunteers will be recruited from universities through information meetings held by the research staff in collaboration with officer of student affairs and faculty at various universities. They will not be randomized, but instead they will be deliberately recruited to be the comparison group that matches with the young volunteer group on the bases of age range, college attendance and major, and location of the schools. These young adults will be informed to serve as the comparison group for the study. Once consented, they will be directed to answer the same self‐administered online surveys at baseline and at 2‐month and 4‐month follow up. Data Storage and Confidentiality: 1. All questionnaires completed electronically via the web‐based survey company qualtrics, license available through the USC Information Technology Services (http://www.usc.edu/its/qualtrics/), will be kept in the secure website of qualtrics and then downloaded into a centralized database located in the USC School of Social Work. The following links show privacy, acceptable use, and security statements provided by qualtrics: http://www.qualtrics.com/privacy‐statement/ http://www.qualtrics.com/acceptable‐use‐statement/ http://www.qualtrics.com/security‐statement/ 2. Data collected on the study website IMTOP.usc.edu will be stored in secure and password protected website at Amazon Cloud Drive, and then downloaded into a centralized database located in the USC School of Social Work. 3. A password protected secure computer file linking identifying information and the subject study ID will be securely maintained under control of Dr. Wu and the study Data Analyst in the School of Social Work. 4. All study data files will only contain subject IDs, not identifying information. 5. Analysis and publication of the data will employ procedures making it impossible to identify individuals. 6. After completion of the study, identifiable data such as video tapes will be destroyed, but the remaining data will be retained at the researchers discretion and may be used in future research studies. .. 7. All study investigators and staff have already or will complete the USC IRB and required HIPAA certification course. Hardcopy study data will be kept in the secure location in the USC School of Social Work or in a designated locked cabinet in the collaborating Tzu Chi hospitals for a period of 5 years following study completion, after which it will be destroyed. Study tracking data will also be kept on a secure, password protected, web‐site maintained by the School of Social Work within the Hamovitch Research Center. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT Potential Risks: There are no anticipated risks to subjects' participation in this study. The tablet training program takes place in Taipei or Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital. Subjects' participation in the program may involve normal risks in transportation to attend the training sessions. Frequency and intensity of training sessions might cause them certain level of anxiety and discomfort, such as soreness in eye. As the study subjects will also participate in the study surveys, some of the survey questions may make them uncomfortable or concerned, but they can choose not to answer any questions they do not wish to answer. Participating in research may involve a loss of privacy, but all of the information the subjects provide will be kept confidential. The possibility of a breach of privacy to occur is very low but will exist as long as we hold the data. All participants will be advised that they are free not to use the technology and not to answer any questions that make them uncomfortable. However, in previous studies of depressed patients, distress resulting from interviews and questionnaires has been minimal. Subjects may experience inconvenience and time costs associated with using technology and completing study interviews; however, all interventions and interviews are completely voluntary and will be conducted at the participant' convenience. The technology intervention does not expose patients to additional or unusual medications or side effects. Although all efforts will be made to protect patient confidentiality, those patients who experience critical clinical events (e.g., hypoglycemia) during the study training sessions or those who are likely victims of abuse may experience loss of confidentiality as study staff will be required to report these events to the subject's physician for appropriate safety measures to be taken. Risk Classification: The risks of this study are consistent with the HHS/FDA Regulations definition of minimal risk. Protection Against Risks: The study PIs and the project manger who has a gerontology and public health background will train the study recruiters, interviewers, and young volunteers to handle distressed or potentially at risk patients during recruitment, intervention, and assessment. The recruiters, interviewers, and young volunteers will request permission from distressed subjects to notify their physician so that they may be assessed and treated as necessary. In the case of emergengy, the recruiters, interviewers, and young volunteers will inform the patient of the immediate need to notify the patient's physician, even without his or her permission, so that these providers may take appropriate action to ensure patient safety. This will involve using usual clinic channels to have the patient urgently evaluated and and appropriate disposition arranged (including possible transport to Emergency Department in Taipei and Hualien Tzu Chi Hospitals). The study principal investigator in the local site will be available by cellular phone and will also be notified of emergency patients in order to to ensure timely assessment and treatment by a physician. Data Safety Monitoring Plan: All assessment data will be entered into a centralized database located in the USC School of Social Work. Study patients will be identified by a unique study code number, the identity of which will be known only to the study personnel with direct responsibility for providing patient data. The database will be password protected against non‐project personnel and backed up weekly. This removes patient‐identifiable data from the files. The data manager and biostatistician will create a series of databases in Excel and SAS, so that they can analyze the initial data as it comes in to ensure proper patient recruitment, track progress of the study, and perform data checks and cleaning. All baseline and follow‐up data, including responses to the screener questionnaire, will be entered on qualtrics web‐based survey system through tablets or other computer devices onsite. The data will be identified by the patient's study ID code. This data will be transmitted either wirelessly, through third or forth generation mobile telecommunications, or through the local network connection in real time to the qualtrics server as data is entered by recruiters on the computer devices, which has been loaded with the requisite software and encryption system. The transmitted data will be encrypted using HIPAA‐compliant encryption and password protected. If there is poor wireless connection or mobile telecommunication transmission is not possible, recruiters will enter baseline and follow‐up data on paper forms. All forms will be checked for completeness by the qualtric systems or, if paper, by the study coordinator before being sent to the project manager. The project manager will review and double‐check all of the forms to be sure they are completed and readable. For data on paper forms, data will be entered singly using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., SAS Campus Drive, Cary, NC) full screen editor (FSEDIT) into SAS database system with back‐up copy and hard copy kept in secure locked file cabinet in the SSW. For data on the qualtrics server, data would be downloaded onto local sites into the SAS database system with back‐up copy password‐protected. Accuracy of data entry will be ensured by an internal program with FSEDIT for range and logic check, and by a comparison between printouts and the handwritten data forms. To assist in monitoring the study, periodic reports will be generated using graphs and tables summarizing the status of subject recruitment and data collection. Missing data will be routinely rectified. SAS will also be used to analyze the data and generate all statistical reports. Data on the qualtrics server and the project website will be destroyed at the end of the study. Potential Benefits to the Subject and/or Society: Direct benefits to patients who participate IMTOP study include learning: 1) skills of tablet use, 2) online community communication with family and friends, young volunteers, health care providers, and diabetes peers who have similar condition/interest/ or disease, 3) diabetes self‐management knowledge and skills; and 4) mobile technology application to health access and daily needs (i.e., online appointment, online refill, appointment reminder, online health information, online training videos, and virtual classes such as e‐newspaper, e‐books, related sites, apps) at no or minimal out‐of‐pocket cost (e.g., transportation cost to attend the training course). There is a potential of improving the flow of communication between these patients and their health educators as well as physicians through using mobile technology. Self‐management knowledge and behaviors will improve among them. Those patients in the waitlist control group may also experience benefits due to the raised levels of awareness of self‐management, and later experience the potential benefits associated with the tablet training intervention. The potential benefit to society is that IMTOP intervention is likely to create an approach to improve self‐management behaviors, health outcomes, and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, with improvement in self‐monitoring behavior among older diabetes patients and raised levels of health awareness among young volunteers, medical expenses of diabetes care by the government might decrease, which benefits the society as a whole. Alternatives to Participation: Refusal to participate will not negatively impact older adults' diabetes care or their access to usually available health services. If patients are interested in learning more about diabetes self‐management skills, but do not wish to participate in the study, written educational materials in Chinese will be available. Refusal to participate among young adults, either in the volunteering group or in the comparison group, also will not have any negative impact on the younger adults. They can request to receive a copy of written educational materials in Chinese for future diabetes prevention. Risk/Benefit Relationship: The potential benefits to participants are greater than the risks associated with participation. The physical, psychological, social, and legal risks to patients with type 2 diabetes are minimal. IMTOP study aims to improve their health outcomes and quality of life. In addition, the intergenerational interactions could be a motivator for them to learn the technology to enhance their skills of self‐management, which may result in improved health and decreased cost of medical care as a whole. For young volunteers, the risk is negligible but the focus of intergenerational interactions could potentially improve their communication with and empathy for older adults, increase awareness of self‐care and disease prevention, build health‐focused values of life style, and shape future career choice. For young adults in the comparison group, although both risk and benefit are minimal, they may feel a sense of pride through their contribution to research.

KY: Kidney Diseases; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic
AB: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue. Approximately, 11% of the US population has CKD with an increased prevalence among individuals great than 65years. Many individuals with CKD go unrecognized because they are typically asymptomatic. Individuals with CKD have been demonstrated to have a greater risk for mortality, hospitalization and development of end stage kidney disease. Also, individuals with CKD consume a significantly greater proportion of health care expenditures compared to other patients. This study aims to determine if the adoption of a chronic care model in conjunction with telemonitoring and case management can reduce risk of death, hospitalization, ER visits or admission to a skilled nursing facility in patients with CKD compared to usual care. This study will use a randomized controlled trial. Few interventions have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes in patients with CKD. If successful, this study will enable the VA to provide high quality care to patients with CKD while potentially reducing the cost of providing care.

AB: Rationale: The treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation is often inadequate due to poor guideline adherence. An integrated chronic care program (ICCP) at a specialized AF‐clinic was found to be superior to usual care provided by a cardiologist in terms of cardiovascular hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality. Hypothesis: treatment at a specialized AF clinic is superior to usual care in terms of cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations, cost‐effectiveness, quality of life and guideline adherence. Objectives: primary objective is to show that an ICCP reduces cardiovascular hospitalizations and mortality. The secondary objectives include cost‐effectiveness, guideline adherence, quality of life, patient knowledge and patient compliance in medication. Study design: randomized controlled trial with two study arms: usual care provided by cardiologists (control) versus integrated chronic care program at a specialized AF clinic (intervention) in 8 hospitals in the Netherlands. The RACE4 is an event driven study. A total number of 246 events is needed. In total 1716 patients with newly diagnosed AF will be included. Total duration of the study is 6 years with a minimal follow up of 1 year and maximum of 6 years. Data collected at inclusion, after 3, 6, 12 months and every year thereafter. Study population: Patients older than 18 year with newly diagnosed AF. Intervention: treatment through an ICCP at specialized AF clinics, consisting of a nurse specialist, cardiologist‐supervisor and a guidelines‐based information‐communication technology (ICT) decision support program and a web‐based patient centered medication management tool and tailored telemonitoring.

AB: Hypothesis / aims of study Individualised pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) for women with pelvic organ prolapse is offered by many physiotherapists, yet clear evidence of its long‐term clinical and cost‐effectiveness is lacking. A recent trial (1) of 109 women with prolapse (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) found benefits immediately post‐treatment from an intensive 6 month programme of PFMT (weekly appoin™ents for 3 months, followed by biweekly appoin™ents for 3 months), in terms of prolapse severity (ultrasound and pOP‐Q) and symptoms. However, evidence for a PFMT intervention targeting symptomatic women, with fewer supervised sessions which is deliverable within existing national health services is still required. The aim of this trial was to determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of such a PFMT programme. Study design, materials and methods This was a parallel group, multicentre randomised controlled trial. Women in the intervention group were randomised to PFMT, delivered by a physiotherapist at 5 appoinents over 16 weeks, and lifestyle advice. Women in the control group received a Lifestyle Advice Sheet by post only. Randomisation was by computer allocation using a remote randomisation service. Minimisation variables were: centre, POP‐Q stage and motivation for surgery (not considering/considering POP surgery). Women had their prolapse assessed by a gynaecologist (POP‐Q system) at baseline and (blinded) 6 months, and completed postal questionnaires at baseline (prior to randomisation) and 6 and 12 months. A 24 month follow‐up is underway. The primary outcome was prolapse symptom severity (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Symptom Score‐POP‐SS) (2) at 12 months. Other key outcomes were prolapse severity (POP‐Q), women's perceived change in prolapse, uptake of further treatment and cost‐effectiveness. Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat. Sample size calculations indicated that 253 per group would provide 80% power at the 5% level of significance to detect a different of 2.5 points (SD 8) in the primary outcome measure. Results 448 new gynaecology outpatients with symptomatic prolapse of POP‐Q stage I, II or III were recruited over 30 months from 23 UK centres and 2 international centres (1 women withdrew after randomisation and requested her data not be used: n=447). A further 3 international trial centres, where additional outcomes are being measured, are following up 170 women who will contribute data to a future meta‐analysis. The mean age of participants was 56.8 years (SD 11.5); median number of births was 2; 89% of all births were normal vaginal deliveries and 3% caesarean sections. The most common prolapse type was anterior prolapse (34%), followed by combined anterior/posterior prolapse (24%) and posterior prolapse alone (16%). Stage II prolapse was most common (74%), followed by stage III (15%) and stage I (11%). The mean duration of prolapse symptoms was 25.2 months (SD 40.2). The trial group characteristics were well‐balanced at baseline. Questionnaire response rates were high at 6 month follow‐up (84% intervention; 86% control), but lower at 12 months (67% intervention; 65% control). Rates of attendance for 6‐month prolapse assessment and POP‐Q were good (81% intervention; 82% control). Compliance with the intervention was high: 80% of women attended 4 or 5 physiotherapy sessions. Prolapse symptoms: The POP‐SS was significantly lower (fewer, less frequent symptoms) in the intervention group compared to the control group at 6 months (estimate of difference between groups in change from baseline 2.84, 95% CI [2.05, 3.63], p < 0.001) and 12 months (estimate 1.52, 95% CI [0.46, 2.59], p=0.005) (Table 1). The most common single symptom reported at baseline was “a feeling of something coming down” (85.8% intervention/87.8% control reported having this symptom at least occasionally); this persisted as the most common symptom at 6 months (72.0% intervention/84.4% control) and 12 months (65.3% intervention/70.8% control). (Table presented) Prolapse severity: Change in prolapse stage from baseline to 6‐month follow‐up showed a marginally significant difference between trial groups (Mann Whitney test p=0.052): 20% in the intervention group had an improved stage versus 12% in the control group. The majority of women in both groups had no change in their prolapse stage (Table 2). (Table presented) Uptake of further treatment: By 12 months, a significantly greater proportion of control women (55%) reported they had received further treatment for prolapse compared to the intervention women (30%) (difference estimate 25%, p < 0.001). Control women were significantly more likely than intervention women to report referral to physiotherapy. Rates for receiving other treatments were similar. Self‐reported change: Intervention group women were significantly more likely than control group women to report their prolapse felt better compared to the start of the study, both at 6 months (52% intervention vs 17% control) (p < 0.001) and 12 months (57% vs 45%) (p=0.012). Pelvic floor muscle function: In the intervention group (n=143, those who attended the 5th appoin™ent), there was a significant increase in contraction strength from baseline on the modified Oxford scale (mean increase 0.6, 95% Cl [0.5, 0.7], p < 0.001). Cost‐effectiveness: The net cost of the intervention, taking into account the cost of further treatment received/avoided, was £127 per woman. This cost is set against an average decrease in POP‐SS at 12 months of 1.52, which represents a clinically important change in symptoms for women (3). Interpretation of results The intervention was found to be effective: compared to the control group, women's prolapse symptoms were less frequent in the PFMT group at 6 and 12 months, they were more likely to report their prolapse felt better, and less likely to seek further treatment. There was a tendency for more improvement in POP‐Q stage in the intervention group, although this was only marginally significant. The average improvement in the POP‐SS was associated with a cost of £127 per woman. Assuming intervention women gained 10% on their quality of life for a year as a result of the intervention, it is estimated that the cost per quality adjusted life year gained is around £16K. This level of cost per QALY is commonly accepted by organisations such as National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Concluding message There is now sufficient evidence to conclude that PFMT is effective and cost‐effective in reducing prolapse symptoms and should be recommended as first‐line management for prolapse.

AB: Objectives: Telemedical systems (TMS) and data management for implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICD) promise to reduce costs and optimize patient care. Depressive symptoms are common among patients with an ICD and the health related quality of life (HRQoL) is affected by the underlying disease and the implanted device, respectively. TMS might improve the HRQoL of patients and ICDs acceptance due to closer monitoring and, thereby, an increased level of perceived safety. In this RCT, changes in the level of depression, HRQoL and ICD‐acceptance over a period of six months after ICD‐implantation were investigated. Methods: A total of 161 patients (80.7% male; age: 64,1+/‐14,6; 82% with coronary disease, 11% with DCM) with an ICD were randomized at the day of implantation into intervention (n= 82) or control group (n= 79). The intervention group was equipped with a telemonitoring‐system that transferred ICD‐data from the patients' home to the medical practitioner. The control group received regular care. Patients were asked to fill out three questionnaires (the generic EQ‐5D, the depression specific HADS and the device specific FPAS); the follow‐up period was six month, with postal surveys on a monthly basis. Results: Nine patients dropped out before survey completion. A total of 140 patients filled out at least two sets of questionnaires and were included in the analyses. After six months the mean improvement in the HRQoL (EQ‐5D‐Index) in the telemonitoring group was 10.7 points compared to baseline (p= .006) while the mean change in HRQoL in the control group was 5.5 (p= .138). FPAS and HADS‐D showed small but non‐significant advantage for the telemonitoring group. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that TMS have the ability to improve HRQoL of patients with ICDs. Results on effects towards depression and anxiety and enhancement of ICDs acceptance are also promising. Since ICDs are used in chronic diseases a longer follow‐up period seems to be required to validate the effects.

AB: Objectives: To explore the experiences of patients and professionals taking part in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of blood glucose, blood pressure (BP) and weight telemonitoring in type 2 diabetes supported by primary care, and identify factors facilitating or hindering the effectiveness of the intervention and those likely to influence its potential translation to routine practice. Design: Qualitative study adopting an interpretive descriptive approach. Participants: 23 patients, 6 nurses and 4 doctors who were participating in a RCT of blood glucose and BP telemonitoring. A maximum variation sample of patients from within the trial based on age, sex and deprivation status of the practice was sought. Setting: 12 primary care practices in Scotland and England. Method: Data were collected via recorded semistructured interviews. Analysis was inductive with themes presented within an overarching thematic framework. Multiple strategies were employed to ensure that the analysis was credible and trustworthy. Results: Telemonitoring of blood glucose, BP and weight by people with type 2 diabetes was feasible. The data generated by telemonitoring supported selfcare decisions and medical treatment decisions. Motivation to self‐manage diet was increased by telemonitoring of blood glucose, and the 'benign policing' aspect of telemonitoring was considered by patients to be important. The convenience of home monitoring was very acceptable to patients although professionals had some concerns about telemonitoring increasing workload and costs. Conclusions: Telemonitoring of blood glucose, BP and weight in primary care is a promising way of improving diabetes management which would be highly acceptable to the type of patients who volunteered for this study.

AB: We conducted a trial of telemonitoring and telecare for patients with chronic heart failure leaving hospital after being treated for clinical instability. Eighty patients were randomized before hospital discharge to a usual care group (n=40: follow‐up at the outpatient clinic) or to an integrated management group (n=40: patients learned to use a handheld PDA and kept in touch daily with the monitoring centre). At enrolment, the groups were similar for all clinical variables. At one‐year follow‐up, integrated management patients showed better adherence, reduced anxiety and depression, and lower NYHA class and plasma levels of BNP with respect to the usual care patients (e.g. NYHA class 2.1 vs 2.4, P<0.02). Mortality and hospital re‐admissions for congestive heart failure were also reduced in integrated management patients (P<0.05). Integrated management was more expensive than usual care, although the cost of adverse events was 42% lower. In heart failure patients at high risk of relapse, the regular acquisition of simple clinical information and the possibility for the patient to contact the clinical staff improved drug titration, produced better psychological status and quality of life, and reduced hospitalizations for heart failure.

AB: Objectives To evaluate the effect of an innovative model integrating telemonitoring of vital parameters and telephone support on 6‐month survival and hospital admissions of elderly adults with heart failure (HF). Design Parallel‐arm, randomized trial. Setting Geriatric acute care ward and outpatient clinic at Policlinico Campus Biomedico (Rome, Italy). Participants Individuals with HF aged 65 and older (mean age 80) randomly assigned to intervention (n = 50) or control (n = 46). Participants had an average ejection fraction of 46%. Intervention Telemonitoring system (receives and communicates oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure readings) and office‐hours telephonic support provided by a geriatrician. Measurements Combination of all‐cause death and hospital admissions. Results The two groups were similar with the exception of the prevalence of women and of disability (both more common in the control group). Three patients for each group were lost to follow‐up (final analyzed sample size: 90). Incidence of the main outcome was 42% in the control group and 21% in the intervention group (relative risk = 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.26‐0.98). The results were unchanged after taking into account the setting of enrollment, sex, and disability (hazard ratio = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.19‐0.94). Conclusion Telemonitoring of elderly people with HF is feasible and reduces the risk of death and hospitalization. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the cost‐efficacy of the service.

AB: Evidence of clinical benefit and cost‐effectiveness from daily symptom and simple telemonitoring in COPD is unproven. The CHROMED study explored the effect of telemonitoring in older people with COPD and significant co‐morbidity who performed daily forced oscillation measurements via RESMON PRO DIARY to identify early physiological change associated with an exacerbation Six centres in 5 countries randomised 312 people to 9 months telemonitoring (154) or daily symptom questionnaires (158). Each day the monitored group recorded symptoms, pulse, BP, oxygen saturation and airway resistance and reactance. An alert was generated if results exceeded pre‐determined parameters and the participant was contacted by their local clinical centre to consider additional treatment Baseline characteristics were evenly matched: mean age 71 years, FEV1 1.3L (50% predicted) and SGRQ score 49. 61 % of subjects had 2+ exacerbations and 42% had been hospitalised in the previous year Time to first hospitalisation did not differ albeit the monitoring group had fewer hospitalisations (79 vs 103; p=ns) and days in hospital (329 vs. 650; p=ns). However, subjects hospitalized with an AE COPD in the previous year (n=128) had a lower hospitalisation rate (p<0.04). Quality of life (EQ‐5D) and health status (CAT) did not differ between groups. Mean cost in the monitored group was marginally lower (€4,615 vs €4,831; p=ns) Telemonitoring including daily forced oscillation impacted neither time to first hospitalisation nor health status. Reduction in hospitalisation rate in subjects with previous hospitalisation suggests these individuals may benefit from telemonitoring and earlier treatment.

AB: The majority of people affected by Multiple Sclerosis (paMS) experience severe and disabling fatigue. A recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed that cognitive behaviour therapy with a clinical psychologist was an effective treatment for MS fatigue. An Internet‐based version of this intervention, MS Invigor8, was developed for the current study using agile design and input from paMS. MS Invigor8 includes eight tailored, interactive sessions. The aim was to test the feasibility and potential efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of the programme in a pilot RCT. 40 patients were randomised to MS Invigor8 (n=23) or standard care (n=17). The MS Invigor8 group accessed sessions over 8‐10 weeks and received up to three 30‐60min telephone support sessions. Participants completed online standardised questionnaires assessing fatigue, mood, quality of life and service use at baseline and 10 weeks follow‐up. Large between group treatment effects were found for the primary outcomes of fatigue severity (d=1.19) and impact (d=1.02). The MS Invigor8 group also reported significantly greater improvements in anxiety, depression and quality‐adjusted life years. These data suggest that Internet‐based CBT may be a clinically and cost‐effective treatment for MS fatigue. A larger RCT with longer term follow‐up is warranted.

AB: OBJECTIVE: The Trial of Wii™ in Stroke investigated the efficacy of using the Nintendo Wii Sports™ (WiiTM) to improve affected arm function after stroke. DESIGN: Multicentre, pragmatic, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Home‐based rehabilitation. SUBJECTS: A total of 240 participants aged 24‐90 years with arm weakness following a stroke within the previous six months. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to exercise daily for six weeks using the WiiTM or arm exercises at home. MAIN MEASURES: Primary outcome was change in the affected arm function at six weeks follow‐up using the Action Research Arm Test. Secondary outcomes included occupational performance, quality of life, arm function at six months and a cost effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: The study was completed by 209 participants (87.1%). There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of affected arm function at six weeks follow‐up (mean difference ‐1.7, 95% CI ‐3.9 to 0.5, p = 0.12) and no significant difference in secondary outcomes, including occupational performance, quality of life or arm function at six months, between the two groups. No serious adverse events related to the study treatment were reported. The cost effectiveness analysis showed that the WiiTM was more expensive than arm exercises £1106 (SD 1656) vs. £730 (SD 829) (probability 0.866). CONCLUSION: The trial showed that the WiiTM was not superior to arm exercises in home‐based rehabilitation for stroke survivors with arm weakness. The WiiTM was well tolerated but more expensive than arm exercises.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Medication nonadherence is a serious issue in clinical trials, especially in studies of substance abuse disorders. Measuring and confirming adherence is critical to ensuring that collected data is accurate and interpretable. This study evaluated the feasibility and success of a smartphone‐based approach (Cellphone Assisted Remote Observation of Medication Adherence [CAROMA]) to visually confirm medication adherence in a clinical trial. METHOD: Medication adherence was confirmed visually via smartphones provided to participants in a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial for cannabis dependence. Every morning, subjects (n=20) were video‐called by staff who observed consumption of study medication. Adherence was also assessed with weekly face‐to‐face visits, pill counts and plasma drug levels. Subjects were paid for completing daily CAROMA visits, and for returning the smartphone at study completion. RESULTS: CAROMA confirmed 96.04% adherence to medication. Concordance between expected and actual remaining study medication counted at weekly study visits was 87.69%. Subjects assigned to active study medication had detectable plasma drug levels, while those assigned to placebo did not. CAROMA was estimated to cost approximately $100 per subject per week ‐ a total of $300.24 per subject for the 3‐week outpatient portion of the trial. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility, success and cost‐effectiveness of CAROMA to facilitate and confirm medication adherence in a clinical trial. Preliminary findings support larger and longer studies, and possibly applying this approach to clinical care ‐ especially in other populations with high rates of medication nonadherence.

AB: Background and Introduction: Telerehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is supported by strong evidence on the effectiveness of such intervention and from a cost‐benefit point of view. Satisfaction of patients toward in‐home telerehabilitation after TKA has not yet been examined thoroughly in large‐scale clinical trials. This study aims to compare satisfaction level of patients following in‐home telerehabilitation (TELE) after TKA to one of the patients following a usual face‐to‐face home visit (STD) rehabilitation. Secondarily, to determine if any clinical or personal variables were associated to the level of satisfaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was embedded in a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 205 patients randomized into two groups. Rehabilitation intervention was the same for both groups; only approach for service delivery differed (telerehabilitation or home visits). Participants were assessed at baseline (before TKA), at hospital discharge, and at 2 and 4 months postdischarge (E4) using functional outcomes. Patient satisfaction was measured using the validated Health Care Satisfaction Questionnaire (HCSQ) at E4. RESULTS: Characteristics of all participants were similar at baseline. Satisfaction level of both groups did not differ and was very high (over 85%). It was neither correlated to personal characteristics nor to improvements of functional level from preoperative to E4. Satisfaction was rather found associated to walking and stair‐climbing performances. CONCLUSIONS: These results, in conjunction with evidences of clinical effectiveness and cost benefits demonstrated in the same sample of patients, strongly support the use of telerehabilitation to improve access to rehabilitation services and efficiency of service delivery after TKA.

AB: The investigators community based resource center has implemented visit preparation by prompting patients to write down their questions. This is a proven approach to increasing the number of questions and concerns that patients voice during their visits with doctors. The resource center's usual practice is to provide their visit preparation intervention, called Consultation Planning, through in‐person counseling sessions. This study asks whether telephone delivery of Consultation Planning would be almost as effective in terms of increasing patient's decision self‐efficacy, or confidence in their ability to navigate decisions effectively with their physicians. The study also asks about the cost‐effectiveness of telephone delivery compared to in‐person delivery. The investigators are answering these questions through a randomized, controlled, non‐inferiority trial with two arms: in‐person versus telephone delivery of Consultation Planning. The investigators are measuring self‐reported psychological outcomes such as decision self‐efficacy (primary outcome), preparation for decision making, anxiety, and distress, along with economic outcomes such as health resource utilization and willingness to pay. The investigators hypothesize that Tele‐CP can be delivered at a lower patient and resource center cost than in‐person CP, and that it will be as effective in terms of impact on a patient's decisional self‐efficacy.

AB: BACKGROUND T o examine the methodology used to evaluate whether focusing the work of nurse practitioners and a pharmacist on frail and at‐risk patients would improve the quality of care for such patients. DESIGN: Evaluation of methodology of a randomized controlled trial including analysis of quantitative and qualitative data over time and analysis of cost‐effectiveness. SETTING: A single practice in a rural area near Ottawa, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 241 frail patients, aged 50 years and older, at risk of experiencing adverse health outcomes. INTERVENTION: At‐risk patients were randomly assigned to receive Anticipatory and Preventive Team Care (from their family physicians, 1 of 3 nurse practitioners, and a pharmacist) or usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The principal outcome for the study was the quality of care for chronic disease management. Secondary outcomes included other quality of care measures and evaluation of the program process and its cost‐effectiveness. This article examines the effectiveness of the methodology used. Quantitative data from surveys, administrative databases, and medical records were supplemented with qualitative information from interviews, focus groups, work logs, and study notes. CONCLUSION: Three factors limit our ability to fully demonstrate the potential effects of this team structure. For reasons outside our control, the intervention duration was shorter than intended; the practice's physical layout did not facilitate interactions between the care providers; and contamination of the intervention effect into the control arm cannot be excluded. The study used a randomized design, relied on a multifaceted approach to evaluating its effects, and used several sources of data. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER NCT00238836 (CONSORT).

AB: Background and Introduction: Telerehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is supported by strong evidence on the effectiveness of such intervention and from a cost‐benefit point of view. Satisfaction of patients toward in‐home telerehabilitation after TKA has not yet been examined thoroughly in large‐scale clinical trials. This study aims to compare satisfaction level of patients following in‐home telerehabilitation (TELE) after TKA to one of the patients following a usual face‐to‐face home visit (STD) rehabilitation. Secondarily, to determine if any clinical or personal variables were associated to the level of satisfaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was embedded in a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 205 patients randomized into two groups. Rehabilitation intervention was the same for both groups; only approach for service delivery differed (telerehabilitation or home visits). Participants were assessed at baseline (before TKA), at hospital discharge, and at 2 and 4 months postdischarge (E4) using functional outcomes. Patient satisfaction was measured using the validated Health Care Satisfaction Questionnaire (HCSQ) at E4. RESULTS: Characteristics of all participants were similar at baseline. Satisfaction level of both groups did not differ and was very high (over 85%). It was neither correlated to personal characteristics nor to improvements of functional level from preoperative to E4. Satisfaction was rather found associated to walking and stair‐climbing performances. CONCLUSIONS: These results, in conjunction with evidences of clinical effectiveness and cost benefits demonstrated in the same sample of patients, strongly support the use of telerehabilitation to improve access to rehabilitation services and efficiency of service delivery after TKA.

AB: PURPOSE: Our objective was to assess how telephonic review of outpatients with stable epilepsy compared with conventional face‐to‐face clinic management. METHODS: We constructed a randomized parallel group study of suitable patients attending our Epilepsy Clinic and compared telephonic review with conventional clinic visit based management. Primary outcomes were the percentage of patients with breakthrough seizures and total number of breakthrough seizures. We also compared cost, patient satisfaction and numbers defaulting. RESULTS: A total of 465 patients were randomized and 429 were included in the final analysis. There was no significant difference in breakthrough seizures between the two groups. Mean time spent in the consultation was 10min in the telephone group (FT) and 22h in the face‐to‐face group (FC) and cost was INR 865 more expensive on an average in the FC group. Satisfaction was over 90% in the FT group. Significantly more people in the FC group were lost to follow‐up. CONCLUSION: This study provides Class I evidence that the number of stable epilepsy patients who have breakthrough seizures and the total number of breakthrough seizures remain the same irrespective of whether patients are reviewed telephonically or face‐to‐face in the clinic. Clinicians managing epilepsy patients should consider using telephonic review for selected patients. Telephonic reviews have the potential of effectively reducing the secondary treatment gap in millions of patients who do not have easy access to doctors.

AB: Balance disorders are a common impairment after an acquired brain injury (ABI). Neurorehabilitation programs focus on the rehabilitation of balance skills to enhance patients' self‐dependency. The Wii Balance Board has been adopted with rehabilitative purposes due to its low cost and widespread battery of exercises. However, this entertainment system is oriented to healthy people and cannot easily adapt to the patient's motor (and possible cognitive) deficits. The objective of this study was two‐fold: a) to study whether custom‐made rehabilitative exercises on a force platform could improve the balance condition of ABI patients compared with conventional physical therapy programs; and b) to study if their clinical effects persisted in absence of the virtual training. To prove the first hypothesis, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was carried out involving 17 ABI participants (control group: 8 participants; experimental group: 9 participants). To prove the second hypothesis a follow‐up study (FUS) was carried out involving 7 ABI participants. The participants of both studies underwent 20 1‐h sessions, from 3 to 5 sessions per week. The participants were assessed at the beginning and at the end of the treatment (RCT, FUS) and 1 month after the therapy (FUS). Significant improvements were detected in some scales for those participants who underwent the virtual therapy (RCT). The effects persisted over time (FUS). Balance training through low‐cost force platforms and custom‐made exercises can provide lasting clinical benefits to ABI chronic patients when compared to conventional treatments.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Healthy Directions 2 (HD2) intervention in the primary care setting. METHODS: HD2 was a cluster randomized trial (conducted 3/09‐11/11). The primary sampling unit was provider (n=33), with secondary sampling of patients within provider (n=2440). Study arms included: 1) usual care (UC); 2) HD2‐‐a patient self‐guided intervention targeting 5 risk behaviors; and 3) HD2 plus 2 brief telephone coaching calls (HD2+CC). The outcome measure was the proportion of participants with a lower multiple risk behavior (MRB) score by follow‐up. RESULTS: At baseline, only 4% of the participants met all behavioral recommendations. Both HD2 and HD2+CC led to improvements in MRB score, relative to UC, with no differences between the two HD2 conditions. Twenty‐eight percent of the UC participants had improved MRB scores at 6 months, vs. 39% and 43% in HD2 and HD2+CC, respectively (ps≤.001); results were similar at 18 months (p≤.05). The incremental cost of one risk factor reduction in MRB score was $310 for HD2 and $450 for HD2+CC. CONCLUSIONS: Self‐guided and coached intervention conditions had equivalent levels of effect in reducing multiple chronic disease risk factors, were relatively low cost, and thus are potentially useful for routine implementation in similar health settings.

To assess patients' quality of life and satisfaction with telecare intervention. 4. To assess the effect of telecare intervention on insulin adjustment to consumed carbohydrates. 2. Working hypothesis Telecare can be used for efficient management of T1DM in adults using insulin pump, in lieu of frequent clinic visits. 3. Methodology A randomized controlled prospective trial for one year. Intervention group: Each patient will transmit glucometer and pump data electronically via a web site (Medtronic Carelink internet site www.carelink.minimed.com) to diabetes team and will receive feedback by telephone. Frequency of data transfer will be directly related to patients' metabolic control. In addition to data transmission Patient of the intervention group will be arriving during the intervention year for 3 clinic visit at the following time point : 0, 6 and 12 month. Control group: 3‐month routine clinic visits 4. Significance of the proposed research (its uniqueness and innovation) Telecare potentially offers a method for efficient continuous care management of patients with T1DM using insulin pump in lieu of clinic visits. It enables real time responses of clinical personnel and increases patient involvement. This trial will be the first telecare intervention lasting for one year to determine if treatment is as efficient as face to face visits, thus enabling cost reduction and time saving without affecting the quality of care. .

AB: OBJECTIVE: This study aims to test two telephone‐delivered interventions for their efficacy in improving quality of life (QOL) (psychological, physical, social, and spiritual) among Latinas with breast cancer and their family members or friends (labeled supportive partners in this study). METHODS: Latinas with breast cancer and their supportive partners (SPs) were randomly assigned to one of two telephone delivered 8‐week interventions: (i) telephone interpersonal counseling (TIP‐C) or (ii) telephone health education (THE). QOL assessments were made at baseline, immediately after the 8‐week interventions ended, and at an 8‐week follow‐up. Seventy Latinas and their 70 SPs completed all assessments (36 in health education and 34 in counseling) and were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Both Latinas with breast cancer and their SPs had significant improvements in virtually all dimensions of QOL over the 16 weeks of the investigation. However, there was no evidence documenting the superiority of either intervention for improving QOL. Preliminary cost analysis found that the counseling intervention cost about $164.68 for one dyad compared with $107.03 for health education. The majority of participants reported benefit from the intervention and liked that the intervention was in Spanish, included SPs, and was delivered by telephone. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that relatively brief, culturally appropriate, and highly accessible telephone‐delivered interventions that provide emotional and information support can bring about substantial improvements in QOL for both Latinas with breast cancer and their SPs.

AB: Introduction This was a pilot study to examine the effects of home telemonitoring (TM) of patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods A randomised controlled 12‐month trial of 42 patients with severe COPD was conducted. Home TM of oximetry, temperature, pulse, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, spirometry, and weight with telephone support and home visits was tested against a control group receiving only identical telephone support and home visits. Results The results suggest that TM had a reduction in COPD‐related admissions, emergency department presentations, and hospital bed days. TM also seemed to increase the interval between COPD‐related exacerbations requiring a hospital visit and prolonged the time to the first admission. The interval between hospital visits was significantly different between the study arms, while the other findings did not reach significance and only suggest a trend. There was a reduction in hospital admission costs. TM was adopted well by most patients and eventually, also by the nursing staff, though it did not seem to change patients' psychological well‐being. Discussion Ability to draw firm conclusions is limited due to the small sample size. However the trends of reducing hospital visits warrant a larger study of a similar design. When designing such a trial, one should consider the potential impact of the high quality of care already made available to this patient cohort.

AB: Background: Hospitals are the standard of care for management of acute illness, but hospital care can be unsafe, uncomfortable, and expensive. Providing substitutive hospital‐level care in a patient's home potentially reduces cost while improving quality and safety, although evidence from randomized controlled trials in the US is lacking. Methods: We present preliminary data from the first US randomized controlled trial of hospital‐level care at home versus usual care at an academic medical center and a community hospital. Patients who presented to the emergency department with any infection, heart failure exacerbation, COPD/asthma exacerbation, and 7 other medical diagnoses were eligible to enroll and be randomized only after an admission decision was made. Patients were excluded if they lived over 5 miles away or were medically unstable by applicable disease‐specific risk scores. Patients randomized to home received at least 1 daily physician visit, 2 daily nurse visits, 24/7 video and text contact with clinicians, continuous vital signs monitoring, medications by any route, and portable diagnostics. Additional services were tailored to each patient as needed, such as physical therapy, social work, and food delivery. Our primary outcome was direct cost of the acute care episode. We calculated cost by totaling non‐physician labor, supplies, medications, labs, radiology, and transport. We secondarily studied utilization (eg, labs, consultations), 30‐day read‐mission, and quality and safety (eg, adverse events, physical activity via vital signs monitor). We compared groups with Wilcoxon rank sum, t, and Fisher exact tests as appropriate. Results: Thirty‐seven patients (23 female, 20 white; mean age 76) ran‐domized to home; 45 patients (28 female, 19 white; mean age 68) randomized to control. Median direct cost of the acute care episode for home patients was 38% (p=0.02) lower than for control patients. During the care episode, home patients had fewer lab orders (mean per admission: 3 vs 23; p< 0.01) and less often received imaging (14% v 71%; p< 0.01) or consultations (3% vs 33%; p< 0.01). Home patients were less often readmitted within 30 days (5% v 22%; p=0.02). One control patient incurred a hospital‐acquired Clostridium difficile infection and 1 unexpectedly died within 30‐days of discharge. No similar events occurred in home patients, nor did any home patients require transfer back to the hospital. Home patients were less sedentary (mean percent of the day sedentary, 93% v 97%; p=0.01) and more often upright (mean percent of the day upright, 30% v 19%; p=0.02). Conclusions: In this ongoing randomized controlled trial of patients admitted with acute illness, the use of substitutive home hospitalization compared to usual care in the hospital reduced cost, utilization, and readmission while improving physical activity. Preliminary results suggest quality and safety were maintained or improved, with more definitive results awaiting completion of enrollment.

AB: BACKGROUND: Home‐based exercise training in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has the potential to improve CR uptake, decrease costs and increase self‐management skills. The FIT@Home study evaluates home‐based CR with telemonitoring guidance using coaching interventions including strategies for behavioural changes with the aim to maintain adherence to a healthy lifestyle and to improve long‐term effects. In this interim analysis we provide short‐term results on exercise capacity, quality of life and training adherence of the first 50 patients included in the FIT@Home study. DESIGN: The study design was a randomised controlled trial. METHODS: Low to moderate risk CR patients were randomised to a 12‐week home‐based training (HT) programme or a 12‐week centre‐based training (CT) programme. In both groups, training was performed at 70‐85% of maximal heart rate (HRmax) for 45‐60 min, 2‐3 times per week. The HT group received three supervised training sessions, before commencing training with a heart rate monitor in their home environment. These patients received individual coaching by telephone weekly, based on training data uploaded on the Internet. The CT programme was performed under the direct supervision of a physical therapist. Exercise capacity and health‐related quality of life were assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks. RESULTS: CT (n = 25) and HT (n = 25) both showed a significant improvement in peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) (10% and 14% respectively) and quality of life after 12 weeks of training, without significant between‐group differences. The average training intensity of the HT group was 73.3 ± 3.5% of HRmax. Training adherence was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: This analysis shows that HT with telemonitoring guidance has similar short‐term effects on exercise capacity and quality of life as CT in CR patients.

AB: Both congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are more common among Māori than non‐Māori people, and the cultural acceptability of home‐based remote monitoring technology has not been tested. We conducted a 12‐month pilot trial of home telemonitoring. Patients were randomly assigned to the control and intervention groups. Patients in the control group showed no clear differences in quality of life at the end of the trial. The telehealth group showed a consistent trend towards improved quality of life on several instruments, including the SF‐36, the St George Respiratory Questionnaire and the K10 questionnaire; the improvement in the latter was significant. Hospitalizations were reduced in both the control (‐19%) and telehealth group (‐25%). Patient interviews indicated that the technology was acceptable to most patients and their families, including the Māori. The results from the pilot trial suggest that wider implementation with a cost benefit evaluation could be worthwhile.

YR: 2017

AB: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first choice of treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Although adherence is critical for achieving a good treatment effect, and early intervention if treatment problems emerge is important for achieving good adherence, information on patient compliance is usually based on assessment of the first few weeks of treatment. Telemedicine technology allows for monitoring of CPAP pressure, air leaks, apnea‐hypopnea index (AHI) and compliance on a daily basis and could therefore be an option allowing for adequate support and quick response if a patient has problems with the treatment. In addition, improving early experiences of CPAP, identifying patients in need of more intensive support could potentially improve adherence but also reduced cost of care, and increased patient satisfaction. The proposed study will recruit 200 OSAS patients starting CPAP treatment; 100 patients randomized to afterwards receiving telemonitoring in combination with telephone calls, and 100 patients randomized to receiving usual office visits. All patients will in addition answer questionnaires on sleep and health, quality of life, and patient satisfaction after the first CPAP information visit and then again after 6 months of treatment. At time of follow‐up all patients will also answer questionnaires on side effects of CPAP. Health economic variables will also be measured throughout the testing period. The study will provide valuable information regarding benefits of telemonitoring in clinical work with CPAP therapy. Implementation of telemedicine‐based monitoring of CPAP therapy may be an important part of increasing adherence among patients but also in the development of a more cost‐effective care as it can provide clinics with increased treatment capacity and follow‐up of both new and established patients. It would further improve the care for these patients who often have a lifelong treatment, which aims to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease or premature death.

AB: Patients with persistent poorly‐controlled diabetes mellitus (PPDM) ‐ defined as maintenance of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >9.0% for >1 year despite Primary Care and/or Endocrinology management ‐ are at particularly high risk for developing complications and generating costs. To address PPDM within the Veterans Affairs (VA) system, we developed Advanced Comprehensive Diabetes Care (ACDC), an intervention comprising telemonitoring, medication management, self‐management behavioral support, and depression management. Delivery of the ACDC intervention utilizes only existing VA telemedicine/clinical staff, making it highly amenable to implementation and scaling. We evaluated ACDC using an effectiveness‐implementation hybrid pilot trial among 50 Veterans with PPDM. Patients were randomized to receive ACDC or usual care for 6 months. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months; we analyzed our primary effectiveness outcome, change in HbA1c, using linear mixed models. Diabetes self‐care (Self‐Care Inventory‐Revised), self‐reported medication adherence (Morisky Medication Adherence Scale), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire‐9) were also assessed. Patients were predominantly male and majority African‐American, mean age was 60, and baseline diabetes control was poor (estimated mean HbA1c 10.5%); 23 patients completed 6‐month follow‐up in each group. Estimated mean HbA1c was 9.2% at 6 months for ACDC patients vs. 10.2% for usual care (estimated difference ‐1.0%, 95% CI ‐2.0 to ‐0.0, p=0.05). Within the ACDC group, "engaged" patients (>6 study encounters, n=16) had an observed mean HbA1c of 8.3% at 6 months vs. 10.8% for "non‐engaged" patients (<6 study encounters, n=7). Relative to usual care, ACDC patients had a statistically significant improvement in diabetes self‐care. By improving HbA1c in a scalable manner, ACDC has substantial potential to improve the management of patients with persistently poor diabetes control despite standard care.

AB: BACKGROUND: Action research (AR) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are usually considered to be theoretically and practically incompatible. However, we argue that their respective strengths and weaknesses can be complementary. We illustrate our argument from a recent study assessing the effect of telemonitoring on health‐related quality of life, self‐care, hospital use, costs and the experiences of patients, informal carers and health care professionals in two urban hospital services and one remote rural primary care service in New Zealand. METHODS: Data came from authors' observations and field notes of discussions with three groups: the healthcare providers and healthcare consumers who participated in the research, and a group of 17 researchers and collaborators. The consumers had heart failure (Site A, urban), airways disease (Site B, urban), and diabetes (Site C, rural). The research ran from 2008 (project inception) until 2012 (project close‐off). Researchers came from a wide range of disciplines. Both RCT and AR methods were recognised from early in the process but often worked in parallel rather than together. In retrospect, we have mapped our observed research processes to the AR cycle characteristics (creation of communicative space, democracy and participation, iterative learning and improvement, emergence, and accommodation of different ways of knowing). RESULTS: We describe the context, conduct and outcomes of the telemonitoring trial, framing the overall process in the language of AR. Although not fully articulated at the time, AR processes made the RCT sensitive to important context, e.g. clinical processes. They resulted in substantive changes to the design and conduct of the RCT, and to interpretation and uptake of findings, e.g. a simpler technology procurement process emerged. Creating a communicative space enabled co‐design between the researcher group and collaborators from the provider participant group, and a stronger RCT design. CONCLUSIONS: It appears possible to enhance the utility of RCTs by explicitly embedding them in an AR framework to shape stronger RCT design. The AR process and characteristics may enable researchers to evaluate telehealth while enhancing rather than compromising the quality of an RCT, where research results are returned to practice as part of the research process.

AB: In recent years home care is becoming increasingly used and considered by some the future of healthcare. Home mechanical ventilation has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic respiratory failure of different aetiologies. A French survey suggests an increase of 12% of cases per year. With the prospect of a substantial increase of ventilated patients at home, facilities and resources have not been proportionally growing, so new approaches should be investigated and addressed to absorb this constant flux of patients. Telemedicine is defined as the broad use of electronic and communications technologies to provide and support remote monitoring of health status. It has been shown to be an effective alternative model of care for managing chronic diseases. It as also been shown to reduce healthcare costs and is a major topic on the agendas of health and social care policies in Europe. Home telemonitoring of respiratory conditions results in early identification of deteriorations in patient condition and symptom control. However, evidence on the magnitude of clinical and structural effects remains preliminary, with variations in study approaches and an absence of robust study designs and formal evaluations. The objective is gathering data that can be help to establish guidelines for non invasive home mechanical ventilation initiation and quality control.

AB: Efforts to reduce early mortality in persons with serious mental illness (SMI) have largely focused on providing integrated primary care in a "health home". Yet medical care alone accounts for a disproportionately small contribution to reductions in early morality in comparison to improving self‐management and health behaviors. Illness self‐management training (SMT) in the general population has been shown to improve health outcomes and lower costs associated with chronic health conditions by teaching and coaching individuals on monitoring symptoms, self‐administering treatments, and improving health behaviors. More recently, the use of technologies such as Automated Telehealth (AT) has been shown to improve outcomes and potentially prevent expensive emergency room and acute hospitalizations in the general population by daily prompting of self‐management and remote monitoring by a nurse who can pre‐emptively intervene, guided by disease management algorithms. To the investigators knowledge, neither of these approaches has been empirically evaluated as an integrated component in a behavioral health home for persons with SMI. The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of 300 persons with SMI and medical comorbidity to evaluate outcomes for n=100 in a Community Based Health Home alone (CBHH), compared to n=100 also receiving Self‐Management Training (CBHH+SMT), and n=100 also receiving Automated Telehealth (CBHH+AT). The investigators will test the following 3 hypotheses: Primary H1: CBHH+SMT and CBHH+AT compared to CBHH alone, will be associated with greater health self‐management (measured by the Self Rated Abilities for Health Practices Scale) and (Exploratory E1) greater mental health self‐management (measured by the Illness Management and Recovery Scale) at 4, 8, 12, and 24‐months. Primary H2: CBHH+SMT and CBHH+AT compared to CBHH alone, will be associated with greater reduction in risk of early mortality (as measured by the Avoidable Mortality Risk Index) and (Exploratory E2) in psychiatric symptoms (BPRS) at 4, 8, 12, and 24 months. Primary H3: CBHH+SMT and CBHH+AT compared to CBHH alone, will be associated with less acute service use (emergency room visits and hospitalizations) and (Exploratory E3) less acute service use costs at 4, 8, 12, and 24‐months. In order to differentiate CBHH+SMT and CBHH+AT if both are found to be effective, the investigators will evaluate the persistence of primary outcomes from intervention endpoint (at 12 months) to the final follow‐up (at 24 months) and will calculate the additional incremental costs of implementing and providing SMT and AT. The investigators will also explore differences in subjective health (SF‐12) and in individual cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., BMI, tobacco use, blood pressure, glucose, lipids), comparing CBHH+SMT, CBHH+AT, and CBHH alone. Finally, the investigators will explore hypothesized mechanisms of action (potential mediators) for the Aim 2 primary outcome of reduced risk of early mortality (i.e., improvement in health self‐management) and for the Aim 3 primary outcome of less acute service use (i.e., medication adherence and number of nurse preemptive interventions).

AB: INTERVENTION: Group 1‐ Physiotherapy and Therapeutic Exercise: a multimodal program comprising education, manual therapy and therapeutic exercise, and a home exercise program. Four, 30 minute physiotherapy sessions will be provided by a qualified physiotherapist over a 4‐week period. Specific manual therapy techniques known as Mobilisation with Movement (MWM) will be applied. In addition, three main groups of exercises will be pragmatically prescribed: (a) Sensorimotor retraining of gripping and forearm movements and posture correction will be commenced early in the physiotherapy intervention; (b) progressive resistance exercise for the wrist extensors will be prescribed based on identified strength deficits in LE; (c) exercises geared towards general arm strengthening. Physiotherapists will prescribe exercises based on the participant's capabilities at any given session to allow for optimal exercise volume and load setting without exacerbating pain. The overriding rule for all exercise is that pain should not be provoked during or after exercise, including avoidance of delayed onset muscle soreness. Exercises will be performed in a slow manner with sufficient rest between sets to allow recovery, and correct form and posture emphasised throughout. Supervision of the home program at the commencement of every session and monitoring of exercise diaries by the treating practitioners will be used to facilitate program adherence and emphasise the importance of the exercise and self‐treatment program. Group 2‐ Prolotherapy injection ‐ the injection solution contains 20% glucose and 0.4% lignocaine. Injection sites will be determined by palpation for tenderness over the lateral epicondyle, the supracondylar ridge, the radial head, the common extensor insertion and the lateral collateral and annular ligaments. Each tender area will receive 0.5 to 1.0 ml using a peppering technique with a 25 gauge needle to a total of 2.0 ml. Injections will be given by a Musculoskeletal Medicine practitioner and will be repeated at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the initial injections, giving a total of 4 treatments, each lasting approximately 30 minutes. Group 3‐ Combination of 1) Physiotherapy and Therapeutic Exercise and 2) Prolotherapy injection. CONDITION: Lateral epicondylalgia (Tennis Elbow) PRIMARY OUTCOME: Assessment of Pain and Functional Disability ‐ using the Patient‐rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) questionnaire. Level of Improvement ‐ The participant's global perceived level of improvement will be measured on a 6‐point Likert scale ranging from 'completely recovered' to 'much worse'. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Costs ‐ The societal perspective will be used, to capture both direct costs related to the management of LE (health professional visits, medications, braces) and indirect costs related to lost productivity. Data on resource use/productivity will be collected monthly via an internet‐based questionnaire with a reminder system to maximise response and minimise recall bias. Quality of Life/Generic Health Status measures: SF‐12 and EQ‐5D‐5L questionnaires. Relative stiffness and variation in peak stiffness using grey scale ultrasound. Ultrasound scanning will be done using a linear array transducer (7.5MHz) integrated into a PC‐based ultrasound system (Echo Blaster 64, TELEMED, Lithiania) with scan settings optimized for optimum tendon characterisation within the image. Gain settings will be fixed throughout all measurements at 50%. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Unilateral lateral elbow pain over the lateral epicondyle of at least 6 weeks duration which is aggravated by gripping, resisted wrist/finger extension and palpation, reduced pain‐free grip force, as well as a minimum pain severity of 30 on a 0‐100 mm visual analogue scale.

AB: The home telemonitoring (HTM) of patients with chronic diseases is a major application of telemedicine. Many projects are under consideration in most developed countries, in order to achieve better efficiency of care and prevent avoidable hospitalizations. The public health system dedicated to American veterans (Veterans Health Administration or VHA) has implemented a telemedicine program (Care Coordination Home Telehealth or CCHT) since the beginning of the 2000s. The VHA has regularly published its results. Its organization relies primarily on methods of self‐management and quantified‐self with the use of an interactive remote monitoring center (Interactive Voice Response). The telehealth part of the CCHT program has treated more than 24,000 patients over 10 years and showed significant medico‐economic results such as a decrease in hospital utilization from 25% in terms of number of days and 17% in financial expenses. The Whole System Demonstrator or WSD was carried out in the United Kingdom from June 2008 to October 2009. It is the largest randomized, controlled study conducted to date (5830patients divided over three British regions). It is unique in its integration of active monitoring of medical care (telehealth), five days a week, of patients with diabetes, congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and passive social monitoring (telecare), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week of persons falling within the criteria of the National Health Service for social care. The main results of the WSD were the subject of eight international publications between 2011 and the end of 2013, which gave answers to the five questions raised initially by the authors' study. The first question concerned the use of goods and hospital health services in particular by patients receiving 12 months of health monitoring and/or social monitoring: the study showed no impact on consumption. The second issue concerned the clinical effectiveness in terms of improvement of morbidity‐mortality, quality of life, and well‐being: the study showed a small reduction of mortality in the telehealth group and some benefits on well‐being in the telecare group. The third issue concerned the economic results of the global use of telehealth and telecare, i.e. the ratio cost/effectiveness and cost/benefit: the study showed an increase in expenditure in telehealth with an unfavorable Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY). The fourth issue concerned the experiences of patients and professionals of health during the period of the WSD study: small profits were shown in the telecare group while medical and non‐medical health professionals have not observed significant impact on their normal practices during the telehealth period. Finally, the fifth question related to the provision of health services and the impact on care organization: the WSD study was considered too rigorous in its conduct to have an impact on the uses of health professionals and too innovative in organizational matters so that the integrated use of telehealth and telecare may become permanent. Lessons can be drawn from these two major studies for future deployments.

AB: The proportion of hypertensive patients achieving adequate blood pressure control meeting guideline targets remains low. Of those patients on blood pressure lowering drugs, only 50% reach control. Objectives: 1. Test the feasibility of telemonitoring of blood pressure in uncontrolled hypertensive patients. 2. Investigate whether telemonitoring enabled self‐measurement of blood pressure leads to faster blood pressure control than self‐measurement without telemonitoring. 3. Secondary endpoints include adverse effects, assessment of quality of life, adherence, a log of technical problems, and cost‐effectiveness. Methods: Randomised parallel‐group study consisting of 4 stages. ‐ Screening to check for eligibility. ‐ Randomisation in a 1:1 proportion to control or experimental arm: In the control arm, doctors will receive reports on the self‐measured blood pressure based on diary cards; in the experimental group, doctors will receive weekly reports via telemonitoring. ‐ Treatment period: Doctors will adjust treatment according to the present guidelines of Hypertension. Blood pressure control is a home blood pressure below 135 mm Hg systolic and 85 mm Hg diastolic. Once blood pressure control is achieved the treatment period ends. ‐ Late follow‐up: Assessment of blood pressure control at home 3 months after completion of the treatment period by means of telemonitoring. Sample size: 120 patients per group. Patients: recruited at clinics from Uruguay and Argentina. Main Inclusion Criteria: ‐ Women and men, age range 20 to 80 years. ‐ Uncontrolled hypertension and new diagnosed hypertension with a self‐measured blood pressure at home of 135 mm Hg systolic and/or 85 mm Hg diastolic or more; ‐ Patients should be willing to accept adherence checking during follow‐up and sign an informed written consent. Exclusion Criteria ‐ Patients emotionally or intellectually not capable of measuring their blood pressure at home; ‐ A clinical or social context, which is suboptimal for the self‐measurement of blood pressure; ‐ Pregnancy; ‐ Alcohol or substance abuse or psychiatric illnesses; ‐ Participation in another study. Expected outcomes: blood pressure control will be achieved faster in the telemonitoring group.

AB: BACKGROUND: Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) suffer from daytime sleepiness, cognitive disorders and are at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. In addition to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), major lifestyle changes to increase physical activity contribute to risk reduction. The daily training duration should be at least 20 minutes to achieve a relevant effect. In addition to exercise training in groups, home training is useful. However, sufficiently intensive training is often not performed because of unavailable feedback (monitoring). It is not clear yet how many patients accept a bicycle home training and to what extent they meet the specified training time. METHOD: Of the 152 consecutive OSA patients surveyed, 74 (48.7 %) agreed to a 4‐week home exercise bike training. After exclusion of 51 patients, 17 for logistical reasons, and 34 because of severe comorbidities, 23 patients remained (age 51.0 +/‐ 9.3 years, BMI 33.7 +/‐ 4.2, ESS score 10.4 +/‐ 6.7, AHI 33.8 +/‐ 24.0). The daily duration of training at the ventilatory threshold (VT1) was recorded and transmitted by a wireless module (Cinterion) via Internet to a doctor or instructor. RESULTS: The patients exercised during 27.3 +/‐ 2.9 days. 19 of the 23 patients (83 %) accomplished the training period of > 20 minutes per day. In 4 patients (17 %) the training time was well below this target level with 5.9 +/‐ 2.3 min. The average training time of all patients was 24.4 +/‐ 9.0 min. CONCLUSION: About 50 % of the OSA patients are interested in a regular physical exercise bike training with telemonitoring, and are performing it quite constantly. The described method of telemonitoring provides a simple and, compared to group training cost‐effective way to reduce cardiovascular risk in OSA.

AB: BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi‐enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS‐VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated. RESULTS: We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS‐VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS‐VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12‐month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4‐10.4; P=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22‐1.69; P=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Screening with twice‐weekly single‐lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory patients ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12‐month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group of patients, supporting further evaluation in an appropriately powered, event‐driven clinical trial.

AB: BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi‐enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients >=65 years of age with a CHADS‐VASc score >=2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated. RESULTS: We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6+/‐5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS‐VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS‐VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12‐month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4‐10.4; P=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10780 (8255). There was a similar number of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard ratio=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22‐1.69; P=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Screening with twice‐weekly single‐lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory patients >=65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12‐month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group of patients, supporting further evaluation in an appropriately powered, event‐driven clinical trial.

AB: Background: The success of novel health care applications depends on a number of factors including clinical effectiveness, cost effectiveness, as well as patient and physician satisfaction. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), our group has recently reported equivalent clinical outcomes between the in‐office and online follow‐up management of psoriasis patients participating in an innovative model of patient‐centered online care. A cost‐effectiveness analysis of this same RCT showed that the online model to be more cost‐effective. In this study, we report patient satisfaction results for this technology‐enabled online model of dermatologic care. Methods: Sixty‐four participants with psoriasis were randomized to receive follow‐up care either in‐office or online over a 24‐week period. Patients randomized to the online group completed visits through a secure online medical visit website. The treating dermatologist responded directly to patients with treatment recommendations through the same web‐based platform. Upon completion of the trial, each patient was given self‐administered survey to evaluate satisfaction with the various aspects of care including confidence in the remote physician, ease of technology, preference for type of consultation, and overall satisfaction with care. Items were rated on a five point Likert scale, ranging from 1‐«strongly agree» to 5‐«strongly disagree» and collapsed into favorable (Likert = 1, 2) versus unfavorable responses, including neutral (Likert = 3, 4, 5). Scores were treated as ordinal data and evaluated using the chi‐square or ManneWhitney tests as appropriate. Results: Overall satisfaction with clinical care was high with no statistically significant difference between the in‐office and on‐line treatment groups (P <.01). 80% of online participants agreed or strongly agreed that the treating dermatologist could evaluate their psoriasis equally to an in‐person visit (P <.001), and 92% of survey participants would consider using an online visit for future psoriasis care. Online participants were also significantly more likely (P < .001) than in‐clinic patients to preferentially select online follow up than waiting 2 months for an in‐clinic follow up appointment. Conclusion: Patient‐centered online care results in high patient satisfaction for the follow‐up management of psoriasis patients.

AB: AIM: To determine the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of a mobile phone intervention to improve exercise capacity and physical activity behaviour in people with ischaemic heart disease (IHD). METHODS AND RESULTS: In this single‐blind, parallel, two‐arm, randomized controlled trial adults (n = 171) with IHD were randomized to receive a mobile phone delivered intervention (HEART; n = 85) plus usual care, or usual care alone (n = 86). Adult participants aged 18 years or more, with a diagnosis of IHD, were clinically stable as outpatients, able to perform exercise, able to understand and write English, and had access to the Internet. The HEART (Heart Exercise And Remote Technologies) intervention involved a personalized, automated package of text messages and a secure website with video messages aimed at increasing exercise behaviour, delivered over 24 weeks. All participants were able to access usual community‐based cardiac rehabilitation, which involves encouragement of physical activity and an offer to join a local cardiac support club. All outcomes were assessed at baseline and 24 weeks and included peak oxygen uptake (PVO2; primary outcome), self‐reported physical activity, health‐related quality of life, self‐efficacy and motivation (secondary outcomes). Results showed no differences in PVO2 between the two groups (difference ‐0.21 ml kg(‐1)min(‐1), 95% CI: ‐1.1, 0.7; p = 0.65) at 24 weeks. However significant treatment effects were observed for selected secondary outcomes, including leisure time physical activity (difference 110.2 min/week, 95% CI: ‐0.8, 221.3; p = 0.05) and walking (difference 151.4 min/week, 95% CI: 27.6, 275.2; p = 0.02). There were also significant improvements in self‐efficacy to be active (difference 6.2%, 95% CI: 0.2, 12.2; p = 0.04) and the general health domain of the SF36 (difference 2.1, 95% CI: 0.1, 4.1; p = 0.03) at 24 weeks. The HEART programme was considered likely to be cost‐effective for leisure time activity and walking. CONCLUSIONS: A mobile phone intervention was not effective at increasing exercise capacity over and above usual care. The intervention was effective and probably cost‐effective for increasing physical activity and may have the potential to augment existing cardiac rehabilitation services.

AB: Background: Troop deployment for OIF/OEF has been extensive for the past five years Among returning veterans, up to 18.5% are diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition to its positive symptoms (intrusive thoughts, reexperiencing, hyperarousal, and avoidance), PTSD is associated with social maladjustment, poor quality of life, medical comorbidity, and general symptom severity. Social and emotional problems include social avoidance, guilt, anger, and unemployment, impulsive or violent behavior, and family discord. A majority (> 90%) of veterans seeking treatment for PTSD also seek disability compensation for debilitating occupational impairment and there are virtually no administrative or research data to indicate veterans are recovering from PTSD. Exposure therapy, which operates on long‐established and fundamental principles of behavior therapy, offers hope for acute symptom alleviation, but may not address severe social impairment. Objectives/Hypothesis: To test the hypothesis that Trauma Management Therapy (TMT), which combines individual virtual reality (VR) assisted exposure therapy with group social and emotional rehabilitation skills training (will be superior to a treatment consisting of the same VR‐ exposure and group psychoeducational group therapy. Outcome will be assessed using relevant clinical, process, and cost outcomes. Additionally, we will assess the potential of olfactory stimulation as a trigger for PTSD symptoms of intrusive thoughts and re‐experiencing. Therefore, this proposal will integrate clinical and neurobiological assessment studies designed to understand the role of these factors in the etiology, maintenance, and treatment of PTSD. Specific Aims: There are three specific aims: First, we will evaluate the efficacy of Trauma Management Therapy (TMT) for the treatment of PTSD in OIF/OEF and determine if TMT (which combines exposure and social/emotional rehabilitation) improves social/emotional functioning compared to our comparison group (exposure plus psychoeducational group therapy). Second, we will explore olfactory activation patterns that may aid understanding of brain mechanisms in PTSD. Third, we will determine TMT's cost efficacy using treatment expenses and resource utilization measures. Study Design: In a prospective randomized clinical trial we will test the superiority of TMT for OIF/OEF veterans with PTSD compared to exposure therapy plus psychoeducational group therapy. TMT combines VR assisted exposure therapy (VR‐EXP) with social and emotional rehabilitation (SER). In addition to clinical, process, and cost outcomes relevant to PTSD for this population, we will include fMRI assessment of the central olfactory system in order to document its hypothesized role in fear acquisition and maintenance. Relevant outcome domains will be reassessed at mid‐treatment, post‐treatment, and 3‐ and 6‐month follow‐up.

TI: Comparing Behavioral Assessments Using Telehealth for Children With Autism

YR: 2015
KY: Autism Spectrum Disorder
AB: Managing challenging behavior in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can profoundly improve quality of life for children and families. However, many families lack access to research‐based treatment, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA). This study is a randomized trial comparing outcomes of treatment for ASD using either a standard Functional Analysis Plus Functional Communication Training (FA+FCT) package or a pragmatic version that offers a briefer, less time‐intensive model of FA+FCT. Both types of FA+FCT are provided via telehealth in family homes to maximize generalizability to real‐life settings. Providing ABA through telehealth makes an effective treatment accessible across geographic barriers so that no child is excluded based on where they live. The study also examines key family factors that influence successful outcomes. The study has 3 primary aims: (1) To assess outcomes for ABA telehealth by assigning children to either a Pragmatic FA+FCT group or to a group receiving Standard FA+FCT. Outcomes will be compared based on the percent reduction in problem behavior, communication increases, time to achieve outcomes, treatment fidelity, family acceptance of treatment, and generalization and maintenance of treatment gains. (2) The study will assess the relation of family factors to treatment efficacy and acceptability by assessing parent stress, mood, and social support in relation to outcomes. (3) Cost effectiveness will be assessed in relation to the treatment methods used and the efficiency of ABA telehealth. The study will include 102 children who meet eligibility criteria from among a larger sample of 150 children. Thirty‐six children will receive intervention in each of three states: Iowa, Georgia, and Texas. Study design is a randomized trial using an intent‐to‐treat analysis. Half of the sample will be randomized to Pragmatic FA+FCT and half to Standard FA+FCT. Treatment will be provided via telehealth using FCT, which is a function‐based ABA technique in which parents are trained to be therapists under the direction of behavior consultants. Study procedures typically are completed within 6 months, and follow‐up assessments occur 6 months after treatment completion. Data analyses include comparisons between assessment groups, single‐case designs examining responses in individual children, cost analyses, and regression analyses of the effects of family factors on outcomes. The investigators prior research shows that problem behavior can be reduced by over 90% in most children with ASD after 4‐6 months of telehealth treatment. If Pragmatic FA+FCT can reduce problem behavior at rates comparable to Standard FA+FCT, then treatment can be started sooner and families can achieve successful outcomes at lower cost. Although pragmatic FA+FCT provides less behavioral information, it may be more resistant to treatment relapse because it does not involve reinforcing high rates of problem behavior.

AB: BACKGROUND: Health care providers aim to stimulate self‐management in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients. However, they have a limited number of patient contacts to do this. With the growing number of T2DM patients, innovative and cost‐effective interventions to promote self‐management are needed. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of diabetes self‐management education via a smartphone app in T2DM patients on insulin therapy. METHODS: Non‐blinded two‐arm multi‐centre randomised controlled superiority trial with parallel‐groups and equal randomisation ('TRIGGER study'). Eligible patients are 40‐70 years, on insulin therapy since at least 3 months, with HbA1c >53 mmol/mol (>7%). In total 228 patients will be recruited. The intervention group (n=114) will receive diabetes self‐management education via a smartphone app to trigger diabetes self‐management: unidirectional text messages, free of charge, evidence and psychological theory based, with regard to dietary habits, physical activity, hypoglycaemia and glucose variability. Patients choose their preferred frequency (two to six times per week), topics (two or three additionally to hypoglycaemia, which is an obligatory topic), and duration (6 or 9 months). The control group (n=114) will receive care‐as‐usual. The primary study endpoint is the HbA1c level after a follow‐up of 6 months. The percentage of patients who achieve an HbA1c level<=53 mmol/mol (<=7%) without hypoglycaemia (plasma glucose <3.5 mmol/L (<63 mg/dL)) is a co‐primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are body mass index, waist circumference, insulin dose, lipid profile, blood pressure, number of hypoglycaemic events, glycaemic variability, self‐management (SDSCA), food habits (FFQ), physical activity (IPAQ), health status (EQ‐5D‐5 L, SF36), diabetes‐dependent quality of life (ADDQoL), diabetes treatment satisfaction (DTSQ), satisfaction with the app, the cost‐effectiveness of the intervention after 3 months, and sustainability of the intervention effect (3 months extra follow‐up in intervention group to compare prolonged to discontinued use of the app). We will use the intention‐to‐treat principle to analyse data. DISCUSSION: Innovative solutions are needed to improve the (cost‐) effectiveness of self‐management for the increasing number of T2DM patients. This trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness of a newly developed smartphone app, designed to trigger diabetes self‐management.

AB: Background: Patients with haematological malignancies are at increased risk of serious/life‐threatening chemotherapy toxicities. We have previously developed a highly acceptable system to remotely monitor/manage chemotherapy toxicities of haematological cancer patients in the community setting. This phase II trial combines the remote monitoring system with a novel nurse‐led intervention (PRISMS). Aims: To pilot the intervention to: estimate potential effect sizes/coefficients of variation to form the basis of power calculations; calculate patient recruitment/retention rates; assess intervention compliance rates. Methods/design: Thirty patients are being recruited from two Melbourne hospitals. Eligibility criteria include: diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic leukaemia/ Hodgkin's/Non‐Hodgkin's lymphoma; aged 18 years. Patients are randomized 1:1 to either the control or intervention arm. Patients allocated to the control arm receive 'Usual Care' whilst those allocated to the intervention will receive the PRISMS intervention in addition to 'Usual Care'. Randomization is stratified by site/diagnosis/Chemotherapy toxicity. Intervention patients will be provided with a computer tablet and software prompting twice‐daily completion of physical/emotional indicators (eg temperature/ depression/distress) and side‐effects (eg vomiting) for four treatment cycles. Should patient data exceed pre‐determined limits an email alert is delivered to the treatment team with nurses logging‐in to view historical data/provide clinical intervention. In addition 6 scheduled nursing interventions support patients in device usage/self care. Trial outcomes assess: symptom severity, psychological distress/anxiety/depression, quality‐of‐life (pen‐and‐paper questionnaires); health service useage/costs (medical record audit/interview); intervention compliance (system logs). Discussion: This trial is the first in the world to both develop a remote monitoring system for haematological cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and to combine the system with a nurse‐led intervention. Findings from this trial are essential so that a future phase III trial is not undermined by poor compliance, recruitment/retention rates and smaller than expected effect sizes. The future use of such monitoring systems have the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care costs.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of a trial of patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) for monitoring primary care patients with depression. DESIGN: Partly individually randomised, partly cluster‐randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Nine general practices in Southern England. PARTICIPANTS: 47 adults with new episodes of depression: 22 intervention, 25 control. RANDOMISATION: Remote computerised sequence generation and allocation. INTERVENTIONS: Patient Health Questionnaire, Distress Thermometer Analogue Scale and PSYCHLOPS problem profile for monitoring depression, following diagnosis and at 10‐35 days later. Feedback of scores to patients was determined by practitioners. BLINDING: Non‐blinded, using self‐completed measures. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI‐II). SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), EuroQol Five‐item, Five‐level (EQ‐5D‐5L) Scale for quality of life, modified Client Service Receipt Inventory for costs, Medical Informant Satisfaction Scale (MISS), qualitative interviews with 14 patients and 13 practice staff about feasibility and acceptability of trial design. RESULTS: Three practices failed to recruit the target of six patients in 12 months. Follow‐up rates were intervention patients: 18 (82%) at 12 weeks and 15 (68%) at 26 weeks; controls: 18 (72%) and 15 (60%), respectively. At 12 weeks, mean BDI‐II score was lower among intervention group patients than controls by 5.8 points (95% CI ‐11.1 to ‐0.5), adjusted for baseline differences and clustering. WSAS scores were not significantly different. At 26 weeks, there were no significant differences in symptoms, social functioning, quality of life or costs, but mean satisfaction score was higher among controls by 22.0 points (95% CI ‐40.7 to ‐3.29). Intervention patients liked completing PROMs, but were disappointed when practitioners did not use the results to inform management. CONCLUSIONS: PROMs may improve depression outcome in the short term, even if PROM scores do not inform practitioners' management. Challenges in recruiting and following up patients need addressing for a definitive trial of relatively brief measures which can potentially inform management. https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=97492541 TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN 97492541; Pre‐results.

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03764709
YR: 2018
AB: Background and Rationale* In IMU there is an increasing concentration of patients with serious illness, under acute exacerbation of previous diseases, elderly patients with co‐morbidities and/or fragility, needing high intensity care. Those patients need an overall evaluation of the rank of severity, complexity and dependence of their pathology, together with an evaluation of their risk of clinical deterioration, to implement a stratification of optimal treatments, intensity of care, length of stay. This could allow to optimize the approach to the complexity of the patients while helping containing costs, not only on the patients who are evaluated during their stay in IMUs, but also in those patients who undergo protected hospital discharge or transition to subacute intensive care unit. Objectives* Some preliminary data on wireless monitoring in IMU have shown that the timely identification of clinical instability could led to a shorter length of stay. Monitoring on clinically unstable patients lets to prevent the deterioration of adverse events, thus allowing a rapid onset of intervention. There are some expected outcomes following the adoption of a wireless clinical monitoring system: 1. Shorter length of stay and earlier discharge 2. Lower transition rate to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 3. Earlier transition of patients from higher to lower intensity of care 4. Shorter time needed by nurses for the detection of vital signs and clinical parameters, and possibility to dedicate to high‐quality activities Therefore the present study aims to provide data regarding the impact of a specific and oriented integrated remote system for the monitoring of vital status of critically ill patients in the improvement of outcomes and in a more efficient prevision of length of stay and costs, and to verify whether the regular use of a wireless remote monitoring system could improve the quality of the assistance and reduce major complications vs. a traditional monitoring of clinical status executed by the nursing staff, in two specific settings of critically ill patients referring to Internal Medicine with acute conditions: GROUP A: Patients who undergo a transition to a subacute intensive care unit, in terms of reduction of re‐exacerbation, re‐access to emergency department or need of intervention by Internal Medicine unit specialists by the use of wireless monitoring vs. traditional monitoring. GROUP B: Patients who are selected for an earlier discharge from Internal Medicine Unit, in terms of non‐inferiority in the incidence of major clinical complications.

AB: Background: About one‐third of people older than 65 years fall at least once a year. Physical exercise has been previously demonstrated to improve gait, enhance physical fitness, and prevent falls. Nonetheless, the addition of cognitive training components may potentially increase these effects, since cognitive impairment is related to gait irregularities and fall risk. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive‐physical training would lead to greater improvements in dual‐task (DT) gait compared to exclusive physical training. Methods: Elderly persons older than 70 years and without cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1‐hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Gait variables, functional fitness (Short Physical Performance Battery, 6‐minute walk), and fall frequencies were assessed at baseline, after 3 months and 6 months, and at 1‐year follow‐up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were carried out. Results: Eighty‐nine participants were randomized to three groups initially; 71 completed the training and 47 were available at 1‐year follow‐up. DANCE/MEMORY showed a significant advantage compared to PHYS in DT costs of step time variability at fast walking (P=0.044). Training‐specific gait adaptations were found on comparing DANCE and MEMORY: DANCE reduced step time at fast walking (P=0.007) and MEMORY reduced gait variability in DT and DT costs at preferred walking speed (both trend P=0.062). Global linear time effects showed improved gait (P<0.05), functional fitness (P<0.05), and reduced fall frequency (‐77%, P<0.001). Only single‐task fast walking, gait variability at preferred walking speed, and Short Physical Performance Battery were reduced at follow‐up (all P<0.05 or trend). Conclusion: Long‐term multicomponent cognitive‐physical and exclusive physical training programs demonstrated similar potential to counteract age‐related decline in physical functioning.

AB: BACKGROUND: The Dutch government, hospitals, and health insurance companies have agreed on concentrating all specialist care in a few expert centers. This should lead to lower healthcare costs, but might also cause less accessible healthcare for patients living at a considerable distance from expert centers. A way to overcome less accessible healthcare, while maintaining reduced costs of medical care, is by using telemedicine between physician and patient. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, follow‐up consultation between the patient and physician via a secured real‐time video connection 6 weeks after plastic surgery of the face was compared to traditional in‐person consultation after the same time interval. After the consultation, patients received an invite to fill in an online survey, which consisted of questionnaires assessing patient satisfaction (PSQ‐18, TSQ) and communication experiences (PEQ), as well as questions about the time spent on different aspects of the consultations. RESULTS: Thirty‐one patients participated. Overall satisfaction was equal for both groups, but a significant difference in the dimensions 'general satisfaction' (online consultation group more satisfied) and 'accessibility and convenience' (online consultation group less satisfied) was found. Patients reported significantly lower satisfaction in patient‐physician communication in online consultation than in traditional in‐person consultations. Patients were satisfied with the online consultation, and were willing to use the system again. Patients in the online consultation group experienced significantly less waiting time, and spent less time in total for the appointment. CONCLUSIONS: Overall patients are equally satisfied with traditional consultation or real‐time video consultation in plastic surgery. Online consultation is found to be a time‐saving alternative to traditional consultation. However, online consultation is perceived by some patients as a negative influence on communication with the physician. Dedicated training for physicians in the use of online consultation is recommended to improve their online communicative skills.

AB: Background Nonadherence, inadequate monitoring, and side‐effects result in suboptimal outcomes in ulcerative colitis (UC). We hypothesize that telemanagement for UC will improve symptoms, quality of life, adherence, and decrease costs. Purpose This article describes the challenges encountered in the design of the home telemanagement in patients with UC trial. Methods In a randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of telemanagement for UC compared to best available care, 100 patients will be enrolled. Subjects in the intervention arm will complete self‐testing with telemanagement weekly; best available care subjects will receive scheduled follow up, educational fact sheets, and written action plans. Telemanagement consists of a home‐unit, decision support server, and web‐based clinician portal. The home‐unit includes a scale and laptop. Subjects will respond to questions about symptoms, side‐effects, adherence, and knowledge weekly; subjects will receive action plans after self‐testing. Outcome variables to be assessed every 4 months include: disease activity, using the Seo index; quality of life, using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire; adherence, using pharmacy refill data and the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale; utilization of healthcare resources, using urgent care visits and hospitalizations. Results We encountered several challenges during design and implementation of our trial. First, we selected a randomized controlled trial design. We could have selected a quasiexperimental design to decrease the sample size needed and costs. Second, identification of a control group was challenging. Telemanagement patients received self‐care plans and an educational curriculum. Since controls would not receive these interventions, we thought our results would be biased in favor of telemanagement. In addition, we wanted to evaluate the mode of delivery of these components of care. Therefore, we included written action plans and educational materials for patients in the control group ('best available care'). Third, we could not blind subjects to group assignment. In an attempt to decrease bias, staff was masked to group assignment to decrease measurement bias. Fourth, we selected outcome measures that were not invasive to decrease risks to subjects and to enhance recruitment. Limitations Our results may not be generalizable as our program is a tertiary center. Further, subjects are not blinded to the intervention potentially resulting in bias; we attempt to minimize this bias by having staff masked to treatment group at the time of assessment of outcome measures. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, our trial will be the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate telemedicine in subjects with gastrointestinal disease. We describe several issues encountered in design and implementation of our trial that will aid investigators when planning telemedicine trials in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI: Telehealth Management in HF Disparity Patients
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02196922
YR: 2014
KY: Heart Failure
AB: Disparities in cardiovascular disease have received particular focus, as cardiovascular disease is a major contributor to differences in morbidity and mortality between blacks and whites. African Americans, for example, are hospitalized for chronic heart failure (CHF) at a higher rate than whites and are 30% more likely to die from CHF than white individuals. Community‐dwelling patients with CHF typically receive exacerbation‐focused care, leading to high rates of emergency department (ED) and hospital utilization. The lack of comprehensive chronic disease management leads to poor patient outcomes, and increased health care costs. Given the larger burden of CHF and the unfavorable disease outcomes in disparity communities, a tailored and more focused management of this clinical condition is warranted. We propose to: 1. Assess telehealth self management (TSM) usability, utilizing a mixed‐methods approach, focusing on patient and stakeholder input, with the goal of adapting the intervention to facilitate acceptability and feasibility in a population of low‐income ethnic minority patients. Prior to intervention implementation, we will determine characteristics of the intervention requiring adaptation to maximize usability through focus groups, with key community stakeholders, patients and caregivers. We will continue the qualitative usability assessment during the intervention with patients enrolled in the study to identify barriers/challenges to usability, to further adapt the intervention. Finally, we will use quantitative methods to assess usability. These quantitative indicators will also be used to make adjustments and inform future wide‐scale interventions that will be conducted in this community. 2. Compare hospital utilization of low income ethnic minority patients receiving telehealth technology vs. demographically matched patients receiving standard of care. A randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted to test the primary hypothesis that health care utilization will be lower in the in the TSM group than the usual‐care group. We will specifically compare acute care and ED utilization and quality of life (Minnesota QoL Questionnaire) between groups. We will adjust for potential confounders (demographic, clinical, educational and functional/support variables). The target population is community‐dwelling CHF patients discharged home from the Nassau University Medical Center. This research will further our understanding of the use of TSM in the management of CHF for low income, ethnic minority seniors. The proposed research will improve patient outcomes while reducing unnecessary hospitalizations and ED burden. Chronic disease self‐management programs have the potential to reduce health care costs while improving patient health status, particularly for medically underserved communities.

AB: BACKGROUND: About one‐third of people older than 65 years fall at least once a year. Physical exercise has been previously demonstrated to improve gait, enhance physical fitness, and prevent falls. Nonetheless, the addition of cognitive training components may potentially increase these effects, since cognitive impairment is related to gait irregularities and fall risk. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive‐physical training would lead to greater improvements in dual‐task (DT) gait compared to exclusive physical training. METHODS: Elderly persons older than 70 years and without cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to the following groups: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1‐hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Gait variables, functional fitness (Short Physical Performance Battery, 6‐minute walk), and fall frequencies were assessed at baseline, after 3 months and 6 months, and at 1‐year follow‐up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were carried out. RESULTS: Eighty‐nine participants were randomized to three groups initially; 71 completed the training and 47 were available at 1‐year follow‐up. DANCE/MEMORY showed a significant advantage compared to PHYS in DT costs of step time variability at fast walking (P=0.044). Training‐specific gait adaptations were found on comparing DANCE and MEMORY: DANCE reduced step time at fast walking (P=0.007) and MEMORY reduced gait variability in DT and DT costs at preferred walking speed (both trend P=0.062). Global linear time effects showed improved gait (P<0.05), functional fitness (P<0.05), and reduced fall frequency (‐77%, P<0.001). Only single‐task fast walking, gait variability at preferred walking speed, and Short Physical Performance Battery were reduced at follow‐up (all P<0.05 or trend). CONCLUSION: Long‐term multicomponent cognitive‐physical and exclusive physical training programs demonstrated similar potential to counteract age‐related decline in physical functioning.

AB: Telemonitoring has been suggested to have potential benefits in patients with cirrhosis. However, to date, no prospective studies exist to support this idea. Hence, the investigators study would like to explore the use of home telemonitoring devices with vital sign capturing capabilities in recently‐discharged patients with cirrhosis to decrease 30‐day readmissions, mortality and costs. This is prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing two strategies of post‐discharged care in patients with cirrhosis‐related hospitalizations. First treatment arm will incorporate the Vivify home monitoring device into post hospital care.Home monitoring kits include a tablet with wireless internet and vital sign monitoring capabilities (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, weight and pulse oximetry if needed) and the device has the ability to trigger an alert to the "liver care coordinator." Second treatment arm will continue the standard of care therapy that all post‐ hospitalized patients receive upon discharge, i.e. return to clinic appointments, education regarding any signs or worsening symptoms to watch for, as well as contact numbers to connect with their doctor or nurse.

AB: Introduction: Respir@dom is an innovative French telemedicine project that combines the automatic transmission of CPAP data with an internet based support programme. Respir@dom aims to improve patient observance by combining improved education and support with continually updated data, accessible to both the patient and his health care team, on machine use and patient satisfaction. Materials and methods: The Respir@dom platform was developed to harness the power of social media in improving patient education and autonomy. The site acts as a source of high quality information on sleep apnea. This information is accessible to all site visitors. Information is presented not only as text but also in the form of a serious game, in which players learn key messages about sleep apnea and treatment. The site also presents information dedicated to users of continual positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines with videos demonstrating key competences (ex. cleaning a humidificator). Patients can participate in the Respir@dom community, which enables them to exchange information, participate in the forums, create blogs and complete their secure online medical record in which they monitor sleepiness, satisfaction and motivation with their CPAP. Patients randomized to telemonitoring can also access the information automatically transmitted by their CPAP via GPRS in graphic form. An inbuilt algorithm generates alerts which remind the patient to adjust his mask in case of leaks or to increase nightly use. These electronically generated alerts are also transmitted via the medical record to the health care team contact the patient with suggestions if the difficulty continues. Results: The Respiradom site http://respiradom.fr, including the serious game, has been created and the community is growing. A cost‐efficiency study is underway. 200 patients will be included of whom half will be randomised to telemonitoring and half to normal treatment. Both groups of patients will have access to the Respir@‐ dom site, but only patients randomized to telemonitoring will receive continual monitoring of CPAP indicators and alerts, thus enabling the study to determine which of the elements (site + community vs. telemonitoring) is responsible for changes in CPAP use. Conclusion: Respir@dom offers a new approach to improving care of patients treated by CPAP.

AB: Background: Evidence is needed to determine the role of telehealth (TH) in COPD management. Methods: PROMETE II was a multicentre, randomized, 12‐month trial. Severe COPD patients in stable condition were randomized to a specific monitoring protocol with TH or routine clinical practice (RCP). The primary objective was to reduce the number of COPD exacerbations leading to ER visits/hospital admissions between groups. Results: Overall, 237 COPD patients were screened, and 229 (96.6%) were randomized to TH (n = 115) or RCP (n = 114), with age of 71 +/‐ 8 years and 80% were men. Overall, 169 completed the full follow‐up period. There were no statistical differences at one year between groups in the proportion of participants who had a COPD exacerbation (60% in TH vs. 53.5% in RCP; p = 0.321). There was, however, a marked but non‐significant trend towards a shorter duration of hospitalization and days in ICU in the TH group (18.9 +/‐ 16.0 and 6.0 +/‐ 4.6 days) compared to the RCP group (22.4 +/‐ 19.5 and 13.3 +/‐ 11.1 days). The number of all‐cause deaths was comparable between groups (12 in TH vs. 13 in RCP) as was total resource utilization cost (7912 in TH vs. 8918 in RCP). Telehealth was evaluated highly positively by patients and doctors. Conclusions: Remote patient management did not reduce COPD‐related ER visits or hospital admissions compared to RCP within 12 months. Copyright © 2018

AB: Purpose: Although self‐measurement of home blood pressure (HBP) is common in Japan and HBP telemonitoring via the Internet is possible, whether telemonitoring improves HBP control better than conventional practice remains unclear. Furthermore, hypertension care with online communication using telemonitored HBP is feasible, whereas the efficacy and safety of such telemedicine have not been established. We aim to compare traditional care, care with office visits using HBP telemonitoring, and antihypertensive telemedicine based on HBP telemonitoring. Methods and design: In total, 444 patients with uncontrolled hypertension will be recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: (1) control: usual care with office visits and HBP self‐report, (2) telemonitoring: weekly assessment of transmitted HBP by physicians and treatment adjustment upon office visits, or (3) telemedicine: online communication instead of office visits to adjust medication using telemonitored HBP. Primary outcome is the time to control of HBP, and secondary outcomes include achieved HBP levels, adherence, treatment intensity, adverse events, patient satisfaction and cost‐effectiveness. Discussion: Hypertension care with telemonitoring and telemedicine are expected to require shorter time to achieve HBP control compared to usual care. Combining HBP telemonitoring with telemedicine may lower the hurdles for starting and persisting to hypertension treatment and eventually reduce cardiovascular events. Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

AB: Improving Self‐Management of Exercise After Lung Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY Lung transplantation is a costly procedure. Estimated costs, from 30 days prior to transplant to 6 months post‐surgery, exceed $1 million per patient and routine medical management costs $50,000 per year thereafter. Despite this extensive investment, major challenges remain. Prior to transplant, lung transplant recipients (LTR) self restrict activity due to severe ventilatory limitation, resulting in reduced muscle mass and qualitative changes in large exercising skeletal muscles. After transplant, despite improved lung function, prior studies consistently report LTR fail to reach predicted physical function or physical activity. Further, nearly 70% of LTR are at risk of developing hypertension within first 5 years due to the participants immunosuppressive regimen and an inactive lifestyle can worsen this risk. Consequently, full benefits of transplant may not be achieved. Few studies have tested ways to engage LTR to self‐manage exercise and adopt an active lifestyle. Initiated by an Early Stage New Investigator, the investigators propose to test Lung Transplant Go (LTGO), a behavioral exercise intervention that provides individualized exercise training integrated with behavioral coaching for LTR in the participants home. Exercise training will focus on assisting LTR to learn and practice exercises to reverse muscle deconditioning. Behavioral coaching will engage LTR in developing skills to self‐manage physical activity in the participants daily life and maintain this as a sustained habit using strategies that include incremental goal setting, self‐monitoring and feedback and problem solving. The LTGO intervention consists of two phases: Phase 1. Intensive home‐based exercise training and behavioral coaching via a telerehabilitation platform,Versatile and Integrated System for Tele‐Rehabilitation (VISYTER). Interactive intervention sessions will be delivered to the home via real time video conferencing (10 sessions within 12 weeks); and Phase 2. Transition to selfmanagement. Four telephone sessions (1 behavioral contract + 3 monthly counseling sessions) will be delivered over 12 weeks to provide behavioral coaching and exercise reinforcement. The investigators pilot work successfully demonstrated the feasibility, safety and ability of LTGO to improve physical function and physical activity and was enthusiastically received. The investigators will conduct a two‐group randomized controlled trial comparing LTGO against enhanced usual care (EUC). Participants will be 112 LTR randomized to LTGO or EUC (1:1). Outcomes will be measured at baseline, and 3 and 6 months post‐randomization. Primary outcomes are physical function (walking ability 6 Minute Walk Test) (6MWT), balance (Berg Balance Scale), lower body strength (30 Second Chair. Stand Test], and quadriceps muscle strength [Biodex System 3 Pro]) and physical activity (Actigraph GT3X). Secondary outcome is blood pressure control (preventing onset of hypertension or controlling existing hypertension). Potential mediators will be exercise self‐efficacy and self‐monitoring using the a hand device to measure the participants walking steps. Potential moderators will be sex and clinical factors (symptoms, pre‐and post‐transplant clinical data). Findings will provide evidence regarding efficacy of the LTGO as a means to improve exercise self‐management in LTR and, potentially, benefit in individuals living with other complex chronic conditions.

AB: It is intuitive that postdischarge surgical complications are associated with increased patient dissatisfaction, and are directly associated with an increase in medical expenditures. It is also easy to make the connection that many post‐hospital discharge surgical complications, including surgical site infections (SSIs), could be influenced or exacerbated by patient comorbidities. The authors of a recent study reported that female gender, obesity, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, and neurologic disease were significant predictors of SSIs after vascular reconstruction was performed. The main concern for optimal patient care, especially in geographically isolated areas of West Virginia, is to have early, expeditious, and prompt diagnosis of complications and SSI. This adjunct to existing approaches could lead to improved outcomes and patient satisfaction, minimizing third‐party interventions and decreasing the total cost of care. It seems reasonable to believe that monitoring using telehealth technology and managing the general health care of patients after a hospital vascular intervention will improve overall health and reduce 30‐day readmissions and SSIs.

AB: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among Veterans is a condition that imparts a great burden to the patient in terms of serious co‐morbidities and results in a great cost to the VA Health Care System to treat the co‐morbidities, which include heart disease, stroke and neuropsychiatric disorders. Positive airway pressure (PAP) is used to treat sleep apnea and studies have shown a poor adherence to treatment. The investigators hypothesize that using wireless technology will lead to early detection of problems of treatment use and will translate into early remedial action which will improve the use and effectiveness of treatment. The investigators will compare two methods. Usual care involves downloading data from PAP machines at designated 3‐month intervals, requiring a face‐to‐face clinician visit. Wireless care involved more frequent monitoring and intervention in the event of anomalies in treatment use or effectiveness.

AB: We describe a randomized controlled trial, the Lakota Oyate Wicozani Pi Kte (LOWPK) trial, which was designed to determine whether a Web‐based diabetes and nutritional intervention can improve risk factors related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) among a group of remote reservation‐dwelling adult American Indian men and women with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for CVD. Enrollment on a rolling basis of 180 planned participants began during 2009; an average 18‐month follow‐up was completed by June 2011. The primary outcome variable is change in glycosylated hemoglobin level after an average 18‐month follow‐up period. Secondary outcome variables include changes in low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, and smoking status, as well as an evaluation of intervention cost‐effectiveness. If effective, the LOWPK trial may serve as a guide for future chronic disease intervention trials in remote, technologically challenged settings.

AB: Objective: The aim of the present study was to improve the health care of people repeatedly admitted to private hospitals. Method: An open trial in which frequent utilizers were offered telephone case management over a 12 month period, was conducted. Results: An average of 24 phone calls were made to the 99 who remained in the programme for the 12 months. Psychological distress declined significantly over the 12 months, and the number of days in hospital was reduced compared to the previous year. The cost benefit ratio was 1:8.4. Conclusions: The changes in well‐being and hospitalization over the 12 months were substantial and are unlikely to be due to regression to the mean. A prospective randomized controlled trial comparing telephone case management with treatment as usual is indicated.

AB: Disruptive behaviors such as self‐injury, aggression, and property destruction pose significant health‐related issues to children diagnosed with fragile X syndrome (FXS), impacting the child's quality of life and causing significant distress to families. Access to appropriate treatment for families is severely limited by factors such as cost of care, shortages of qualified treatment providers, and geographic spread of children with FXS across the country. To address these potential issues, the effectiveness of administering a standardized function‐based behavioral treatment for problem behaviors in FXS will be evaluated using telemedicine. The proposed study intervention therefore offers a tremendous step forward in clinical research both in the field of FXS and in the field of developmental disabilities more broadly, and thus will have a significant impact on public health.

AB: This study aims to evaluate a culturally appropriate, low cost and sustainable management plan for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Various randomized controlled trials confirmed that T2DM can be delayed with lifestyle intervention and programmes which promote improvements in diet, increased physical activity and weight loss. Translation of lifestyle intervention to real‐life settings however remains a major challenge. The investigators therefore propose a diabetes management trial for T2DM patients using telemedicine. This project's innovations include the use of information technology to deliver messages to the physicians while similarly involving family members of diabetics to manage the patient's condition collectively. This creates a sense of well‐being, empowering the individual as well as the community to be responsible for their own health and well‐being

AB: Poor treatment adherence with CPAP therapy is well‐documented. Set against a backdrop of telemedicine applications that have grown as fast in unsubstantiated claims and assumptions of patient satisfaction, diagnostic accuracy, clinical efficacy, and cost‐effectiveness as they have in technological sophistication and capabilities, the evaluative aspect of this proposal is designed as as a randomized, controlled clinical trial—Usual Care patients (control) versus i‐PAP patients (intervention). An important empirical‐methodological advantage of the project is the objective measurement of CPAP adherence, which is measured by internal microprocessor as the "amount of time CPAP is used at the prescribed pressure." This objective measurement allows feedback of treatment adherence and efficacy to both patient and provider, and the i‐PAP intervention was designed around this central feature.

AB: BACKGROUND: Technology in healthcare takes many forms and is growing rapidly. Few studies have considered the acceptability, benefits, and barriers perceived by clients involved in the use of technology. The purpose of this study was to discover perceptions about ease of use, efficacy, and difficulties encountered by patients who used an in‐home telehealth communication device, the Health Buddy. METHODS: Thirteen participants were selected from a parent study in which they used the Health Buddy. Focus groups and individual interviews were the data collection methods. Content analysis was used to answer the research questions. RESULTS: Participants found that the Health Buddy is technologically easy to use; that it promoted, taught, and supported heart failure self‐management; and that it was even a "lifesaver," but that it could be bothersome, complex, and too lengthy an intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth, a cost‐effective way to promote improved health management, is suitable to most patients. Minor adjustments in management will be needed to accommodate individual preferences to increase satisfaction.

AB: This study examines emotional disclosure through the activity of journaling as a means of coping with maternal stress associated with parenting a child with disruptive behaviors. Through a randomized control and pre‐test post‐test study design of an online journal writing intervention, change to maternal stress and quality of mother‐child relationship for children with ASD, ADHD and SPD was addressed. Behavioral symptoms were found to be the primary source of parenting stress for mothers and a significant relationship between child characteristics and maternal stress was identified. Emotional disclosure through the online journal writing program (especially in the presence of high disclosure of negative emotions) was shown to reduce maternal stress and improve the quality of mother‐child relationship. These findings suggest cost‐effective telehealth interventions may support maternal health. Important clinical implications are discussed.

TI: Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy (ART) for Rural Veteran Smokers
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct01723163
YR: 2012
AB: The addition of contingency management (CM) to existing evidenced‐based tele‐health smoking cessation interventions is expected to be a cost‐effective way to increase the reach of intensive smoking cessation treatment. CM is an intensive behavioral therapy that provides positive reinforcers (e.g., money, vouchers) to individuals misusing substances contingent upon objective evidence of abstinence from drug use. Implementation of CM has been limited because of the need to verify abstinence multiple times daily with a clinic based carbon monoxide (CO) monitor. As a result, CM approaches have largely been relegated to inpatient and day treatment programs. The application of emerging smart‐phone technology, however, can overcome this barrier. Investigators have developed a smart‐phone application which allows a participant to video themselves several times daily while using a small CO monitor and to transmit the data to a secure server. This innovation has made the use of CM for outpatient smoking cessation portable and feasible, i.e., mobile CM (mCM). Thus, the primary goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined tele‐health and CM intervention that investigators are calling Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy (ART). Proposed is a comparative effectiveness trial with a two‐group design in which 300 Veteran smokers will be randomized to either: ABSTINENCE REINFORCEMENT THERAPY (ART) a proactive tele‐health intervention that combines guideline based cognitive‐behavioral telephone counseling (TC), a tele‐medicine clinic for access to nicotine replacement (NRT), and intensive behavioral therapy through mobile contingency management. TELE‐HEALTH FOR SMOKING CESSATION a proactive tele‐health intervention that will provide controls for therapist, medication, time and attention effects. The tele‐health intervention provides the same guideline based cognitive‐behavioral smoking cessation telephone counseling (TC), and tele‐medicine clinic for access to NRT as in the ART intervention. Both of the proposed interventions are designed in accordance with national smoking cessation guidelines. Tele‐health smoking cessation interventions are typically less intensive than clinic based specialty care, but increase reach of services through bypassing barriers to participation such as geographical distance from VA care. The addition of mCM to an evidence‐based tele‐health smoking intervention will significantly increase the intensity of the intervention and is predicted to increase efficacy. If cessation programs are to have significant impact (Impact = Reach X Efficacy) 4 on changing health behavior at the population level, investigators must identify new and innovative strategies to increase treatment intensity, access, and participation. Specific aims are to: AIM 1: Evaluate the impact of ART on rates of abstinence from cigarettes as measured by bio‐verified, self‐reported prolonged abstinence at 3‐month, 6‐month, and 12 month post‐randomization follow‐ups. Hypothesis 1: Abstinence rates will be significantly higher among Veterans randomized to the ART‐based intervention than those randomized to the Tele‐health alone intervention (primary end‐point; self‐reported and bio‐verified prolonged abstinence at the 6‐month follow‐up) AIM 2: Evaluate the relative cost‐effectiveness of the ART intervention in quality adjusted life years (QALY). Hypothesis 2: ART based treatment will result in greater cost‐effectiveness compared to the control condition as measured by the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio. AIM 3: Evaluate potential treatment mediators including self‐efficacy‐related mechanisms. Hypothesis 3: Increased abstinence associated with ART will be partially mediated by increased self‐efficacy compared to the contact‐control condition. Supplementary AIM: To evaluate the impact of psychiatric (i.e., PTSD, depression, alcohol abuse) and pain symptoms on treatment outcome across the two conditions.

AB: This is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate non‐inferiority of Prolonged Exposure (PE) delivered via home‐based telehealth (HBT) compared to standard in‐person (IP) PE. One‐hundred thirty two Veterans recruited from a Southeastern Veterans Affairs Medical Center and affiliated University who met criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were randomized to receive PE via HBT or PE via IP. Results indicated that PE‐HBT was non‐inferior to PE‐IP in terms of reducing PTSD scores at post‐treatment, 3 and 6 month follow‐up. However, non‐inferiority hypotheses for depression were only supported at 6 month follow‐up. HBT has great potential to reduce patient burden associated with receiving treatment in terms of travel time, travel cost, lost work, and stigma without sacrificing efficacy. These findings indicate that telehealth treatment delivered directly into patients' homes may dramatically increase the reach of this evidence‐based therapy for PTSD without diminishing effectiveness.

AB: We studied the patient experience of a telephone booster intervention, i.e. weekly reinforcement of the clinic advice regarding lifestyle modification advice to support weight loss. Forty six adults with Type 2 diabetes and a body mass index >28 kg/m(2) were randomised into either intervention (n = 25) or control (n = 21) groups. Semi‐structured interviews were conducted with the intervention group participants to explore their views and experiences. The patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the telephone calls and most would recommend the intervention to others in a similar situation. The content of the telephone follow‐up met their need for on‐going support. The benefits arising from the telephone calls included: being reminded to comply with their regimen; prompting and motivating adherence to diabetes self‐care behaviours; improved self‐esteem; and feeling 'worthy of interest'. The convenience and low cost of telephone support has much potential in chronic disease management.

AB: Background: Approximately one third of cancer survivors experience persistent clinically significant distress [1], and unmet psychological needs in Australian cancer patients are highly prevalent [2]. The Internet presents a potentially feasible method of delivery for psychological care, at a minimal cost and with high community accessibility. Aim: This two‐phased project will develop and trial an innovative Internetbased psychological intervention for distressed cancer patients and assess the efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of this intervention. Methods: In the developmental phase we will adapt an existing manualised tele‐based and evidence‐based cognitive behavioural intervention to a webbased platform; which will be tested for usability, acceptability and user satisfaction in high distress cancer patients. In the second phase we will conduct a large scale randomised controlled trial with 490 newly diagnosed melanoma and colorectal cancer patients identified as having high distress or at risk of high distress. Participants will be randomised to 1) a static patient education website or, 2) an individualised web‐delivered cognitive behavioural intervention‐CancerCope. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 2, 6 and 12 months after recruitment. Results: This presentation will provide an overview of the development and testing of CancerCope. In the second phase, it is anticipated that participants who receive access to CancerCope will experience significantly less anxiety and depression; less cancer specific distress; lower unmet psychological supportive care needs; higher positive adjustment and improved quality of life compared to participants who receive access to the static patient education website. Conclusions: There is a clinical imperative to provide accessible evidencebased psychosocial therapies to cancer patients in the acute health care system, and as they progress through survivorship. This project will provide recommendations on the efficacy and potential economic value of a webbased psychological intervention to promote optimal mental health for people living with cancer.

SNF staff will place a formal order for psychiatric consultation to the study so that the participants can receive psychiatric care via ATP or STP. Research assistants will screen each referral by reviewing inclusion and exclusion criteria based on the psychiatric referral question. To closely match real‐world practice settings, STP "clinic" will be pre‐scheduled for 4 hours once per month for each site. ATP participants will be interviewed by SNF staff (and videotaped with assistance from research assistant within 5 days). The video will then by reviewed by research psychiatrist and a consultation report will be send to the PCP in <5 days. Follow‐up will occur at 1‐, 2‐, 3‐, 6‐ and 12‐month time periods, in addition to the baseline (0‐month) visit for a total of 6 consults. Aim 1: To assess whether ATP and STP models improve clinical outcomes: Hypotheses: Compared to STP, the ATP arm will: H1: show non‐inferior clinical outcome trajectory, reflected in improvement from baseline, as measured by Clinical Global Impression (CGI). Aim 2: To assess the acceptability of ATP and STP by examining satisfaction surveys from SNF residents (who are able to complete the surveys). Hypothesis: Compared to STP, ATP participants will show: H1: Similar levels of satisfaction as measured by the Telemedicine Satisfaction Survey as completed by participants. Aim 3: To conduct healthcare economics and net benefit analysis of cost‐effectiveness of ATP vs. STP in SNFs. H3: ATP, compared to STP, will be more cost effective with respect to SNF resident satisfaction and reduced wait times.

AB: Background and aims: Coronary artery bypass graft is a major surgery and has complications that require professional and long term follow‐up and nursing care that if do not properly handled, could reduce the quality of life and increase post‐operative complications. On the other hand Tele‐nursing is a cost‐effective way to educate and follow‐up of patients. This study aimed to assess the impact of Tele‐nursing on adherence to treatment plan in discharged patients after coronary artery bypass graft. Materials and methods: A quasi‐experimental study was carried out at Ekbatan Therapeutic and Educational Center of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences at Hamadan, Iran, in 2013. In this study, 71 patients who had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery and had inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two experimental group (n= 36), and control group (n= 35). They completed questionnaire before discharging from Therapeutic and Educational Center. In the experimental group on days 2, 4, 7, second week (day 11), third week (day 18) and fourth week (day 25) after discharge, follow‐up interventions and nursing education with Tele‐nursing was done, but in the in the control groups, patients received only routine interventions. After completion of the intervention period, both groups completed the questionnaire and the results were compared. Results: Adherence of treatment plan in both groups did not have significant difference before intervention (P= 0.696), but had a significant difference with regard to baseline after intervention in aromatherapy group (P< 0.01) and with control group after intervention (P< 0.01). Adherence to treatment plan in the aromatherapy group was better in compared to control group (P< 0.01). Conclusion: Tele‐nursing is a convenient way, cost effective training and follow‐up care for patients after coronary artery bypass surgery, which can improve patients' adherence to treatment plan in developing countries such as Iran.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Pre‐anesthesia evaluation allows discovery of conditions affecting perioperative planning, but when inadequate it may be associated with delays, cancellations, and preventable adverse events. Not all patients who could benefit will keep appointments. Telemedicine pre‐anesthesia evaluation may provide for safe patient care while reducing patient inconvenience and cost. Herein we investigate the impact of telemedicine pre‐anesthesia evaluation on perioperative processes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a single‐center prospective randomized trial in 200 adults scheduled for head and neck surgery at Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda, CA. Consenting patients not meeting criteria for telephone pre‐anesthesia evaluation were randomly assigned to the in‐person or telemedicine group. The primary outcome measure was inadequate evaluation caused surgical delay or cancellation. Secondary measures included prediction of difficult airway management and concordance of physical examination. RESULTS: After consent, 40 patients met criteria for telephone screening. Five patients canceled surgery, none for inadequate pre‐anesthesia evaluation; thus 155 were randomized. Delay occurred in 1 telemedicine patient awaiting results performed outside our system. Missing documentation at the time of the visit was less common for telemedicine. Difficult airway management was predicted equally but had low positive predictive value. Heart and lung examinations were highly concordant with day of surgery documentation. Patients and providers were highly satisfied with both evaluation modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine and in‐person evaluations were equivalent, with high patient and provider satisfaction. Telemedicine provides potential patient time and cost saving benefits without more day of surgery delay in our system. A prospective trial of patients from multiple surgical specialty clinics is warranted.

AB: Background: It has been demonstrated that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has a moderate effect on symptom reduction and on general well being of patients suffering from psychosis. However, questions regarding the specific efficacy of CBT, the treatment safety, the cost‐effectiveness, and the moderators and mediators of treatment effects are still a major issue. The major objective of this trial is to investigate whether CBT is specifically efficacious in reducing positive symptoms when compared with non‐specific supportive therapy (ST) which does not implement CBT‐techniques but provides comparable therapeutic attention.Methods/Design: The POSITIVE study is a multicenter, prospective, single‐blind, parallel group, randomised clinical trial, comparing CBT and ST with respect to the efficacy in reducing positive symptoms in psychotic disorders. CBT as well as ST consist of 20 sessions altogether, 165 participants receiving CBT and 165 participants receiving ST. Major methodological aspects of the study are systematic recruitment, explicit inclusion criteria, reliability checks of assessments with control for rater shift, analysis by intention to treat, data management using remote data entry, measures of quality assurance (e.g. on‐site monitoring with source data verification, regular query process), advanced statistical analysis, manualized treatment, checks of adherence and competence of therapists.Research relating the psychotherapy process with outcome, neurobiological research addressing basic questions of delusion formation using fMRI and neuropsychological assessment and treatment research investigating adaptations of CBT for adolescents is combined in this network. Problems of transfer into routine clinical care will be identified and addressed by a project focusing on cost efficiency.Discussion: This clinical trial is part of efforts to intensify psychotherapy research in the field of psychosis in Germany, to contribute to the international discussion on psychotherapy in psychotic disorders, and to help implement psychotherapy in routine care. Furthermore, the study will allow drawing conclusions about the mediators of treatment effects of CBT of psychotic disorders.Trial Registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN29242879. 2010 Klingberg et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB: BACKGROUND: Comparative effectiveness research (CER) evidence on childhood obesity provides the basis for effective screening and management strategies in pediatric primary care. The uses of health information technology including decision support tools in the electronic health records (EHRs), as well as remote and mobile support to families, offer the potential to accelerate the adoption of childhood obesity CER evidence. METHODS/DESIGN: The Study of Technology to Accelerate Research (STAR) is a three‐arm, cluster‐randomized controlled trial being conducted in 14 pediatric offices in Massachusetts designed to enroll 800, 6 to 12 year old children with a body mass index (BMI)≥ 95th percentile seen in primary care at those practices. We will examine the extent to which computerized decision support tools in the EHR delivered to primary care providers at the point of care, with or without direct‐to‐parent support and coaching, will increase adoption of CER evidence for management of obese children. Direct‐to‐parent intervention components include telephone coaching and twice‐weekly text messages. Point‐of‐care outcomes include obesity diagnosis, nutrition and physical activity counseling, and referral to weight management. One‐year child‐level outcomes include changes in BMI and improvements in diet, physical activity, screen time, and sleep behaviors, as well as cost and cost‐effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: STAR will determine the extent to which decision support tools in EHRs with or without direct‐to‐parent support will increase adoption of evidence‐based obesity management strategies in pediatric practice and improve childhood obesity‐related outcomes.

AB: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the remote introduction of electronic decision support tools into family practices improves risk factor control after first stroke. This study also aimed to develop methods to implement cluster randomized trials in stroke using electronic health records. METHODS: Family practices were recruited from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and allocated to intervention and control trial arms by minimization. Remotely installed, electronic decision support tools promoted intensified secondary prevention for 12 months with last measure of systolic blood pressure as the primary outcome. Outcome data from electronic health records were analyzed using marginal models. RESULTS: There were 106 Clinical Practice Research Datalink family practices allocated (intervention, 53; control, 53), with 11 391 (control, 5516; intervention, 5875) participants with acute stroke ever diagnosed. Participants at trial practices had similar characteristics as 47,887 patients with stroke at nontrial practices. During the intervention period, blood pressure values were recorded in the electronic health records for 90% and cholesterol values for 84% of participants. After intervention, the latest mean systolic blood pressure was 131.7 (SD, 16.8) mm Hg in the control trial arm and 131.4 (16.7) mm Hg in the intervention trial arm, and adjusted mean difference was ‐0.56 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, ‐1.38 to 0.26; P=0.183). The financial cost of the trial was approximately US $22 per participant, or US $2400 per family practice allocated. CONCLUSIONS: Large pragmatic intervention studies may be implemented at low cost by using electronic health records. The intervention used in this trial was not found to be effective, and further research is needed to develop more effective intervention strategies.

AB: Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation programs improve dyspnea and health status associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but benefits wane when patients return to a sedentary lifestyle. This study tested a simple, low‐resource, low‐cost home walking program. Methods: In this single center, 3‐month study, 115 COPD patients were randomized to a control cohort or a goal setting cohort. Each patient met with study staff and received 5 telephone calls at 2‐week intervals. During these contacts, the Goal group was assisted by a wellness coach who helped them set personal activity goals. All patients wore a pedometer to record daily steps, the primary study outcome. Results: Over the 12‐week interval, the average step‐per‐days was 36% higher for the Goal cohort patients (Week 12 mean = 4390) than for Control patients (mean = 3790). No group differences emerged on the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, the COPD Assessment Test, or the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire. Secondary analyses indicated that even patients with greater disease severity, including those with an mMRC score >2 or forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) % predicted below 50%, increased their walking relative to Control patients. Almost half (48%) of Goal patients successfully reached at least one personal goal such as increasing stamina and activity, or decreasing shortness of breath or weight. Conclusions: A relatively low‐resource wellness coaching, goal‐setting intervention resulted in a small improvement in the activity level of COPD patients over a 12‐week period including those with marked pulmonary impairment. Further investigation should be directed at understanding the optimal blend of in person and remote coaching needed to produce the greatest cost‐to‐benefit ratio.

AB: Effective interventions targeting comorbid obesity and depression are critical given the increasing prevalence and worsened outcomes for patients with both conditions. RAINBOW is a type 1 hybrid design randomized controlled trial. The objective is to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness and implementation potential of an integrated, technology‐enhanced, collaborative care model for treating comorbid obesity and depression in primary care. Obese and depressed adults (n = 404) will be randomized to usual care enhanced with the provision of a pedometer and information about the health system's services for mood or weight management (control) or with the Integrated Coaching for Better Mood and Weight (I‐CARE) program (intervention). The 12‐month I‐CARE program synergistically integrates two proven behavioral interventions: problem‐solving therapy with as‐needed intensification of pharmacotherapy for depression (PEARLS) and standardized behavioral treatment for obesity (Group Lifestyle Balance(™)). It utilizes traditional (e.g., office visits and phone consults) and emerging care delivery modalities (e.g., patient web portal and mobile applications). Follow‐up assessments will occur at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. We hypothesize that compared with controls, I‐CARE participants will have greater improvements in weight and depression severity measured by the 20‐item Depression Symptom Checklist at 12 months, which will be sustained at 24 months. We will also assess I‐CARE's cost‐effectiveness and use mixed methods to examine its potential for reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. This study offers the potential to change how obese and depressed adults are treated‐through a new model of accessible and integrative lifestyle medicine and mental health expertise‐in primary care.

AB: BACKGROUND: Telemedicine innovations, including short message service (SMS), have been used to address a range of health concerns in a variety of settings. Practical, safe, and cost‐effective, this simple tool can also potentially improve patients' understanding toward their own diseases via knowledge enhancement. This study was designed to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of an SMS‐based epilepsy educational program for epilepsy patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective randomized interventional study. Epilepsy outpatients from three general hospitals in East Coast Peninsular Malaysia received the SMS‐based mobile epilepsy educational system (MEES) for a 3‐month period. RESULTS: In total, 51 patients completed the study (median age, 25.0 years; 51.0% female; 92.2% Malay; 56.9% single; education level, 70.6% ≤SPM/Cambridge O‐level equivalent; 25.5% supportive workers; monthly income, 58.8% ≤MYR 500.0/USD 158.5). Approximately 86.0% of the patients owned at least a mobile phone. The total cost of SMS delivery was economically affordable (MYR 3.08/USD 0.98 per patient). Overall, 74.0% agreed that MEES was either very or quite useful. It is encouraging that the majority of patients have offered positive comments and favorable opinions specifically toward epilepsy education (94.0%), drug‐taking reminder (90.0%), and clinic appointment reminder (88.0%). It was also reported that 88.2% of the participants would recommend MEES to other people with epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: The current study adds to the growing evidence suggesting that a greater investment in telemedicine programs involving SMS would be both feasible and well received by patients and could be a potentially valuable approach to increase access and effectiveness of epilepsy care.

AB: OBJECTIVE: The Trial of WiiTM in Stroke investigated the efficacy of using the Nintendo Wii SportsTM (WiiTM) to improve affected arm function after stroke. DESIGN: Multicentre, pragmatic, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Home‐based rehabilitation. SUBJECTS: A total of 240 participants aged 24‐90years with arm weakness following a stroke within the previous six months. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to exercise daily for six weeks using the WiiTM or arm exercises at home. MAIN MEASURES: Primary outcome was change in the affected arm function at six weeks follow‐up using the Action Research Arm Test. Secondary outcomes included occupational performance, quality of life, arm function at six months and a cost effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: The study was completed by 209 participants (87.1%). There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of affected arm function at six weeks follow‐up (mean difference ‐1.7, 95% CI ‐3.9 to 0.5, p=0.12) and no significant difference in secondary outcomes, including occupational performance, quality of life or arm function at six months, between the two groups. No serious adverse events related to the study treatment were reported. The cost effectiveness analysis showed that the WiiTM was more expensive than arm exercises 1106 (SD 1656) vs. 730 (SD 829) (probability 0.866). CONCLUSION: The trial showed that the WiiTM was not superior to arm exercises in home‐based rehabilitation for stroke survivors with arm weakness. The WiiTM was well tolerated but more expensive than arm exercises.

AB: In the HIV Translating Initiatives for Depression into Effective Solutions project, we conducted a randomized controlled effectiveness and implementation trial comparing depression collaborative care with enhanced usual care in Veterans Health Administration HIV clinics in the US. An offsite HIV depression care team including a psychiatrist, a depression care manager (DCM), and a clinical pharmacist provided collaborative care using a stepped‐care model of treatment and made recommendations to providers through the electronic health record system. The DCM delivered care management to HIV patients through phone calls, performing routine assessments and providing counseling in self‐management and problem‐solving. The DCM documented all calls in each patient's electronic medical record. In this paper we present results from interviews conducted with patients and clinical staff in a multi‐stage formative evaluation (FE). We conducted semi‐structured FE interviews with 26 HIV patients and 30 clinical staff at the three participating sites during and after the trial period to gather their experiences and perspectives concerning the intervention components. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using rapid content analysis techniques. Patients reported high satisfaction with the depression care manager (DCM) phone calls. Both HIV and mental health providers reported that the DCM's chart notes in the electronic health record were very helpful, and most felt that a dedicated DCM for HIV patients is ideal to meet patient needs. Sites encountered barriers to achieving and maintaining universal depression screening, but had greater success when such screening was incorporated into routine intake processes. FE results demonstrated that depression care management via telehealth from an offsite team is acceptable and helpful to both HIV patients and their providers. Given that a centralized offsite depression care team can deliver effective, cost‐effective, cost‐saving services for multiple HIV clinics in different locations with high patient and provider satisfaction, broad implementation should be considered.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Rural smokers are more likely to be uninsured and live in poverty, which may pose significant cost barriers to accessing smoking cessation medications. As part of a randomized clinical trial, we provided support to connect low‐income smokers with the use of pharmaceutical assistance programs (PAPs) to improve medication access. METHODS: Study participants were rural smokers enrolled in a randomized clinical trial testing in‐office telemedicine versus telephone‐based approaches to deliver counseling sessions. For potentially qualified participants, we developed a system to connect them with PAPs that provided smoking cessation medications at low or no cost. Participants reported medication utilization 3 and 6 months after randomization. RESULTS: Of the 560 study participants, 312 (55.7%) met initial screening criteria for PAP eligibility. Of those eligible, 104 (33.3%) initiated a PAP application, with 49 (15.7%) completing the application and ultimately receiving medications through the programs. Despite the availability of assistance with the PAP application process, overall medication use among those that were eligible for PAP was significantly lower than among participants with higher incomes or access to prescription insurance (60.4% vs. 51.3%; P = 0.04). Abstinence among PAP‐eligible smokers was also lower at the 3‐month follow‐up (P = 0.01), but this difference was not present at the 6‐ and 12‐month follow‐up surveys. CONCLUSION: With substantial assistance, some low‐income smokers without prescription insurance can get effective smoking cessation medications through PAPs, but overall access remains worse than among those with higher incomes or prescription insurance.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To test the effectiveness of weekly postoperative pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) versus supportive telephone contact by a urology nurse for men at 4 weeks after radical prostatectomy. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial in three Canadian centers. At 4 weeks after surgery, standardized verbal and written instruction about PFMT was provided to all subjects. Randomization occurred after initial instruction. Continence was defined as 8 g or less of urine loss on a 24‐hour pad test. Primary outcome was grams of urine loss on pad test; secondary outcomes were International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ‐7) score, cost, and perception of urine loss as a problem. Data were obtained at baseline (preoperatively) and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 28 and 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 216 men were enrolled; 11 were dry or withdrew at 4 weeks. Ninety‐nine were randomized to the control group and 106 to the treatment group. There were no group differences at baseline for prostate‐specific antigen level (mean [standard deviation] 8.4 [10.4] ng/mL; 7.6 [4.6] ng/mL), Gleason score (6.3 [0.86]), IPSS, IIQ‐7 score, pad test, or voiding diary. At 8 weeks 23% of the control group and 20% of the treatment group were continent; at 12 weeks, 28% and 32%; 16 weeks, 40% and 44%; 28 weeks, 50% and 47%; and at 52 weeks, 64% and 60%, respectively. There were no significant differences between groups at any time point for the outcome variables. CONCLUSIONS: Verbal instruction and written information with telephone support seemed to be as effective as intensive PFMT. Less‐intense therapy may be more cost‐effective.

AB: BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the Western world. The most substantial long term morbidity from this cancer is sexual dysfunction with consequent adverse changes in couple and intimate relationships. Research to date has not identified an effective way to improve sexual and psychosocial adjustment for both men with prostate cancer and their partners. As well, the efficacy and cost effectiveness of peer counselling as opposed to professional models of service delivery has not yet been empirically tested. This paper presents the design of a three arm randomised controlled trial (peer vs. nurse counselling vs. usual care) that will evaluate the efficacy of two couples‐based sexuality interventions (ProsCan for Couples: Peer support vs. nurse counselling) on men's and women's sexual and psychosocial adjustment after surgical treatment for localised prostate cancer; in addition to cost‐effectiveness. METHODS/DESIGN: Seventy couples per condition (210 couples in total) will be recruited after diagnosis and before treatment through urology private practices and hospital outpatient clinics and randomised to (1) usual care; (2) eight sessions of peer‐delivered telephone support with DVD education; and (3) eight sessions of oncology nurse‐delivered telephone counselling with DVD education. Two intervention sessions will be delivered before surgery and six over the six months post‐surgery. The intervention will utilise a cognitive behavioural approach along with couple relationship education focussed on relationship enhancement and helping the couple to conjointly manage the stresses of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Participants will be assessed at baseline (before surgery) and 3, 6 and 12 months post‐surgery. Outcome measures include: sexual adjustment; unmet sexuality supportive care needs; attitudes to sexual help seeking; psychological adjustment; benefit finding and quality of life. DISCUSSION: The study will provide recommendations about the efficacy of peer support vs. nurse counselling to facilitate better sexual and couple adjustment after prostate cancer as well as recommendations on whether the interventions represent efficient health service delivery.

AB: BACKGROUND: By 2025, it is estimated that approximately 1.8 million Australian adults (approximately 8.4% of the adult population) will have diabetes, with the majority having type 2 diabetes. Weight management via improved physical activity and diet is the cornerstone of type 2 diabetes management. However, the majority of weight loss trials in diabetes have evaluated short‐term, intensive clinic‐based interventions that, while producing short‐term outcomes, have failed to address issues of maintenance and broad population reach. Telephone‐delivered interventions have the potential to address these gaps. METHODS/DESIGN: Using a two‐arm randomised controlled design, this study will evaluate an 18‐month, telephone‐delivered, behavioural weight loss intervention focussing on physical activity, diet and behavioural therapy, versus usual care, with follow‐up at 24 months. Three‐hundred adult participants, aged 20‐75 years, with type 2 diabetes, will be recruited from 10 general practices via electronic medical records search. The Social‐Cognitive Theory driven intervention involves a six‐month intensive phase (4 weekly calls and 11 fortnightly calls) and a 12‐month maintenance phase (one call per month). Primary outcomes, assessed at 6, 18 and 24 months, are: weight loss, physical activity, and glycaemic control (HbA1c), with weight loss and physical activity also measured at 12 months. Incremental cost‐effectiveness will also be examined. Study recruitment began in February 2009, with final data collection expected by February 2013. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to evaluate the telephone as the primary method of delivering a behavioural weight loss intervention in type 2 diabetes. The evaluation of maintenance outcomes (6 months following the end of intervention), the use of accelerometers to objectively measure physical activity, and the inclusion of a cost‐effectiveness analysis will advance the science of broad reach approaches to weight control and health behaviour change, and will build the evidence base needed to advocate for the translation of this work into population health practice.

AB: Introduction Pregnant women, postpartum women, and infants are at high risk for complications from influenza. From October to November 2012, Text4baby, a free national text service for pregnant women and mothers of infants aged <1 year, implemented a module of interactive messages encouraging maternal influenza vaccination. A program evaluation examined whether a text‐based reminder or tailored education improved self‐reported influenza vaccination or intent to be vaccinated later in the influenza season among Text4baby participants. Methods Nearly one third (28,609/89,792) of enrollees responded to a text asking about their vaccination plans. Those planning to receive vaccination were randomly assigned to receive an encouragement message or an encouragement message plus the opportunity to schedule a reminder (n=3,021 at follow‐up). Those not planning to be vaccinated were randomly assigned to receive general education or education tailored to their reason for non‐vaccination (n=3,820 at follow‐up). The effect of the enhanced messages was assessed using multinomial logistic regression in 2013‐2014. Results A reminder increased the odds of vaccination at follow‐up among mothers (AOR=2.0, 95% CI=1.4, 2.9) and of continued intent to be vaccinated later in the season (pregnant, AOR=2.1, 95% CI=1.4, 3.1; mother, AOR=1.7, 95% CI=1.1, 2.5). Among mothers not planning to be vaccinated because of cost, those who received a tailored message about low‐cost vaccination had higher odds of vaccination at follow‐up (AOR=1.9, 95% CI=1.1, 3.5). Other tailored messages were not effective. Conclusions Text reminders and tailored education may encourage influenza vaccination among this vulnerable population; both have now been incorporated into Text4baby.

AB: Background: Remote patientmonitoring is a safe and effective alternative for the in‐clinic follow‐up of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). However, evidence on the patient perspective on remote monitoring is scarce and inconsistent.Objectives: The primary objective of the REMOTE‐CIED study is to evaluate the influence of remote patient monitoring versus in‐clinic follow‐up on patient‐reported outcomes. Secondary objectives are to: 1) identify subgroups of patients who may not be satisfied with remote monitoring; and 2) investigate the cost‐effectiveness of remote monitoring.Methods: The REMOTE‐CIED study is an international randomised controlled study that will include 900 consecutive heart failure patients implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) compatible with the Boston Scientific LATITUDE® Remote Patient Management system at participating centres in five European countries. Patients will be randomised to remote monitoring or in‐clinic followup. The In‐Clinic group will visit the outpatient clinic every 3– 6 months, according to standard practice. The Remote Monitoring group only visits the outpatient clinic at 12 and 24 months post‐implantation, other check‐ups are performed remotely. Patients are asked to complete questionnaires at five time points during the 2‐year follow‐up.Conclusion: The REMOTE‐CIED study will provide insight into the patient perspective on remote monitoring in ICD patients, which could help to support patient‐centred care in the future.

AB: The number of patients with heart failure implantable cardiac electronic devices (CIEDs) is growing. Hospitalization rate in this group is very high and generates enormous costs. To avoid the need for hospital treatment, optimized monitoring and follow‐up is crucial. Remote monitoring (RM) has been widely put into practice in the management of CIEDs but it may be difficult due to the presence of differences in systems provided by device manufacturers and loss of gathered data in case of device reimplantation. Additionally, conclusions derived from studies about usefulness of RM in clinical practice apply to devices coming only from a single company. An integrated monitoring platform allows for more comprehensive data analysis and interpretation. Therefore, the primary objective of Remote Supervision to Decrease Hospitalization Rate (RESULT) study is to evaluate the impact of RM on the clinical status of patients with ICDs or CRT‐Ds using an integrated platform. Six hundred consecutive patients with ICDs or CRT‐Ds implanted will be prospectively randomized to either a traditional or RM‐based follow‐up model. The primary clinical endpoint will be a composite of all‐cause mortality or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons within 12 months after randomization. The primary technical endpoint will be to construct and evaluate a unified and integrated platform for the data collected from RM devices manufactured by different companies. This manuscript describes the design and methodology of the prospective, randomized trial designed to determine whether remote monitoring using an integrated platform for different companies is safe, feasible, and efficacious (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02409225).

AB: Aims Contrast‐induced nephropathy (CIN) and periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) represent frequent complications of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and negatively impact subsequent length of hospitalization, costs of adjunctive diagnostic‐therapeutic measures and mid‐term cardiovascular events. The aim of the EURO‐CRIPS trial is to test whether remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) may reduce the incidence of these complications and improve mid‐term outcome. Methods This will be a double‐blind, randomized, placebocontrolled multicentre study. Patients will be allocated 1:1 to RIPC or standard therapy if they were younger than 85 years old, with a renal clearance in the interval 30‐60 ml/min/1.73m2 and candidate to PCI for all clinical indications except for primary PCI in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), unstable haemodynamic presentations or ongoing severe arrhythmias. Incidence of CIN will be the primary end point and the amount of periprocedural cardiac enzyme leakage will be the secondary end point. In addition, we will evaluate whether the preconditioned patients will have a reduction of MACCE at 6 months (major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event). Conclusion: The EURO‐CRIPS Study will be the first largescale, multicentre clinical trial to test the role of RIPC in current clinical practice. The results of this randomized trial will provide important insights to optimize management strategy of patients undergoing PCI and to improve their outcome

AB: Aims Contrast‐induced nephropathy (CIN) and periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) represent frequent complications of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and negatively impact subsequent length of hospitalization, costs of adjunctive diagnostic‐therapeutic measures and mid‐term cardiovascular events. The aim of the EURO‐CRIPS trial is to test whether remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) may reduce the incidence of these complications and improve mid‐term outcome. Methods This will be a double‐blind, randomized, placebocontrolled multicentre study. Patients will be allocated 1:1 to RIPC or standard therapy if they were younger than 85 years old, with a renal clearance in the interval 30‐60 ml/min/1.73m2 and candidate to PCI for all clinical indications except for primary PCI in ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), unstable haemodynamic presentations or ongoing severe arrhythmias. Incidence of CIN will be the primary end point and the amount of periprocedural cardiac enzyme leakage will be the secondary end point. In addition, we will evaluate whether the preconditioned patients will have a reduction of MACCE at 6 months (major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event). Conclusion: The EURO‐CRIPS Study will be the first largescale, multicentre clinical trial to test the role of RIPC in current clinical practice.

AB: Currently, there is limited access to movement disorder specialist centers for a significant portion of the PD population. Treatment effectiveness is judged during office visits by improvement of patient motor symptoms and quality of life. Clinicians evaluate patients by having them perform specific motor tasks and rating the severity on a 0‐4 scale. A major limitation is that a single evaluation in a clinical setting may not accurately reflect motor symptom fluctuations experienced over the course of a day, week, or month. Clinicians currently lack effective, affordable medical devices that can be easily delivered to a patient's home for monitoring symptoms on a more continuous basis as motor symptoms typically change throughout the day. Kinesia HomeView provides a repeatable, automated system clinicians can use to remotely monitor PD motor symptoms on a more continuous basis in a patient's home. The investigators hypothesize use of the Kinesia HomeView system will improve outcomes and decrease costs especially for patient populations in areas not in close proximity to movement disorder specialists.

AB: BACKGROUND: measuring cognitive function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) can be challenging given the obstacles faced when traveling to testing centers. OBJECTIVE: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of remote cognitive assessment in patients with MS using the automated neuropsychological assessment metrics (ANAM‐MS) and the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). METHODS: patients meeting the McDonald criteria for MS (n = 24) were randomized to complete the live‐in‐office condition or a remote‐in‐office condition first, with all patients completing both sessions. Patients (n = 20) then completed a final remote‐in‐home testing session. Both remote sessions were proctored by a psychologist using a secure telehealth connection. RESULTS: scores on the live SDMT differed from scores in the two remote settings F(2, 38) = 4.46, p = 0.018. However, summary scores on the ANAM‐MS were similar across the three settings, F(2, 36) = 2.21, p = 0.124. Satisfaction with telehealth testing was high on the part of the examiner and patients. Each telehealth testing session saved more than $144.00 in travel costs and lost wages. CONCLUSION: this study demonstrated that valid results can be obtained when evaluating patients remotely using ANAM‐MS. Some differences were noted for the SDMT that suggest that either specific norms or a different implementation approach may be needed for telehealth.

AB: Internet‐delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) is effective for treating anxiety and depression. The relative benefits of offering standard weekly compared to optional weekly therapist support in conjunction with ICBT within routine care has not been examined. Patients seeking ICBT for depression and or anxiety in routine care were randomized to standard (n=92) or optional (n=88) weekly support. The optional approach resulted in therapists receiving half as many messages from (1.70 vs. 3.96) and sending half as many messages to patients (3.62 vs. 7.29). Optional Support was associated with lower completion rates (56.6% versus 82.4%), but, similar to Standard Support, resulted in large reductions on the GAD‐7 (within Cohen's d≥1.08; avg. reduction ≥47%) and PHQ‐9 (within Cohen's d≥0.82; avg. reduction ≥43%) at post‐treatment and 3‐month follow‐up. Optional weekly support appears clinically effective and acceptable for many patients and may reduce costs, but safety requires monitoring given lower completion rates.

AB: We investigated the effectiveness and efficiency of a four‐week myofeedback‐based teletreatment service in subjects with non‐specific neck and shoulder pain. Subjects were recruited in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands and randomly allocated to the intervention or conventional care. Subjects in the intervention group received four weeks of myofeedback training. Pain intensity and disability were evaluated by questionnaires at baseline, immediately after four weeks of treatment and at follow‐up 3 months later. To investigate efficiency, the time‐investment of both therapists and patients were assessed. Seventy‐one subjects were included in the study (36 in the intervention group and 35 in the conventional care group). Myofeedback‐based teletreatment was at least as effective clinically as conventional care. Pain intensity and disability decreased after 4 weeks of treatment in both groups and part of the effect remained at 3 months' follow‐up. The teletreatment also increased efficiency for therapists by almost 20% and patients experienced the benefits of less travel time and travel costs by remote consultation. Myofeedback‐based teletreatment has the potential to ensure more efficient treatment for patients with non‐specific neck and shoulder pain.

AB: Frequent follow up and interaction with patients greatly improves diabetes control, but the current healthcare system limits sufficient contact, leading to delays in improvement of control. We have modified a text message based system using cellular telephones developed to send clinical reminders to patients (MedAdherence Inc.). The diabetes remote monitoring system (DRMS) sends patients text messages reminding them to test blood glucose, which the patient can text back. Using a modification of the ADA algorithm, the system automatically advises patients on changes to medications including insulin dose adjustment. In addition, simple messages on healthy living were sent via cellphone at random intervals. There is no human contact other than for emergency glucose values or routine appointments.We carried out a pilot feasibility trial of the system in 18 patients with T2DM who were randomized to DRMS or usual care for six months. The mean (+SD) HbA1c in patients on DRMS fell from 8.2 + 0.6 to 7.2 +0.8 (p=0.013) and with routine care from 8.3 + 0.2 to 8.2 +0.9 (P=0.600). Six patients in each group completed the study, and all patients randomized to DRMS expressed satisfaction and ease of use of the system.We conclude that an automated system for diabetes medication adjustment based on standard algorithms using text messaging via cellular phone is feasible and improves diabetes control with low incremental costs. Larger clinical trials are needed to establish this technology in clinical practice.

AB: PURPOSE: The prevalence of obesity in rural and remote areas is elevated in comparison to urban populations, highlighting the need for interventions targeting obesity prevention in these settings. Implementing evidence‐based obesity prevention programs is challenging. This study aimed to investigate factors influencing the implementation of obesity prevention programs, including adoption, program delivery, community uptake, and continuation, specifically within rural settings. METHODS: Nested within a large‐scale randomized controlled trial, a qualitative exploratory approach was adopted, with purposive sampling techniques utilized, to recruit stakeholders from 41 small rural towns in Australia. In‐depth semistructured interviews were conducted with clinical health professionals, health service managers, and local government employees. Open coding was completed independently by 2 investigators and thematic analysis undertaken. FINDINGS: In‐depth interviews revealed that obesity prevention programs were valued by the rural workforce. Program implementation is influenced by interrelated factors across: (1) contextual factors and (2) organizational capacity. Key recommendations to manage the challenges of implementing evidence‐based programs focused on reducing program delivery costs, aided by the provision of a suite of implementation and evaluation resources. Informing the scale‐up of future prevention programs, stakeholders highlighted the need to build local rural capacity through developing supportive university partnerships, generating local program ownership and promoting active feedback to all program partners. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that the rural workforce places a high value on obesity prevention programs. Our results inform the future scale‐up of obesity prevention programs, providing an improved understanding of strategies to optimize implementation of evidence‐based prevention programs.

AB: Background: Diagnostic outcomes in eating disorder (ED) risk reduction trials are important but rarely reported. Methods: An online pragmatic randomized‐controlled trial was conducted with young‐adult women in Australia and New Zealand seeking to improve their body image. Media Smart‐Targeted (MS‐T) was a 9‐module program released weekly while control participants received tips for positive body image. Eating Disorder Examination‐Questionnaire (EDE‐Q) scores from baseline and 12‐month follow‐up were used to investigate two outcomes: ED onset in those who were asymptomatic at baseline (prevention effects); and, ED remission in those who met diagnosis at baseline (treatment effects). Results: MS‐T participants were 66% less likely than controls to develop an ED by 12‐month follow‐up (nonsignificant). MS‐T participants who met ED criteria at baseline were 75% less likely than controls to still meet diagnostic criteria at follow‐up. This effect was significant and remained so for both those who did and who did not access external face‐to‐face ED treatment during the trial. Conclusions: While further investigations are necessary, MS‐T has fully automated procedures, low implementation costs, the potential to be delivered at‐scale to assist those assist those where face‐to‐face services are limited or not available (e.g., remote areas).

AB: BACKGROUND: We examined the effects of home‐delivered cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression on anxiety symptoms in an ethnically diverse, low resource, and medically frail sample of rural, older adults. METHOD: This was a secondary analysis of a randomized clincial trial with 134 rural‐dwelling adults 65 years and older with decreased quality of life and elevated psychological symptomatology. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the anxiety and phobic anxiety subscales of the Symptom Checklist‐90‐Revised (SCL‐90‐R). RESULTS: Compared to a minimal support control condition, CBT for depression resulted in significantly greater improvements in symptoms of anxiety and phobic anxiety from pre‐treatment to post‐treatment. CONCLUSION: Home‐delivered CBT for depression can be an effective treatment for anxiety in a hard‐to‐reach older populations. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Additional research should explore integrated anxiety and depression protocols and other treatment modalities, including bibliotherapy or telehealth models of CBT, to reduce costs associated with its in home delivery. Flexibility in administration and adaptations to the CBT protocol may be necessary for use with vulnerable, rural older adults.

AB: Background. Hospitalization accounts for 70 of heart failure (HF) costs; readmission rates at 30 days are 24 and rise to 50 by 90 days. Agencies anticipate that telehomecare will provide the close monitoring necessary to prevent HF readmissions. Methods and Results. Randomized controlled trial to compare a telehomecare intervention for patients 55 and older following hospital discharge for HF to usual skilled home care. Primary endpoints were 30‐ and 60‐day all‐cause and HF readmission, hospital days, and time to readmission or death. Secondary outcomes were access to care, emergency department (ED) use, and satisfaction with care. All‐cause readmissions at 30 days (16 versus 19) and over six months (46 versus 52) were lower in the telehomecare group but were not statistically significant. Access to care and satisfaction were significantly higher for the telehomecare patients, including the number of in‐person visits and days in home care. Conclusions. Patient acceptance of the technology and current home care policies and processes of care were barriers to gaining clinical effectiveness and efficiency. Copyright © 2011 Kathryn H. Bowles et al.

AB: Pain is the most common physical symptom in primary care, accounting for an enormous burden in terms of patient suffering, quality of life, work and social disability, and health care and societal costs. Although collaborative care interventions are well‐established for conditions such as depression, fewer systems‐based interventions have been tested for chronic pain. This paper describes the study design and baseline characteristics of the enrolled sample for the Stepped Care to Optimize Pain care Effectiveness (SCOPE) study, a randomized clinical effectiveness trial conducted in five primary care clinics. SCOPE has enrolled 250 primary care veterans with persistent (3 months or longer) musculoskeletal pain of moderate severity and randomized them to either the stepped care intervention or usual care control group. Using a telemedicine collaborative care approach, the intervention couples automated symptom monitoring with a telephone‐based, nurse care manager/physician pain specialist team to treat pain. The goal is to optimize analgesic management using a stepped care approach to drug selection, symptom monitoring, dose adjustment, and switching or adding medications. All subjects undergo comprehensive outcome assessments at baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months by interviewers blinded to treatment group. The primary outcome is pain severity/disability, and secondary outcomes include pain beliefs and behaviors, psychological functioning, health‐related quality of life and treatment satisfaction. Innovations of SCOPE include optimized analgesic management (including a stepped care approach, opioid risk stratification, and criteria‐based medication adjustment), automated monitoring, and centralized care management that can cover multiple primary care practices.

AB: INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the effects of an advanced practice nurse‐delivered telehealth intervention on health care use by children with medical complexity (CMC). Because CMC account for a large share of health care use costs, finding effective ways to care for them is an important challenge requiring exploration. METHOD: This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial with a control group and two intervention groups. The focus of the analysis was planned and unplanned clinical and therapy visits by CMC over a 30‐month data collection period. Nonparametric tests were used to compare visit counts among and within the three groups. RESULTS: The number of unplanned visits decreased over time across all groups, with the greatest decrease in the video telehealth intervention group. Planned visits were higher in the video telehealth group across all time periods. DISCUSSION: Advanced practice registered nurse‐delivered telehealth care coordination may support a shift from unplanned to planned health care service use among CMC.

KY: Depression
AB: Depression is a major psychiatric disorder globally, including in India. One of the most effective approaches to treat depression is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), but its reach is limited by the dearth of trained psychiatrists, especially in remote areas, and the high costs and stigma associated with visits to a psychiatric clinic. Delivering CBT through a computer, with limited or no intervention from a psychiatrist, could address these limitations. Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CCBT) is thus emerging as a more accessible and economical alternative to CBT. Despite some evidence of its efficacy, CCBT use is limited because the existing software programs used to deliver the therapy provide a much lower level of personalization and engagement than in‐person therapy. The objective of this study is to assess if the new algorithm makes CCBT more efficacious, acceptable and engaging to users. Depression severity as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9) is expected to reduce over the duration of the study, more significantly in the treatment group compared to the control group. Participants will be recruited online through a website that will check compatibility with inclusion/exclusion criteria and get the informed consent.

TI: The Impact of Telemedicine to Support Palliative Care Resident in Nursing Home
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02821143
YR: 2016
AB: According to current statistics, approximately 12 % of all deaths in France occur in Nursing Home, with the number over 25% in USA. With the ageing of the population, this rate is expected to dramatically increase in the next years, to reach 40% in USA in 2020. Yet, there is some evidence that palliative care is often inadequate in Nursing Home: there is a difficulty to recognize residents who might benefit palliative care and their needs, an underassessment and under‐treatment of pain and other end‐of‐life symptoms, and frequent burdensome treatments and hospitalizations. Several programs including palliative care consult service (with outside consultant), Nursing Home‐based palliative care or Nursing Home‐hospice partnerships, have succeeded in delivering high‐quality palliative care in Nursing Home. But, to our knowledge, no studies examined the benefit of telemedicine for palliative care in nursing home. During a 6 month‐inclusion period, residents with palliative care needs will be included in both arms. In the intervention group, Telemedicine consultations involving Nursing Home staff and the palliative and/or geriatric unit from the University Hospital, will be organized systematically at inclusion and during the follow‐up if needed. In both groups, hospitalizations and emergency hospitalizations, quality of life of the resident, satisfaction of the nursing home staff and health costs will be recorded during 6 months.

AB: A psychoeducational intervention (Keep your brain fit!) was designed for the middle‐aged and older working population. The intervention focuses on increasing knowledge and awareness about cognitive ageing and teaching strategies to cope with cognitive changes. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the e‐health intervention in terms of subjective cognitive functioning. As secondary aims, objective cognitive functioning and psychological well‐being were also measured. A randomised controlled trial that included people aged 40 to 65 years was conducted. A maximum of 4 weeks was allowed to complete the intervention. The outcome measures were obtained from an online test battery that was administered at baseline, post‐test and at 4‐week follow‐up. A total of 376 participants completed the whole study. After the intervention, the experimental group reported more feelings of stability concerning memory functioning and perceived greater locus of control over memory compared to the control group. These effects were maintained at the 4‐week follow‐up. Taking into account the relatively low costs and easy accessibility of this e‐health intervention, we consider the programme to be a valuable contribution to public healthcare interventions for middle‐aged and older adults.

AB: Objective. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a serious health problem in Taiwan. The high dropout rate due to side effects limits the efficacy of treatment. The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of telecare for the treatment of chronic hepatitis. Material and Methods. Two hundred and ninety‐eight patients randomly chose either of the two support programs. Group 1 was offered public health nurse consultation at outpatient clinic. Group 2 was offered telecare program with 24 hours of consultation services via a health communication center. All patients were treated with standard therapy and followed up for 72 weeks. Results. Normalization of serum biochemistry was noted in both Group 1 (150 patients) and Group 2 (148 patients). The most common types of side effect in both groups were influenza‐like symptoms. Patient compliance was 88% (Group 1) and 94.6% (Group 2). Total dropout cases were 18 (12%) in Group 1 and 8 (5.4%) in Group 2. The program costs were 232,632 USD (Group 1) and 112,500 USD (Group 2). Conclusion. Telecare system with health care communication center model is significant in reducing dropout rate and is more effective with easy access. © 2014 Wan‐Lin Chen et al.

AB: Elderly patients are at high risk of malnutrition and sarcopenia, promoting further morbidity which in turn decreases quality of life and increases the claiming of medical services and associated costs. Early and sustained administration of oral nutritional supplements has been shown to improve the nutritional status with robust clinical benefit. Many patients however, poorly adhere to prescribed supplements, so consistent monitoring is needed. Clinical monitoring usually ends with the discharge rendering the continuation of nutritional supplement therapy in the patient's home problematic. We developed a telemedicine based health care concept for intensive home monitoring. In a first randomized controlled prospective study we analyzed the feasibility of this innovative approach. The intervention group received oral nutritional supplements and telemedical monitoring with daily assessment of body weight, number of taken oral energy supplements and state of health. The control group received usual care. 13 patients were included in each group, eight patients of the intervention group left the study prematurely, five patients were closely monitored and used the devices for a mean 67 ± 63.5 days. Follow up data of body weight and BMI showed no relevant differences between both groups. The results and experiences gained in this pilot study demonstrate that telemedical systems provide encouraging new options to enable an intensive monitoring of malnourished patients. A continuous intensive therapy monitoring of this patient group however, is a particular challenge. Albeit possibilities, limitations and useful parameters were identified, which will be used to improve the conception in an ongoing prospective randomized trial.

AB: OBJECTIVE: to assess the impact of telecare on the use of social and health care. Part of the evaluation of the Whole Systems Demonstrator trial. Participants and setting: a total of 2,600 people with social care needs were recruited from 217 general practices in three areas in England. DESIGN: a cluster randomised trial comparing telecare with usual care, general practice being the unit of randomisation. Participants were followed up for 12 months and analyses were conducted as intention‐to‐treat. Data sources: trial data were linked at the person level to administrative data sets on care funded at least in part by local authorities or the National Health Service. Main outcome measures: the proportion of people admitted to hospital within 12 months. Secondary endpoints included mortality, rates of secondary care use (seven different metrics), contacts with general practitioners and practice nurses, proportion of people admitted to permanent residential or nursing care, weeks in domiciliary social care and notional costs. RESULTS: 46.8% of intervention participants were admitted to hospital, compared with 49.2% of controls. Unadjusted differences were not statistically significant (odds ratio: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.75‐1.07, P = 0.211). They reached statistical significance after adjusting for baseline covariates, but this was not replicated when adjusting for the predictive risk score. Secondary metrics including impacts on social care use were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: telecare as implemented in the Whole Systems Demonstrator trial did not lead to significant reductions in service use, at least in terms of results assessed over 12 months.

KY: Diabetes, Gestational
AB: Gestational diabetes, diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy, affects 8.8% of pregnancies in Spain that means more than 40,000 women per year. This prevalence is based on the National Diabetes Data Group criteria, previous to the 4th workshop on Gestational Diabetes (1998), but, if the new diagnosis criteria proposed by the International Associations of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups, based on the most important study never made before on this topic, prevalence would increase to the double. When a women is diagnosed, the risk of complications for her and the child increases and, therefore, she has to start an specific diet and frequent visits to the diabetes center in order to check that glucose values do not exceed 95 mg/dl before or 140 mg/dl 1‐hour after meals. In other case, she should start insulin treatment. Our project is aimed to develop intelligent tools based on neuro‐diffuse techniques and integrated in a telemedicine system that allows control of gestational diabetes automatically, guaranteeing glucose control objectives consecution and avoiding face‐to‐face visits to the health care center. Furthermore, educational and motivation tools for a healthy behaviour will be included. At the end of the study efficacy and security about insulin management will be compare with the recommendations proposed by the diabetes team and data about direct and indirect costs will be calculated. The investigators anticipate that the smart telemedicine system can allow us to detect high blood glucose values earlier than in‐person scheduled visits.

AB: BACKGROUND: Little is known about how colorectal cancer screening test preferences operate together with test access and navigation to influence screening adherence in primary care. METHODS: We analyzed data from a randomized trial of 945 primary care patients to assess the independent effects of screening test preference for fecal immunochemical test (FIT) or colonoscopy, mailed access to FIT and colonoscopy, and telephone navigation for FIT and colonoscopy, on screening. RESULTS: Preference was not associated with overall screening, but individuals who preferred FIT were more likely to complete FIT screening (P = 0.005), whereas those who preferred colonoscopy were more likely to perform colonoscopy screening (P = 0.032). Mailed access to FIT and colonoscopy was associated with increased overall screening (OR = 2.6, P = 0.001), due to a 29‐fold increase in FIT use. Telephone navigation was also associated with increased overall screening (OR = 2.1, P = 0.005), mainly due to a 3‐fold increase in colonoscopy performance. We estimated that providing access and navigation for both screening tests may substantially increase screening compared with a preference‐tailored approach, mainly due to increased performance of nonpreferred tests. CONCLUSIONS: Preference influences the type of screening tests completed. Test access increases FIT and navigation mainly increases colonoscopy. Screening strategies providing access and navigation to both tests may be more effective than preference‐tailored approaches. IMPACT: Preference tailoring in colorectal cancer screening strategies should be avoided if the objective is to maximize screening rates, although other factors (e.g., costs, necessary follow‐up) should also be considered.

AB: Background: Telemedicine is one of the newest communication technologies being used in different fields of medicine. It is defined as an interaction between one ormore health care professionals or between patients and health care professionals. Objective: The aim of this study was determine whether telemedicine in pediatric dermatology improves themanagement of pediatric patients with dermatological diseases. Methods: 130 children with dermatological diseases were included. All children were seen in our outclinic paediatric dermatology at University Medical CenterMainz. Whenever a second visit was necessary children and parents were asked to take part in the telemedicine project. For the second visit the patients were randomized in two groups: personal inspection or using telemedicine by sending pictures and emails. This project was conducted with approval by the local ethics committee. After the second appointment both groups (parents and children) had to answer a questionnaire including the following topics: satisfaction with treatment, safety concerns, quality of life, socio‐economic costs, and time savings. Results and Conclusion: 130 children with pediatric dermatological diseases were included (aged 3 months‐17 years). 15 were lost during followup. Compliance was high. The answers clearly showed that parents were highly satisfied with the opportunity to get in contact with the physician over the telemedicine communication medium.

AB: Background: An explicit goal of Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs) within the Veterans Health Administration is to promote continuity of care in primary care clinics and thereby reduce Emergency Department (ED) utilization; however, there has been little research to guide PACTs on how to accomplish this. Objectives: The overall goal of this study is to examine the impact of a primary care‐based nurse telephone support program [DISPO ED] on Veterans treated and released from the ED who are at high risk for repeat visits. Methods: This study is a two group randomized, controlled trial to evaluate DISPO ED for Veterans treated and released from the ED who are at high risk for repeat visits. We define high risk as those who have had an ED visit or hospitalization during the 6. month period before the index ED visit and have > 2 chronic conditions. Veterans are randomized to nurse telephone support or usual care. The primary outcome is repeat ED use within 30. days; secondary outcomes are patient satisfaction with care and total costs. Discussion: The results of this randomized, controlled trial with an Effectiveness‐Implementation Type I Hybrid design will be directly relevant to the care of more than 500,000 high risk patients seen in Veterans' Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) EDs annually. Results will also be informative to health systems outside VA aiming to reduce ED use through accountable care organizations.

KY: Colorectal Neoplasms
AB: Resection of large sessile polyps in the colon (usually more than 2 cm) or those nonpolypoid neoplastic lesions (also called laterally spreading tumors or LST), confers technical difficulty and often are forced to remove into fragmented resection or endoscopic piecemeal mucosal resection. This has been associated with a recurrence of 25%. For this reason, clinical guidelines recommend endoscopic follow‐up at 2 to 6 months after piecemeal resection of colorectal polyps to check for residual neoplasia. Narrow‐Band Imaging (NBI, Olympus) improves visibility and identification of the surface and vascular structures of colon polyps. In contrast to conventional chromoendoscopy, it is easily activated by pressing a button on the endoscope. Virtual or conventional chromoendoscopy are applied during resection of polyps defining the border of the lesion. However, there are few studies using Narrow Band Imaging and do not allow to know whether the use of this technique could improve the detection of residual tumor after fragmented polypectomy and avoid complications, time and costs of biopsy and histological analysis. In this context, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) has recently published the first Guideline of Advanced Endoscopic Imaging for the Detection and Differentiation of Colorectal Neoplasia and recommends conventional or virtual chromoendoscopy in patients with piecemeal polypectomy scar (strong recommendation, low quality evidence). The investigators will perform a randomised, controlled trial of tandem colonoscopy using NBI and WLE. The main goal is to compare the rate of detected neoplasia between both techniques and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of NBI and WLE to histology as the gold standard.

AB: Background: Telehealth has been proposed as an alternative means to providing traditional modes of care while alleviating the need for participant travel and reducing overall healthcare costs. The purpose of this study was to explore contemporary perspectives of patients and stakeholders regarding non‐participation in telehealth trials. Methods: We undertook a two‐phase exploratory qualitative study to understand the reasons behind patient non‐participation in telehealth. Data were collected through semi‐structured interviews with non‐participating patient participants (n = 8) and stakeholders (n = 27) including clinicians, study investigators, and study staff. An analysis of interview data were undertaken and guided by a qualitative descriptive approach. Findings: Patients and stakeholders reported many barriers to telehealth participation including technological barriers, limited understanding of disease, and an understated need for services. Both groups had some overlap in their concerns but also provided unique insights. Conclusion: The analysis of study findings revealed perspectives of patients and stakeholders including barriers to participation as well as suggestions for future telehealth initiatives. Further research is needed to explore non‐participation including patient readiness to assist in the development of future telehealth programs. Copyright © 2018

AB: BACKGROUND: A number of studies have demonstrated the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) in specific phobias, but research in seriously impaired patients with agoraphobia is lacking. In this randomized controlled trial with patients with agoraphobia and panic disorder, VRET and exposure in vivo were compared in terms of outcome and processes involved. METHODS: Patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia (n = 55) were randomly assigned to receive 4 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) followed by either 6 sessions of VRET or 6 sessions of exposure in vivo or to a waiting list control condition. RESULTS: Analyses showed that both active treatment packages were significantly more effective than no treatment and that no differences between VRET and exposure in vivo were found in three out of four outcome measures. On the panic disorder severity scale, however, CBT plus exposure in vivo was more effective than CBT plus VRET. The results show clear synchrony of temporal processes involved in VRET and exposure in vivo on weekly avoidance measures and cognitive measures. Further, it was shown that initial changes in agoraphobic cognitions during the CBT phase predicted later changes in agoraphobic avoidance behavior. CONCLUSION: These data support the notion that therapeutic processes involved might be the same in VRET and exposure in vivo. However, given the slight superiority of exposure in vivo above VRET, the costs involved in the implementation of VRET and the lack of long‐term follow‐up, VRET cannot yet be recommended for patients with agoraphobia.

AB: Despite the introduction of alternative strategies for coronary heart disease management, the demand for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery continues to increase. Although advances in technology and peri‐operative care have resulted in rapid recovery, the earlier discharge following this major surgery leaves limited time for discharge teaching to patients who may not be cognitively or emotionally able to comprehend and retain the information. There is also consistent evidence that cardiac surgery patients experience a variety of health‐related issues following discharge. However the shortened length of stay has generally not been accompanied by an increased focus on follow‐up care. This randomized clinical trial (N = 200) compared the outcomes of a Nurse Practitioner (NP) Managed Postoperative Cardiac Surgery Follow‐up Clinic with the standard model of post‐discharge care for cardiac surgery patients (i.e., follow‐up with primary care physicians). Differences in outcomes (i.e., symptom status, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and healthcare costs) elicited via telephone interviews at two and six weeks post‐discharge will be discussed. Implications of the findings, including the ongoing development and refinement of this clinic, as well as further clinical and research strategies to improve health services and optimize outcomes for cardiac surgery patients, will be highlighted.

AB: Efficient methods for screening populations for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) are needed to reduce its associated mortality, morbidity, and costs. The use of digital technologies, including wearable sensors and large health record data sets allowing for targeted outreach toward individuals at increased risk for AF, might allow for unprecedented opportunities for effective, economical screening. The trial's primary objective is to determine, in a real‐world setting, whether using wearable sensors in a risk‐targeted screening population can diagnose asymptomatic AF more effectively than routine care. Additional key objectives include (1) exploring 2 rhythm‐monitoring strategies ‐ electrocardiogram‐based and exploratory pulse wave‐based ‐ for detection of new AF, and (2) comparing long‐term clinical and resource outcomes among groups. In all, 2,100 Aetna members will be randomized 1:1 to either immediate or delayed monitoring, in which a wearable patch will capture a single‐lead electrocardiogram during the first and last 2 weeks of a 4‐month period beginning immediately or 4 months after enrollment, respectively. An observational, risk factor‐matched control group (n = 4,000) will be developed from members who did not receive an invitation to participate. The primary end point is the incidence of new AF in the immediate‐ vs delayed‐monitoring arms at the end of the 4‐month monitoring period. Additional efficacy and safety end points will be captured at 1 and 3 years. The results of this digital medicine trial might benefit a substantial proportion of the population by helping identify and refine screening methods for undiagnosed AF.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To determine if an intervention consisting of telemonitoring and supervision by usual primary care clinicians of home self measured blood pressure and optional patient decision support leads to clinically important reductions in daytime systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled blood pressure. DESIGN: Multicentre randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 20 primary care practices in south east Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: 401 people aged 29‐95 years with uncontrolled blood pressure (mean daytime ambulatory measurement ≥ 135/85 mm Hg but ≤ 210/135 mm Hg). INTERVENTION: Self measurement and transmission of blood pressure readings to a secure website for review by the attending nurse or doctor and participant, with optional automated patient decision support by text or email for six months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blinded assessment of mean daytime systolic ambulatory blood pressure six months after randomisation. RESULTS: 200 participants were randomised to the intervention and 201 to usual care; primary outcome data were available for 90% of participants (182 and 177, respectively). The mean difference in daytime systolic ambulatory blood pressure adjusted for baseline and minimisation factors between intervention and usual care was 4.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.0 to 6.5; P=0.0002) and for daytime diastolic ambulatory blood pressure was 2.3 mm Hg (0.9 to 3.6; P=0.001), with higher values in the usual care group. The intervention was associated with a mean increase of one general practitioner (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 1.6; P=0.0002) and 0.6 (0.1 to 1.0; P=0.01) practice nurse consultations during the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Supported self monitoring by telemonitoring is an effective method for achieving clinically important reductions in blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension in primary care settings. However, it was associated with increase in use of National Health Service resources. Further research is required to determine if the reduction in blood pressure is maintained in the longer term and if the intervention is cost effective.

AB: In North Norway, no telemonitoring services for chronic heart failure (CHF) have yet been established, hence no investigations in the area have been published. However, large distances and a sparse population are causes for extra expenditure on hospital visits. In this paper, we describe the ePoint.telemed platform for home telemonitoring of CHF patients. We have reviewed the literature on home monitoring techniques, and developed two prototype platforms for remote collection of physiological data. We have refined one of the prototypes and subjected it to user testing among health professionals and their clients. Fifty patients will be involved in a randomized controlled trial aiming to establish if the home telemonitoring of CHF is clinically feasible and cost‐effective. The ePoint.telemed platform is a fully automated internet based system meant for early warnings in a CHF rehabilitation program. The core of the platform is a dashboard connected to a blood pressure meter, a weight scale, and a web‐based patient questionnaire. Unlike traditional systems built on dedicated medical equipment, we are applying easy‐to‐use components geared towards the sports market.

AB: Introduction: Telemedicine, the use of communication technologies for medical purpose is growing fast in the last years. In OSA telemedicine may be a promising tool over compliance in two particular groups of patient; 1) the non compliant to CPAP (less than 4 hours per day); and 2) the sub‐optimal users (4 to 5,5 h/d), as recent evidence suggests that clinical effects of CPAP treatment are mostly achieved with a use over 5,5‐5,6 hours (Barbe, AJRCCM 2010; Martinez‐Garcia, JAMA 2013). The aim of this trial is to compare our simple telemedicine intervention versus usual care group to rescue and optimize treatment, as determined by improvements on CPAP compliance as well as efficiency (respiratory events) and effectiveness (clinical consequences). This simple telemedicine system has been proved feasible on habitual Internet users as well as limited Internet users. Materials and methods: A prospective study were patients treated with CPAP for at least 3 months, after optimizing their initial CPAP treatment will be divided into 4 groups; Group 1) Rescue those with less than 4 h/ d compliance; Group 2) Optimize compliance on those with 4 to 5,5 h/d; using a telemonitoring intervention based on patients access to a especially designed mobile App, a 24‐hour voice mail recorder for consultations and monitoring of the signals received from their CPAP devices during a 6‐ weeks period; two parallel control groups will follow usual care. Main outcomes: CPAP compliance, residual events, and clinical consequences (Epworth Sleepiness Scale and 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring). And as secondary outcomes: morning BP, actigraphy (sleep efficiency) and nocturnal pulse‐oximetry (pulse rate variability) will also be monitored during 1 week, assessments will be performed at the beginning and after 6 weeks of follow up. Quality of life and satisfaction questionnaires; as well as cost‐analysis between groups will be analyzed. Results: In an ongoing project we have demonstrated the feasibility of the procedures, a positive repercussion in cost as well as the advantages of mobile Apps compared to web‐platforms (Suarez M.C. Sleep & Breathing Madison, 2017). Conclusions: The results of this study may provide a new simple strategy to improve and optimize CPAP compliance on OSA patients, and may inform future policy decisions regarding implementation of telemonitoring in OSA treatment. This aspect is not only important in treating symptoms (minimum compliance) but also in achieving optimal compliance which has been previously related to positive cardiovascular outcomes among others.

YR: 2015
KY: Carbon Monoxide; Nicotine
AB: Despite recent efforts to expand reach of smoking cessation treatment options beyond clinic based care, smoking cessation treatment including the use of smoking cessation aids remain greatly underutilized. If cessation programs are to have significant impact (Impact = Reach X Efficacy) on changing health behavior at the population level, there is a fundamental need to develop new and innovative strategies to increase treatment intensity, access, and participation. The use of intensive behavioral therapies, such as contingency management (CM), have demonstrated efficacy for reducing smoking in difficult‐to‐treat populations, but have had limited reach given the need to verify abstinence multiple times daily via clinic based monitoring. The development of a mobile health (mHealth) platform to provide CM has made the use of intensive CM approaches portable and feasible. The primary goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a proactive tele‐health intervention that combines evidenced based treatment for smoking cessation with smartphone based, portable contingency management on smoking rates. The central hypothesis is that increasing the intensity of available tele‐health smoking approaches through the addition of mobile CM will be an effective way to reduce smoking rates in Veterans returning from the Iraq/Afghanistan wars. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested in a comparative effectiveness trial with a two‐group design in which 260 Veteran smokers will be randomized to receive either an "mCM" intervention which combines evidence‐based cognitive‐behavioral telephone counseling (TC), a tele‐medicine clinic for access to nicotine replacement (NRT), and mCM administered through a smart phone or to a control condition that will provide controls for therapist, medication, time and attention effects. Specific aims are to evaluate (1) the impact of mCM on rates of abstinence from cigarettes as measured by bio‐verified, self‐reported prolonged abstinence at 3‐month, 6‐month, and 12 month post‐randomization follow‐up, (2) the relative cost‐effectiveness of the mCM intervention in quality adjusted life years (QALY), and (3) potential treatment mediators including self‐efficacy and treatment process mechanisms. The approach is innovative because it builds upon advances in mHealth technology and will be the first evaluation of smart phone based mobile CM in conjunction with other evidence‐based smoking cessation treatment for OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. There is a surprising lack of research aimed at evaluating multi‐component smoking cessation interventions that integrate CM with evidence‐based cognitive‐behavioral treatment and smoking cessation aids such as NRT. Cigarette smoking remains the most lethal substance use disorder in the United States and military veterans are at particular high risk for smoking related morbidity and mortality. The significance of identifying cost‐effective approaches to decreasing tobacco use in the relatively young and at‐risk cohort of returning Veterans could be tremendous as it will prevent significant morbidity and mortality.

AB: Objective: Barriers to executing large‐scale randomized controlled trials include costs, complexity, and regulatory requirements. We hypothesized that source document verification (SDV) via remote electronic monitoring is feasible. Methods: Five hospitals from two NIH sponsored networks provided remote electronic access to study monitors. We evaluated pre‐visit remote SDV compared to traditional on‐site SDV using a randomized convenience sample of all study subjects due for a monitoring visit. The number of data values verified and the time to perform remote and onsite SDV was collected. Results: Thirty‐two study subjects were randomized to either remote SDV (N=16) or traditional on‐site SDV (N=16). Technical capabilities, remote access policies and regulatory requirements varied widely across sites. In the adult network, only 14 of 2965 data values (0.47%) could not be located remotely. In the traditional on‐site SDV arm, 3 of 2608 data values (0.12%) required coordinator help. In the pediatric network, all 198 data values in the remote SDV arm and all 183 data values in the on‐site SDV arm were located. Although not statistically significant there was a consistent trend for more time consumed per data value (minutes +/‐ SD): Adult 0.50 +/‐ 0.17 min vs. 0.39 +/‐ 0.10 min (two‐tailed t‐test p=0.11); Pediatric 0.99 +/‐ 1.07 min vs. 0.56 +/‐ 0.61 min (p=0.37) and time per case report form: Adult: 4.60 +/‐ 1.42 min vs. 3.60 +/‐ 0.96 min (p=0.10); Pediatric: 11.64 +/‐ 7.54 min vs. 6.07 +/‐ 3.18 min (p=0.10) using remote SDV. Conclusions: Because each site had different policies, requirements, and technologies, a common approach to assimilating monitors into the access management system could not be implemented. Despite substantial technology differences, more than 99% of data values were successfully monitored remotely. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of remote monitoring and the need to develop consistent access policies for remote study monitoring. Copyright © 2013 Mealer et al.

AB: STATEMENT OF PROBLEMOR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): Can a 12 week program using text messaging and phone calls be used to adjust Lantus doses for type 2 insulin dependent diabetic patients of the Bellevue medical clinic? OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): In addition to evaluating the % of patients that reach their optimal Lantus dose in each arm, the MITI Study evaluates: 1. The feasibility of this type of study in a public hospital's outpatient medical clinic 2. If the intervention saves time and money 3. Patient satisfaction DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION, INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT (E.G. INPATIENT VS. OUTPATIENT, PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS): Remote Lantus insulin adjustment is appealing at a busy outpatient medicine clinic where appointment access can be limited and appealing to the low‐income patients served by our hospital who often have to miss hours of work, make arrangements for the children in their care, and arrange transportation in order to come for an in‐person clinic appointment. English or Spanish speaking patients in Bellevue's outpatient medical clinic who need their Lantus dose adjusted are randomized to two arms‐ the MITI intervention and usual care. MITI patients are enrolled in a secure web platform that texts them each weekday morning asking them to text back their fasting blood glucose. The MITI diabetes nurse reviews these numbers for alarm values daily. Each Thursday, the MITI diabetes nurse consults the (pre specified, MITI physician created) adjustment algorithms and calls patients advising them on Lantus dose titration. (When the diabetes nurse was unavailable on any given day of the study, the PI or coinvestigator reviewed for alarm values or made titration phone calls.) This process continues until the patients reach their optimal Lantus dose (defined as the Lantus dose that achieves one fasting blood glucose value less than or equal to 130, or the maximal dose of Lantus that can be safely given). Patients in the usual care group continue to come to in‐person titration visits in the manner specified by their primary medical doctor. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICS WHICH WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE PROGRAM/ INTERVENTION): Our study measures four main areas 1) Clinical Effectiveness: The number of patients in each arm (MITI vs. usual care) that reach their optimal Lantus dose in 12 weeks. 2) Feasibility: The% of text message responses, the ability of the MITI nurse to reach patients via phone calls, and the volume of time spent by theMITI nurse. 3) Cost savings: The time saved by patients in the MITI armis measured by the usual travel time to and from clinic, the time spent in the waiting room prior to each appointment, and the copays that accompany in person visits. 4) Satisfaction: Patient satisfaction is measured using the validated Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire at baseline and at 12 weeks. FINDINGS TODATE (IT ISNOT SUFFICIENT TOSTATE FINDINGSWILL BE DISCUSSED): We had a pilot grant for 2013 and again for 2014. Each pilot grant allowed about 6 months of the active intervention which allowed us to enroll patients and follow them for 12weeks. In 2013, 27 eligible patients enrolled in the MITI Study, 13 in the MITI arm and 14 in usual care: Clinical outcome: All 13 MITI patients reached their optimal Lantus dose within 12 weeks, while only 5 usual care patients reached their optimal Lantus dose (100 vs. 35.7 %, p=<0.001). Feasibility outcome: 82.7 % of our text messages were returned by patients. The nurse was able to reach patients with a single phone call 54 % of the time, spent an average of <5 min a day checking for alarmvalues, and spent an average of only 15 min on titration phone calls on Thursdays. Cost savings: Patients saved an average of 45 min of transportation time to and from the clinic, saved a $15 co‐pay for each visit, and the duration of the titration interaction was much shorter in the MITI arm (6 vs. 30 min for in‐person visit). The waiting room time was not measured in 2013 but is being measured in 2014. There was no increased utilization of Bellevue ER, walk‐in, or med refill visits for the MITI arm patients. Satisfaction: The 12 week Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire showed that MITI patients reported higher satisfaction (p= 0.03) Other: There were 8 cases of mild hypoglycemia (5MITI, 3 in Usual Care, BG 60‐ 79). There was no increased use of Bellevue Hospital services in the MITI arm. The analysis of the 2014 data is ongoing. Enrollment ended 12/12/14 and 12 week data collection for these 2014 patients will end in March 2015. [Thus far we can report that 14 of 15 2014 MITI patients reached their optimal Lantus dose (within the 12weeks of the trial). The 15th patient is still within her 12 weeks. Feasibility, Cost saving, and Satisfaction data will follow] KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TOTHEIR PRACTICE ORCOMMUNITY?): Remote Lantus adjustment is effective, feasible, cost saving and satisfactory. Lantus can be adjusted remotely using basic cell phone technology and a low cost web platform in the medical clinic of a large public hospital. This intervention helps ease the burden on demand for access in a busy clinic, and provides patient centered care for low‐income diabetic patients who have challenges coming to in‐person appointments.

AB: Introduction: Home‐based exercise training in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has the potential to improve CR uptake and decrease costs of CR. In addition, patients are expected to develop self‐management skills during home‐based CR, which will help them maintain an active lifestyle. The FIT@Home study evaluates physical fitness and physical activity levels after home‐based CR with telemonitoring guidance. In this interim analysis we discuss the long‐term results of home‐based CR on physical fitness. Methods: This randomized controlled trial compared the long‐term effects of a 12‐week home‐based (HB) training program with 12‐week centre‐based (CB) training program in low to moderate risk patients entering CR. The home‐based group (n=45) received three supervised training sessions, before they started training with a heart rate monitor in their home environment. They received individual coaching by telephone based on objective training data uploaded on the Internet. The CB group (n=45) received regular exercise of similar duration and intensity under direct supervision of a physical therapist. Physical fitness was assessed by a cardiopulmonary exercise test at baseline, 12 weeks and 1 year. Results: Preliminary short term results show that exercise adherence of the HB group (n=36) was similar to the supervised CB group (n=40) in the first 12 weeks (HB: training frequency of twice a week, intensity of 73.6% of HRmax). Patients in the HB and CB group showed a significant improvement in peakVO2 after 12 weeks training (14% and 11% respectively), without significant between‐group differences (p=0.75). By February 2015, 34 patients (HB=17; CB=17) had completed the long term assessment of physical fitness. In both groups, physical fitness levels were maintained one year after the start of CR, without a significant difference between groups (p=0.52). Conclusion: This study shows that HB training with telemonitoring guidance has similar short term effects on physical fitness as regular CB training in CR patients. Although data from only 34 patients were available, long term analysis indicate that both groups were able to maintain their physical fitness levels. This study demonstrates that home‐based cardiac rehabilitation is an effective alternative compared to regular centre‐based training for low to moderate cardiac risk patients.

AB: OBJECTIVES: (1) To determine if an asynchronous online model of teledermatology can provide similar or better clinical outcomes compared to conventional in‐office care for the management of psoriasis (2) To determine the effects of such a model on quality of life and patient satisfaction. METHODS AND POPULATION: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial comparing the clinical course of psoriasis patients followed in telemedicine clinic with those receiving traditional in‐office care. Following an initial baseline visit, sixty‐two subjects were randomized in a 1:1 non‐stratified fashion to continue follow up either in‐person or on‐line. Clinically validated, disease‐specific measures including the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), Investigator Global Assessment, and Dermatology Life Quality Index were assessed in‐person at the baseline and outcome visits for all patients. The study had a 90% power to detect a minimal clinically relevant mean difference of 2.5 points in the PASI, the primary outcome measure, with a standard deviation of 3 and an alpha of 0.05. RESULTS: We anticipate that compared to traditional in‐office care the online care model will result in similar improvements in psoriasis disease severity, quality of life and patient satisfaction. SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY: Studies suggest that teledermatology may improve patient satisfaction, reduce costs and improve access to dermatologic specialty care. The diagnostic accuracy and reliability of teledermatolgoy is similar to conventional care; however, comparability of clinical outcomes has not been well studied. Rigorous clinical outcomes research utilizing validated disease‐specific measures is required if this innovative health care delivery model is to be incorporated into standard clinical practice.

YR: 2012
KY: Heart Failure
AB: The incidence of acute decompensated heart failure is increasing. Patients with severe heart failure are rehospitalised for decompensation several times each year, increasing the cost for health care. In these cases of recurrent decompensation, the medical intervention in hospital is often limited to increasing the dosage of diuretics or vasodilators until the patient reaches a compensated state. After discharge, a readmission can be expected within a few months. A multidisciplinary approach by primary physician, heart failure nurse, rehabilitation team and cardiologist has been shown to decrease rehospitalisation rate and increase quality of life. Very recently, our study group showed that an intense collaboration between first line practitioner and heart failure clinic, facilitated by the use of telemonitoring, can reduce mortality and hospitalisation rate. This study was a RIZIV sponsored trial of 6 months follow‐up in patients with chronic heart failure. However, a large randomised multicentre trial investigating the use of telemonitoring in a population of heart failure (NYHA II‐III) patients did not find any difference between telemonitoring and usual care (Chaudry et al NEJM 2010). In contradiction with this study, a Cochrane meta‐analysis (Ingliss 2010) in more than 5000 patients confirmed our finding with a reduction in mortality and morbidity. The question therefore remains which factors are responsible for success or failure of the use of telemonitoring. Based on our previous experience, the approach of close monitoring by telemonitoring, with first line intervention by the patient's general practitioner (GP) and supervision by the heart failure clinic, might be the critical success factor. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate this model of telemonitoring‐assisted close supervision and interaction between first and second line health professionals versus a model of telemonitoring without this integrated approach.

AB: Background: Pain is often undertreated in an outpatient clinic. This trial tested the effectiveness of standardized education and telemonitoring in decreasing pain, distress, anxiety, and depression and improving the quality of life (QoL) and performance of outpatients with advanced cancers. Methods: A total of 108 patients were randomly assigned to receive standardized education (control arm, n=54) or standardized education plus telemonitoring (experimental arm, n=54). Nursing specialists provided video‐assisted educational material in both arm and daily telemonitoring for 1 week in the experimental arm. Assessment was performed at baseline and 1 week for pain (Brief Pain Inventory), distress (Distress Thermometer, DT), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), QoL (QLQ‐C30), and Karnofsky score. Results: Overall (n=108), pain was significantly improved in 1 week, including worst pain (7.3‐5.7, P<0.01), average pain (4.6‐3.8, P<0.01), and interference (5.7‐5.2, P<0.01). Other factors including anxiety (HADS score≥11, 75‐56%, P<0.01), depression (HADS score≥11, 73‐51 %, P< 0.01), QoL (QLQ‐C30 score, 2.77‐2.62, P<0.01), and Karnofsky score (32‐66, P<0.01) were also improved in 1 week. However, the level of distress (DT scale ≥4, 92‐87 %, P=0.27) was not recovered. Telemonitoring plus standardized education group showed a more significant pain improvement (portion of average pain≥5, 35 vs. 19 %, P=0.02). Conclusions: Standardized pain education using a nursing specialist is an efficient way to improve not only pain itself but also anxiety, depression, performance, and QoL. The addition of telemonitoring helps improve pain management, and telemonitoring is a simple and cost‐effective intervention in outpatients.

AB: Objective: Postoperative vascular discharge complications result in increased hospital readmissions, cost, and patient dissatisfaction. Telehealth technology to monitor patients, especially those in geographically isolated areas, should reduce postoperative complications and improve health and financial outcomes. The primary objective was to compare outcomes between patients who received telehealth electronic monitoring (THEM) and those with routine discharge instructions and no monitoring (standard of care). Methods: Thiswas a prospective randomized study of vascular surgery patients with groin incisions. THEMpatients received a tablet and homemonitoring devices that transmitted information to care managers. Monitoring tools includedimage capture,weight scales, bloodpressure cuffs, thermometers, and oxygen saturation monitors (Fig 1). Care managers used the TeleMed 2020 (Indianapolis, Ind) Enform platform to review alerts, real‐time patient data, and dialogue with the care team(Fig 2). Results: Thirty patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 16 (53.3%) were randomized to THEM and 14 (46.7%) to control groups. Average age and body mass index for THEM and control patients were similar (62.5 ± 7.2 years vs 65.7 ± 7.3 years [P = .234]; and 27.7 ± 4.3 kg/m2 vs 29.1 ± 7.1 kg/m2 [P = .487]). THEM patients had significantly more hypercholesterolemia (93.8% vs 50.0%; P = .012). There were no significant differences in wound or any 30‐day readmissions (6.3% vs 7.1% [P = 1.000]; and 25.0% vs 14.3% [P = .657]). Interestingly, 30‐day infection rates indicated care managers identified marginally more superficial wounds in the THEM group (31.3% vs 7.1%; P = .175). Both groups reported an increase in the 8‐Item Short Form Health Survey physical summary scores, but it was more pronounced in THEM patients (P = .076). THEM patients reported a significantly greater improvement in quality of life on two of the 8‐Item Short Form Health Survey quality subscales (roledphysical [THEM, 8.7; control, 1.1] and roleeemotional [THEM, 6.1; control, 0.5]; both P < .05). THEM patients reported trends for higher satisfaction in terms of general satisfaction, technical quality, and accessibility for Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form survey questions (4.2 vs 3.7 [P = .72], 4.5 vs 4.1 [P = .81], and 4.2 vs 3.8 [P = .63]), respectively. Conclusions: THEM was technically feasible and provided significant benefit to patients in geographically disparate areas. THEM was associated with increased patient satisfaction. Additional findings suggested that THEM patients embraced telehealth technology and took advantage of increased access to health care professionals. Telehealth successfully merged remotely generated information with care manager interaction. Presently, a larger study, preferably multicenter, is warranted and under consideration.

AB: Background: Telerehabilitation is an alternative way of delivering rehabilitation services. Information and communication technologies are used to facilitate communication between the healthcare professional and the patient in a remote location. The use of telerehabilitation is becoming more viable as the speed and sophistication of communication technologies improve. However, it is currently unclear how effective this model of delivery is relative to rehabilitation delivered face‐to‐face. Objectives: To determine whether the use of telerehabilitation leads to improved ability to performactivities of daily living amongst stroke survivors when compared with (1) in‐person rehabilitation (when the clinician and the patient are at the same physical location and rehabilitation is provided face‐to‐face); or (2) no rehabilitation. Secondary objectives were to determine whether use of telerehabilitation leads to greater independence in self care and domestic life and improved mobility, health‐related quality of life, upper limb function, cognitive function or functional communication when compared with in‐person rehabilitation and no rehabilitation. Additionally, we aimed to report on the presence of adverse events, cost‐effectiveness, feasibility and levels of user satisfaction associated with telerehabilitation interventions. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (November 2012), the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care Group Trials Register (November 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 11, 2012), MEDLINE (1950 toNovember 2012), EMBASE (1980 toNovember 2012) and eight additional databases.We searched trial registries, conference proceedings and reference lists. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of telerehabilitation in stroke. We included studies that compared telerehabilitation with inperson rehabilitation or no rehabilitation. In addition, we synthesised and described the results of RCTs that compared two different methods of delivering telerehabilitation services without an alternative group. We included rehabilitation programmes that used a combination of telerehabilitation and in‐person rehabilitation provided that the greater proportion of intervention was provided via telerehabilitation. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently identified trials on the basis of prespecified inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author moderated any disagreements. The review authors contacted investigators to ask for missing information. Main results: We included in the review 10 trials involving a total of 933 participants. The studies were generally small, and reporting quality was often inadequate, particularly in relation to blinding of outcome assessors and concealment of allocation. Selective outcome reporting was apparent in several studies. Study interventions and comparisons varied, meaning that in most cases, it was inappropriate to pool studies. Intervention approaches included upper limb training, lower limb and mobility retraining, case management and caregiver support. Most studies were conducted with people in the chronic phase following stroke. Primary outcome: no statistically significant results for independence in activities of daily living (based on two studies with 661 participants) were noted when a case management intervention was evaluated. Secondary outcomes: no statistically significant results for upper limb function (based on two studies with 46 participants) were observed when a computer programme was used to remotely retrain upper limb function. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of the intervention on mobility, health‐related quality of life or participant satisfaction with the intervention. No studies evaluated the cost‐effectiveness of telerehabilitation. No studies reported on the occurrence of adverse events within the studies. Authors' conclusions: We found insufficient evidence to reach conclusions about the effectiveness of telerehabilitation after stroke. Moreover, we were unable to find any randomised trials that included an evaluation of cost‐effectiveness. Which intervention approaches are most appropriately adapted to a telerehabilitation approach remain unclear, as does the best way to utilise this approach.

YR: 2011
AB: INTERVENTION: MiTii (“Move it To improve it”) is an internet‐based multimodal therapy which combines upper‐limb training within the context of meaningful physical activity that can be accessed in children's homes. Inherent in this approach is the ability to scaffold visual perception skills and cognitive challenge, both important aspects of activity engagement and participation in a virtual training environment. The program is potentially cost effective as only three centre‐based therapists (Physiotherapist, Occupation Therapist, and psychologist) are required to provide initial assessment, goal setting and training for families and participating children. Each therapist then spends 30 minutes each week to remotely modify the individualised program. This current application proposes to test the efficacy of MiTii in a wait list randomised controlled trial. We propose to provide MiTii at an intensity of 30 minutes per day, 6 days/week for 20 weeks (total dose 60 hours). All children will therefore receive the therapy within 10 months of being randomised either to commence MiTii immediately or waitlisted for 20 weeks before receiving the same Mitii therapy as the Immediate invention group. Retention of effects will be tested at 10 months. As current therapy programs are resource intensive and time consuming it is important to determine if gains from MiTii are sustained over a 10 month period as this could offer a cost effective model of care, particularly for rural, remote and isolated children with CP. CONDITION: Congenital Hemiplegia Cerebral Palsy PRIMARY OUTCOME: Motor and Process Skills in daily living activities as demonstrated by a 0.5 logit score on the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS) SECONDARY OUTCOME: Activity limitations (unimanual capacity and bimanual performance) by mean difference of 5 points on the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) and 10% decrease in time on the Jebsen‐Taylor Test of Hand Function (JTHF) Executive functioning (sustained attention, working memory and cognitive flexibility) Executive functioning in everyday life (measured by the BRIEF) Functioning and participation domains of quality of life (CP‐QOL‐child/CP‐QOL‐Teen) by 5 points on specified domains MiTii will be more cost‐effective compared with Usual Care as shown by resource use and effectiveness based on function (AMPs) and quality of life (CPQOL) MiTii will increase physical activity capability (measured using the functional strength assessments, walking tests and modified shuttle run test) and performance (measured using a physical activity questionnaire and accelerometers over >3 days) Neuroplasticity determined on the Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) curves using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) Occupational performance (COPM performance and satisfaction) by 2 points Participation (LIFE‐H) by 0.5 weighted score for categories of personal care, nutrition, education and recreation Visual perception (visual discrimination, visual memory and visual sequential memory) INCLUSION CRITERIA: i.

KY: Diabetes Mellitus
AB: Background: Diabetes is estimated to affect up to 1 in 5 VA patients overall and up to 1 in 4 racial/ethnic minority patients. Patients with low health literacy and minority groups have more difficulty communicating with physicians, report lower adherence to physicians' recommendations, and have higher rates of poor diabetes outcomes. Activating patients to use more effective communication with physicians' can lead to better adherence to treatment and to better biomedical outcomes. In this project the investigators build upon their prior work from two HSRD funded pilot projects to improve doctor patient communication in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In a previously funded short‐term project, SHP‐08‐182, the investigators conducted focus groups with patients with T2DM to elicit and understand from the patient perspective, barriers to communicating with their physician. This qualitative work was used in a subsequent pilot project, PPO‐08‐402 to refine and pilot test an educational video to encourage patients to use active participatory communication in their visits to physicians. This work was successfully completed and the product is a 10 minute video that in testing was found to be acceptable to patients and feasible for patients to view immediately preceding their medical encounter. Objectives: In this project the investigators propose to test the effectiveness of the video as an intervention to improved patients' communication. The primary aim is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of an intervention testing whether the intervention increases patients' active participatory communication behaviors, patients' post‐visit ratings of self efficacy to communicate, medication adherence, and diabetic control (HgbA1c). There are four secondary aims which include assessments of the (1) mediators, and (2) moderators of the relationship of the intervention condition to outcomes, (3) costs of the intervention, and (4) an evaluation of the feasibility of using the video for pre‐visit preparation. Methods: The investigators will conduct a two group, pre‐post, randomized controlled, single‐site trial of the intervention in patients with T2DM. The investigators will recruit 156 patients and their physicians for a pre and post‐intervention visit. Physicians will be trained with the agenda setting module from the Four Habits model. Patients will be randomized to view a 10 minute intervention or control video prior to their second visit. Visits will be audio recorded and analyzed for patients' and physicians' communication behaviors. Self‐efficacy to communicate will be collected by self report. Adherence will be collected by self‐report and by medication possession ratio. Diabetic control is collected by chart review. Analyses will evaluate the relationship of the intervention condition to outcomes, mediators and moderators of that relationship, and will estimate costs of the intervention and feasibility of using the video in a busy clinic. Impacts: VA transformation efforts including interprofessional Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) are focusing attention on patient‐centered care. Improved communication is a central feature of patient centered care. Communication in medical interactions is critical and plays an important, but often overlooked role in health‐care decision making and quality of care. Patients who have difficulty communicating are less involved in consultations with their physician, receive less information and support, and are less satisfied with their care. In turn, these patients may not understand their treatment options, may have less knowledge, less positive beliefs about treatment and less trust in physician, and may experience poorer health outcomes. Teaching patients to communicate more effectively is patient‐centered because it inherently supports a patient‐driven approach to delivering healthcare. The investigators' intervention is designed to encourage patients' active communication. Improving patients' communication is a unique focus that may supplement and add to the VA efforts in areas such as the Patient Aligned Care Team. In addition, the methodology is not disease specific and may be a paradigm for improvement in other conditions.

AB: Clinical goals of the VA CHF QUERI identify best practices to empower Veterans and their caregivers for HF self‐management. Recommendations of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association emphasize shared decision‐making. In the previous preliminary study, coding of actual recordings of Veterans speaking with HT nurse care coordinators provided evidence of best practices and areas for improvement for intervention development. The effect of the HT technology as a mediator of Veteran‐nurse communication requires particular re‐framing in communication skills training to promote shared decision‐making and self‐management as recommended. This quasi‐experimental study proposes the development of an evidence‐based intervention to enhance HT training tailored for more effective communication for HF self‐management and related outcomes. Goals: Phase 1 To conduct a pilot study as a quasi‐experimental trial at two VAMC HT sites to determine acceptability, actual use, implementation, practicality, integration, potential for expansion, effect sizes and limited efficacy for an HT‐specific communication skills intervention for HF Specific Aim 1.1a Development: Adapt components from the Rochester Participatory Decision‐Making Scale (RPAD) and recent advances in communication skills training for chronic disease to develop a valid and reliable intervention specific to HT shared decision‐making and telehealth communication using established best‐practices and Veteran input; Specific Aim 1.1b Training/Implementation: Implement the developed intervention at two VAMCs; Specific Aim 1.2Booster: Introduce an audit and feedback loop of HF self‐management outcomes for telehealth nurse practice as a booster to reinforce communication skills training. Phase 2 To compare changes in Veteran outcomes after a telehealth communication skills intervention with documented previous practice for differences in: a) shared decision‐making; b) Veteran perception of communication, education and self‐management for HF, c) quality of life, and d) health service utilization and related costs before and after intervention Specific Aim 2.1: Formative Evaluation: Nurses: Conduct anonymous surveys of knowledge of HF and self‐management strategies before and after training, qualitative interviews of reactions to the training course, and nurse care coordinator focus groups about the value of audit and feedback sessions after training. Specific Aim 2.2: Formative Evaluation: Veterans ‐ Phone record 25 Veterans with HF at two HT sites, for a total of 50 Veterans, speaking with nurse care coordinators before and after communication skills training followed by communication coding and discourse analysis. Specific Aim 2.3: Summative Evaluation: Compare shared decision‐making scores (SDM) measured by the RPAD, communication scores measured by the Four Habits Coding Scheme (FHCS), quality of life (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire), communication, education and self‐management in HF as measured by the Improving Chronic Illness Care Evaluation (ICICE) scale, and patient HF hospitalization use (admissions and emergency) and with pre‐training averages and with the post training averages at 1 and 3 months Rationale The technology of HT monitoring of Veterans with HF can inadvertently decrease participative communication consistent with shared decision‐making and HF self‐management. Application of communication skills training using evidence‐based coach role competencies promises to improve Veteran engagement and participation in the VA Home Telehealth service with increased self‐management and potential improvement in HF health service utilization. Improving engagement and participation in self‐management should result in a quantifiably better Veteran quality of life, a reduction in hospital and ED admissions, and thus, a decrease in health care utilization costs for the VA.

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03116958
YR: 2017
KY: Apnea; Sleep Apnea Syndromes; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Syndrome
AB: Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is defined by the presence of repetitive episodes of upper airways collapse during sleep, leading to nocturnal hypoxemia, sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness. When untreated, OSA is a risk factor for arterial hypertension , cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, road accidents and a worse quality of life. The application of a continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) represents the first line therapy in patients with moderate to severe OSA. CPAP treatment improves daytime sleepiness and oxygen saturation, reduces cardiovascular risk, ameliorates neurobehavioral performance, improves quality of life and reduces road accidents. Despite its demonstrated efficacy, CPAP effectiveness is significantly limited by poor adherence. A closer follow up could improve CPAP adherence but it would take up more work and additional costs for sleep units. So, on that account, the investigators propose a study to evaluate the effect of adding a telemedicine approach to traditional follow up on CPAP treatment compliance, patients' satisfaction and follow‐up costs. Telemedicine will be provided by an integrated platform composed by a web site (https://www.myosa.net/menu/login.aspx) and a smartphone application. Methods: Design: Prospective randomised clinical study. Follow up: 6 months. Participants: 60 patients diagnosed as OSA at St. Maria's Hospital (Sleep Unit) and requiring CPAP treatment. Randomization: Patients will be randomized into two groups differing in CPAP treatment management (standard care vs. telemedicine). Patients of both groups will be visited in Sleep Unit at 3st and 6th month after starting CPAP treatment. The CPAP machine of both groups will be provided with a modem sending daily information about CPAP treatment compliance and adherence to MyOSA web site (this kind of information will only be actively used during the follow‐up in the telemedicine group). Intervention: Group 1‐ Telemedicine Patients will be fitted with a mask , given a CPAP, and instructed on how to use the device. An intelligent software specifically developed for this project will be integrated in the web site. Using patients' baseline data (sociodemographic characteristics, presence of comorbidities, quality of life, sleepiness, pharmacologic treatment, toxic habits), the software will be capable to provide an initial prediction of the expected CPAP compliance at 6 months. Then, the real data about patients' treatment compliance sent on daily base by the CPAP machine will train the software improving the level of confidence of the prediction. Based on the prediction of compliance at six months, the software will provide specific and personalized interventions to modify or maintain this prediction. Interventions will be administered to the patients through a smartphone application connected to the web site and specifically developed for this study (MyOSA‐App). Using the mobile‐app patients will receive information about their own CPAP compliance and advice on how to improve compliance. All patients will be visited at 3 and 6 months at sleep unit. Patients will be checked about progress and adherence to therapy and any problems with their machine. Group 2‐ Standard care Patients will be fitted with a mask and given a CPAP and instructed on how to use the device. Each CPAP machine will be provided with a modem sending daily compliance and adherence information to MyOSA web site but no intervention based on these data is planned in this group. All patients will be visited at 1, 3 and 6 months at sleep unit. Patients will be checked about progress and adherence to therapy and any problems with their machine. Information will be downloaded from their machines (CPAP adherence, applied CPAP pressure, mask leak, and residual respiratory events…).

YR: 2015
AB: INTERVENTION: Patients aged 65 years and older, who are candidate for CR, but nut opting for regular CR are randomised in two study arms: the mCR programme for 6 months or no mCR programme. The mCR programme involves a home‐based programme for 6 months in which patients are supplied with a smartphone/application with a data subscription from MobiHealth. Through this application patients are able to measure and register physical activity, heart frequency and intensity (BORG scale) and can monitor progress. Patients are instructed to perform a moderate exercise 5 days per week for at least half an hour. A care professional (typically a CR nurse) also has access to a portal to monitor progress of different patients, advice on rehabilitation approach and stimulate compliance telephone calls. During the first month patients receive weekly individual coaching and feedback on their results by telephone, in the second month this will be once per two weeks, whereas one monthly call will be held in the last four months (month 3 until 6) of the mobile telemonitoring period. In the second period without mobile telemonitoring (month 7 until 12) patients will receive no coaching or feedback by phone. Patients participating in the control group with no mCR programme receive no advice or coaching throughout the study period. CONDITION: Cardiac rehabilitation, E‐health ; ; PRIMARY OUTCOME: Difference in peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) between the end of CR programme (T1) and baseline (T0).

Expected outcomes will be calculated based on historical data from patients with the same characteristics out of data from our administrative register. The expected outcomes will be compared with the actual from our intervention group. This method is inspired from a discontinuity regression model, which is an alternative when randomisation is not feasible due to logistic and ethical reasons. Therefore this is an intervention clinical study compared with expected outcomes. Study patients will report daily on various symptoms and measurement values (such as shortness of breath, cough, mucous, weight, blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation) and intake of p.r.n. medications, using a digital pen and a Health Diary form. The Health Diary form also allows free text messages from the patients. Healthcare personnel will monitor the system and incoming patient reports on a daily basis. Alarms will be generated if a patient reports values outside of predetermined limits or if a patient fails to send in reports. Patients will be asked to fill in the following questionnaires: (Swedish versions of) St George's Respiratory Questionnaire/Minnesota Living with heart failure questionnaire, the ED‐5Q questionnaire and the SF‐36 (at baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months), and eHealth Diary‐related questionnaires (at 1, 6 and 12 months).

AB: Introduction: Telemonitoring systems (TMS) for implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICD) are gaining attention as a strategy to optimize patient care, to save costs and to improve clinical outcome. This study prospectively investigated the influence of TMS on the levels of depression, QoL and device acceptance in ICD patients over a period of twelve months as impaired QoL is a common phenomenon in ICD patients. Methods: In this prospective randomized single‐center trial, 180 patients (82% male; age: 62.9 +/‐ 14.8; 47% with coronary artery disease, NYHA class 2.0+/‐0.7) were randomized at the day of ICD implantation to either telemonitoring (n=91) or control group (n=89). Patients in the intervention group were equipped with a TMS capable of transmitting device‐related data to our hospital. In the control group, only conventional in‐office followup (FU) visits were performed. Patients had to fill out three questionnaires (the generic EQ‐5D, the depression‐specific Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Florida Patient Acceptance Survey (FPAS)) at baseline; patients were followed‐up for twelve months, with postal surveys on a monthly basis. Results: Nine patients dropped out before survey completion at month six for different reasons. Of the remaining 171 patients 153 patients finished at least the 3‐months questionnaire and were included in the further analyses. The telemonitoring group showed a mean improvement in the health related QoL by 8.62 points after twelve months compared to baseline (p=.0234), while the QoL levels in the control group did not differ significantly vs. baseline over time. However, FPAS and HADS showed only a positive non‐significant trend for beneficial effects for the telemonitoring group. Notably, neither number of ICD shocks (inappropriate/appropriate) during follow‐up nor the baseline NYHA stadium had a significant influence on the levels of QoL, anxiety/depression or device acceptance over time. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the use of TMS seems to improve QoL of ICD patients over time. In addition, the results indicate marginal effects on the levels of depression, anxiety and device acceptance, which have to be further validated in larger patient cohorts with longer follow‐up periods.

YR: 2014
KY: Bupropion; Nicotine; Tobacco Use Disorder
AB: Cigarette smoking is the most lethal substance use disorder in the United States in terms of morbidity and mortality. Veterans who are homeless, along with those who have mental health or substance abuse problems, are at the highest risk for nicotine dependence. Prevalence estimates for smoking among homeless Veterans are 80%. Thus, homeless Veterans are at tremendous risk for smoking related morbidity and mortality. This information suggests that smoking needs to be targeted specifically among this high risk population of smokers. The addition of contingency management (CM) to existing evidence‐based tele‐health smoking cessation interventions is expected to be a cost‐effective way to increase the reach of intensive smoking cessation treatment. CM is a behavioral therapy that provides positive reinforcers to individuals misusing substances contingent upon objective evidence of abstinence from substance use. Because CM requires verification of abstinence multiple times daily with a clinic‐based carbon monoxide (CO) monitor, it has largely been relegated to inpatient and day treatment programs. The application of emerging smart phone technology, however, can overcome this barrier, and may be particularly well suited to homeless Veterans. The innovative smart phone application has made the use of CM for outpatient smoking cessation portable and feasible. The goal of this comparative effectiveness trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined tele‐health and mobile CM intervention that the investigators are calling Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy (ART). The investigators propose to screen 165 and randomize 126 homeless Veteran smokers to either: ABSTINENCE REINFORCEMENT THERAPY (ART), a tele‐health intervention that combines guideline‐based cognitive‐behavioral telephone (CBT) counseling, a tele‐medicine clinic for access to smoking cessation aids including choice of pharmacotherapy, and intensive behavioral therapy through mCM. VA SPECIALTY SMOKING CESSATION TREATMENT control, which includes all the elements associated with enrollment in a VA specialty smoking cessation clinic including group counseling, individual telephone counseling, self‐help materials, and smoking cessation aids including choice of pharmacotherapy. Specific aims are to: AIM 1: Evaluate the impact of ART on rates of abstinence from cigarettes as measured by bio‐verified, self‐reported prolonged abstinence at post‐treatment, and 3‐month and 6‐month post‐randomization follow‐ups. AIM 2: Evaluate the relative cost‐effectiveness of the ART intervention in quality adjusted life years (QALY). AIM 3: Evaluate potential treatment mediators including self‐efficacy‐related mechanisms. Supplementary AIM: To evaluate the impact of psychiatric (i.e., PTSD, depression and alcohol abuse) symptoms on treatment outcome across the two conditions.

AB: This study will compare the effects on health service use costs of tele‐rehabilitation‐supported physical therapy versus traditional home and/or clinic‐based physical therapy following total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. It will also examine standard post‐surgical clinical measures to confirm non‐inferiority of outcomes between groups. A total of 300 patients will receive standard pre‐ and post‐surgical medical care from their healthcare providers, and be randomized to receive pre‐surgery rehabilitation exercises ("pre‐hab") and post‐discharge physical therapy provided via either a home‐based tele‐rehabilitation platform (intervention group, n=150) or home‐health and clinic‐based physical therapy regimen (control group, n=150). Data will be collected by sites at enrollment, baseline, hospital discharge, and 6 weeks following surgery. Patients will complete telephone surveys regarding their health and knee function at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months after surgery. Patients will also keep a diary from hospital discharge through 3 months documenting healthcare utilization and progress toward a personal recovery goal. Diary information will be collected over the phone concurrently with administration of the 6‐week and 3‐month surveys. The episode for analysis will be from surgery through 3 months post‐discharge, in alignment with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) bundled payment model. Physical risks or benefits to patients for participating in this study are as expected from standard pre‐ and post‐surgical physical therapy associated with total knee replacement surgery. The low risk of loss of confidentiality for all subjects will be minimized using appropriate safeguards.

AB: The abstract below was inadvertently omitted from: A Regional Service Model of Teleconsultation For Planning And Treatment Of Complex Thoraco‐Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. Objectives: To report the methodology of a regional service model of teleconsultation for planning, and treatment of complex thoraco‐abdominal aortic aneurysm Methods: Complex thoraco‐abdominal aneurysms without a feasible conventional surgical repair are prospectively evaluated by expert vascular surgeons of the same health public provider (Public National Health System) dislocated in a huge area of 22.994kmC with 3,7 million of inhabitants and 11 tertiary hospitals. Surgeons evaluated CT scans and clinical details. Tele‐consultation is performed using a web conference service (web.conference.com; Avaya Inc., NJ, USA) with a monthly appointment. Results: Complex cases of thoraco‐abdominal aneurysms selected by each center were chosen for the difficult planning and/or operation. CT scans, planning of each cases were placed on a web platform (Google drive; Google Inc, CA, USA) and shared to all surgeons. Patient gave informed consent for the teleconsultation. The surgeon who submitted a case discusses in detail his/her case and prospects a possible endovascular/hybrid solution at the one‐month telemeeting. The other surgeons (at least 10) can suggest other solutions and alternative operative details in terms of graft, technique, or access to be used. Four/five cases are examined for the month session and different strategies of treatment are discussed between participants. Angiographic, operative, and clinical outcomes of the cases are then presented at the following telemeeting, and a final agreement of the operative strategy is evaluated. Conclusions: Such a regional service of teleconsulation may be of value in standardizing the treatment and derived costs of complex thoraco‐abdominal aortic aneurysms in a huge region under the same health provider.

AB: PURPOSE: While treatments and interventions for effective asthma management are well understood, asthma control continues to be suboptimal, resulting in frequent exacerbations, high healthcare utilization and costs, and decreased quality of life. Ambulatory monitoring of inhaled bronchodilators use through sensors and smartphone apps has the potential to improve self‐management and provide physicians with a new perspective on disease control. This report summarizes interim results, as measured by frequency of rescue inhaler use, from an ongoing clinical trial. METHODS: Patients at a hospital system in California are enrolled in a randomized, controlled trial, with allocation stratified by insurance type, language (Spanish or English) and level of control. Intervention group participants receive inhaler sensors and feedback through smartphone apps and online interfaces. Intervention patients' physicians receive access to this data, and alerts if a patient falls below control thresholds. Control group patients are outfitted with sensors but do not receive feedback. RESULTS: At 16 weeks, 216 patients (107 intervention, 99 control) had been enrolled (49% of 440 person target). At enrollment, the mean number of events per week did not differ (p=0.70) between control (3.55 ±5.74) and intervention groups (3.23 ±6.58). In a linear mixed model, over the first 60 days of participation the intervention group used their inhaler 0.14 times fewer per day or 1 event per week (p = 0.046) fewer when compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Remote monitoring of rescue inhaler use provides information valuable to guide and improve self‐management and may help physicians identify patients who need more attention. Subsequent analyses will investigate any effects on healthcare utilization.

AB: Introduction: Because OSA is a prevalent disease with significant morbidity and high costs for health system, new strategies for its management are needed. TM is a potentially useful procedure requiring clinical evaluation. Objective: To assess TM approach (virtual sleep unit) for full management of OSA compared with traditional face‐to‐face procedure in terms of clinical improvement and compliance. Methods: A 3 month randomized controlled trial was performed to compare a TM‐based strategy (G1) with conventional hospital management (G2). Subjects with OSA suspicion and with internet skills were enrolled (n, 186). G1 included 3 home respiratory polygraphies (HRP) for diagnosis as well as videoconferences for remote interaction with patients. If CPAP was needed, an automatic device with daily data transmission was used. G2 included full management at the hospital. Depending on physician criteria, PSG or HRP was used for diagnosis or titration and fixed CPAP was used for treatment. Results: G1: 94 patients were included (Age 50.3±11.3yr, BMI 29.9±6.1kg/m2); 83% had OSA diagnosis and 34% with CPAP treatment. G2: 92 patients were included (Age 50.8±12.1yr, BMI 31.5±10.9kg/m2); 77% with OSA diagnosis and 44% with CPAP treatment. At the end of the study no differences were found in the Epworth Scale (G1 9.9±4.3 vs G2 8.5±4.4). In patients requiring CPAP; compliance was 5.7±1.4 and 5.6± 1.6 h/night respectively; p>0.05). Side effects and degree of satisfaction were similar in both groups. Conclusion: Our TM‐based strategy for management of OSA was as effective as conventional hospital‐based care in terms of CPAP compliance and symptom improvement.

AB: Objectives: Computer‐administered cognitive‐ behavioural therapy (CCBT) may be a promising treatment for adolescents with depression, particularly due to its increased availability and accessibility. The feasibility of delivering a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a CCBT program (Stressbusters) with an attention control (self‐help websites) for adolescent depression was evaluated. Design: Single centre RCT feasibility study. Setting: The trial was run within community and clinical settings in York, UK. Participants: Adolescents (aged 12‐18) with low mood/depression were assessed for eligibility, 91 of whom met the inclusion criteria and were consented and randomised to Stressbusters (n=45) or websites (n=46) using remote computerised single allocation. Those with comorbid physical illness were included but those with psychosis, active suicidality or postnatal depression were not. Interventions: An eight‐session CCBT program (Stressbusters) designed for use with adolescents with low mood/depression was compared with an attention control (accessing low mood self‐help websites). Primary and secondary outcome measures: Participants completed mood and quality of life measures and a service Use Questionnaire throughout completion of the trial and 4 months post intervention. Measures included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (primary outcome measure), Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ), Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS), the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (youth) (EQ‐5D‐Y) and Health Utility Index Mark 2 (HUI‐2). Changes in self‐reported measures and completion rates were assessed by treatment group. Results: From baseline to 4 months post intervention, BDI scores and MFQ scores decreased for the Stressbusters group but increased in the website group. Quality of life, as measured by the EQ‐5D‐Y, increased for both groups while costs at 4 months were similar to baseline. Good feasibility outcomes were found, suggesting the trial process to be feasible and acceptable for adolescents with depression. Conclusions: With modifications, a fully powered RCT is achievable to investigate a promising treatment for adolescent depression in a climate where child mental health service resources are limited.

AB: PURPOSE: The prevalence of obesity in rural and remote areas is elevated in comparison to urban populations, highlighting the need for interventions targeting obesity prevention in these settings. Implementing evidence‐based obesity prevention programs is challenging. This study aimed to investigate factors influencing the implementation of obesity prevention programs, including adoption, program delivery, community uptake, and continuation, specifically within rural settings. METHODS: Nested within a large‐scale randomized controlled trial, a qualitative exploratory approach was adopted, with purposive sampling techniques utilized, to recruit stakeholders from 41 small rural towns in Australia. In‐depth semistructured interviews were conducted with clinical health professionals, health service managers, and local government employees. Open coding was completed independently by 2 investigators and thematic analysis undertaken. FINDINGS: In‐depth interviews revealed that obesity prevention programs were valued by the rural workforce. Program implementation is influenced by interrelated factors across: (1) contextual factors and (2) organizational capacity. Key recommendations to manage the challenges of implementing evidence‐based programs focused on reducing program delivery costs, aided by the provision of a suite of implementation and evaluation resources. Informing the scale‐up of future prevention programs, stakeholders highlighted the need to build local rural capacity through developing supportive university partnerships, generating local program ownership and promoting active feedback to all program partners. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that the rural workforce places a high value on obesity prevention programs. Our results inform the future scale‐up of obesity prevention programs, providing an improved understanding of strategies to optimize implementation of evidence‐based prevention programs.

AB: Background: Maternal mortality, although largely preventable, remains unacceptably high in developing countries such as Malawi and creates a number of intergenerational impacts. Few studies have investigated the far‐reaching impacts of maternal death beyond infant survival. This study demonstrates the short‐ and long‐term impacts of maternal death on children, families, and the community in order to raise awareness of the true costs of maternal mortality and poor maternal health care in Neno, a rural and remote district in Malawi. Methods: Qualitative in‐depth interviews were conducted to assess the impact of maternal mortality on child, family, and community well‐being. We conducted 20 key informant interviews, 20 stakeholder interviews, and six sex‐stratified focus group discussions in the seven health centers that cover the district. Transcripts were translated, coded, and analyzed in NVivo 10. Results: Participants noted a number of far‐reaching impacts on orphaned children, their new caretakers, and extended families following a maternal death. Female relatives typically took on caregiving responsibilities for orphaned children, regardless of the accompanying financial hardship and frequent lack of familial or governmental support. Maternal death exacerbated children's vulnerabilities to long‐term health and social impacts related to nutrition, education, employment, early partnership, pregnancy, and caretaking. Impacts were particularly salient for female children who were often forced to take on the majority of the household responsibilities. Participants cited a number of barriers to accessing quality child health care or support services, and many were unaware of programming available to assist them in raising orphaned children or how to access these services. Conclusions: In order to both reduce preventable maternal mortality and diminish the impacts on children, extended families, and communities, our findings highlight the importance of financing and implementing universal access to emergency obstetric and neonatal care, and contraception, as well as social protection programs, including among remote populations.

AB: Interactive game‐based systems, such as Wii FitO, represent innovative technologies potentially able to increase the effectiveness of Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programmes (PRP). Aim: to evaluate the effectiveness of interactive game‐based exercises in addition to PRP. Twenty six patients with chronic lung disease (17 COPD), undergoing a 3 week PRP were prospectively enrolled and randomly submitted to the usual PRP (Control Group: CG) or to PRP + 7 sessions of exercises with Wii FitO including Yoga, Muscle Exercises, Aerobic Exercises, and Training Plus (Study Group: SG). Before (T0) and after PRP (T1) we evaluated: maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure (MIP, MEP), dyspnoea (MRC and Borg Scale), fatigue (Borg Scale), Six‐Minute Walking Test (6MWT), leg‐ and arm‐cycle ergometry, Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Baseline (BDI) and Transitional (TDI) dyspnoea index. As expected, both groups showed a significant improvement in exercise tolerance, dyspnoea and health status. In SG compared to CG were found: 1) A greater improvement in dyspnoea as assessed by TDI (3.9+/‐1.5 vs. 2.4+/‐1.0, respectively; p=0.01) 2) A reduced dyspnoea (4.5+/‐1.0 vs. 6.3+/‐1.3; p=0.003) and fatigue (5.4+/‐1.6 vs. 6.8+/‐1.4; p=0.04) during arm exercise Rehabilitation treatment with Wii Fit O balance board can be useful as an additional tool to standard PRP in improving dyspnoea and arm exercise tolerance in chronic pulmonary disease. Practical advantages include ability to train at home with or without remote supervision, enjoyability, real‐time feedback on performance, healthcare costs reduction. Larger prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm these preliminary results.

KY: Hodgkin Disease; Lymphoma; Lymphoma, Large B‐Cell, Diffuse; Lymphoma, T‐Cell
AB: Lymphoma is the 6th cancer in terms of incidence in France where approximately 11,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Most types of lymphomas occur at all ages with a predominance in elderly subjects. With the continuous improvement of the diagnostic techniques and the treatments, the prognosis of lymphomas is constantly improving. However, 20‐40% of patients relapse most often within 2 or 3 years after the end of treatment. The current standard follow up includes a clinical examination and a biological check‐up every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months up to 5 years and an imaging every 6 months. However, the interest of this systematic surveillance by imaging is controversial. The use of new information and communication technologies, can improve the clinical follow‐up of patients. To date, access to the Internet and portable technologies is sufficiently broad and democratized to envisage the use of this type of remote surveillance in the field of health. In particular to facilitate the dissemination of information between the patient and the physician. It is thus possible to imagine using this flow of information to generate alerts. Strengthening the clinical follow‐up in this indication, in which routine imaging has not demonstrated their interest, in particular by the implementation of remote monitoring completed by the patient, may present an advantage in terms of effectiveness and precocity of care. In this pathology, up to 40% of patients relapse early (within 2 to 3 years), in the vast majority of cases symptomatically (less than 2% asymptomatic relapse discovered by imaging). Finally the CT scan every 6‐month , which generates radiation costs and exposures for a relatively low benefit, is performed in symptomatic patients since several weeks. The aim of this study is to evaluate the interest of a web‐mediated follow up using a score based on the dynamics and the association of clinical and biological signs to alert the physician of a possible recurrence of the patients treated for a lymphoma in complete or partial response.

AB: BACKGROUND: COPD is a highly complex disease to manage as patients show great variation in symptoms and limitations in daily life. In the last decade self‐management support of COPD has been introduced as an effective method to improve quality and efficiency of care, and to reduce healthcare costs. Despite the urge to change the organisation of health care and the potential of eHealth to support this, large‐scale implementation in daily practice remains behind, especially in the Netherlands. METHODS/DESIGN: We designed a multilevel study, called e‐Vita, to investigate different organisational implementation methods of a self‐management web portal to support and empower patients with COPD in three different primary care settings. Using a parallel cohort design, the clinical effects of the web portal will be assessed using an interrupted times series (ITS) study design and measured according to changes in health status with the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). The different implementations and net benefits of self‐management through eHealth on clinical outcomes will be evaluated from human, organisational, and technical perspectives. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge this is the first study to combine different study designs that enable simultaneous investigation of clinical effects, as well as effects of different organisational implementation methods whilst controlling for confounding effects of the organisational characteristics. We hypothesize that an implementation with higher levels of personal assistance, and integrated in an existing care program will result in increased use of and satisfaction with the platform, thereby increasing health status and diminishing exacerbation and hospitalisation.

AB: Aim: To analyse differences in glycaemic control between subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) treatment who where included in a telecare (TC) program, and subjects with T1DM on CSII treatment who received conventional care (CC). Methods: Cross‐over randomized clinical trial with a duration of 18 months. Thirty‐six patients were included. Participants were randomly assigned to receive TC program or CC during 6 months; after a 3 months wash‐out period, patients changed to CC or to TC. TC program included monthly visits using an Internet platform. CC comprised face‐to‐face visits every three months. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected, HbA1c was measured at the beginning and end of TC and CC. Results: Thirty‐six patients were included: 33.3% men, mean age was 39.3 +/‐ 10.6 yrs. Mean HbA1c was significantly higher after TC intervention (7.05 vs. 7.20%, p = 0.019), whereas it did not change after CC (7.47 vs. 7.49%, p = 0.51). Insulin needing was reduced after TC (0.63 vs. 0.60 UI/kg/day, p = 0.007), as well as the low blood glucose index did (4.5 vs. 3.6, p = 0.007). Standard deviation of glucose decreased after CC (78 vs. 70 mg/dL, p = 0.03). No differences in mean glucose, episodes of mild hypoglycaemia, severe hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and ketosis were found in both programs. Conclusions: Although no improvement on HbA1c after TC intervention was observed; a significantly reduction in a hypoglycaemic risk scale and no differences in other glycaemic control parameters might show the role of telemedicine in diabetes care. Studies that included quality of life and costs analysis are needed.

AB: BACKGROUND: Recruitment of study participants is a challenging process for health professionals and patients. The Translational Medicine and Patient Safety in Europe (TRANSFoRm) clinical trial tools enable automated identification, recruitment and follow‐up in clinical trials, potentially saving time, effort and costs for all parties involved. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the acceptability and feasibility of TRANSFoRm to improve clinical trial recruitment in primary care. METHODS: A feasibility study was conducted in three general practices in Poland. Participants were physicians and patients with gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease. Semi‐structured interviews were held to obtain feedback about the usefulness, ease of use and overall experience with the TRANSFoRm tools and to identify potential usability issues. Data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: A total of 5 physicians and 10 patients participated in the study. Physicians were satisfied with the usefulness of the system, as it enabled easier and faster identification, recruitment and follow‐up of patients compared with existing methods. Patients found the TRANSFoRm apps easy to use to report patient outcomes. However, they also felt that the apps may not be useful for patients with limited exposure to smartphone and web technologies. Two main usability issues were identified: physicians could not access the result of the randomization at the end of each visit, and participants could not locate the follow‐up reminder email. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new evidence on the acceptability and feasibility of TRANSFoRm to enable automated identification, recruitment and follow‐up of study participants in primary care trials. It also helps to better understand and address users' requirements in eHealth‐supported clinical research.

AB: Background: Medication nonadherence affects health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Concepts from behavioral economics can guide the development of interventions to improve medication adherence. Objective: To measure the relative effectiveness of 2 behavioral economic‐based incentive structures to improve medication adherence. Methods: This randomized controlled trial compared adherence among participants taking antihypertensive or antihyperlipidemic medications randomized to usual care (UC), guaranteed pay‐out (GPO) incentives, or lottery incentives. Daily adherence was measured over a 90‐day period using electronic caps (Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS]). The GPO group received $30 up‐front in a virtual account, with $0.50 deducted for each missed dose. Lottery group participants were eligible for a weekly $50 drawing, but only if they had taken their medication as prescribed all week. An electronic survey assessed self‐reported adherence. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, paired t tests, ANOVA, and Pearson's correlations. Results: In all, 36 participants were randomized (UC, n = 11; GPO, n = 14; lottery, n = 11). Mean percentage (+/‐SD) of days adherent during the incentive period was highest in the lottery group (96% +/‐ 5%), followed by the GPO group (94% +/‐ 9%) and the UC group (94% +/‐ 9%). There were no statistically significant differences among groups (P > 0.05). MEMS‐measured adherence was not significantly correlated with a patient's self‐reported adherence (P > 0.05) at baseline but was correlated at 90‐day follow‐up (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Although no statistically significant differences in adherence were demonstrated in this small sample of highly adherent participants, larger studies in a more diverse population or with other medications might show otherwise.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Hospital readmissions within 30 days are a healthcare quality problem associated with increased costs and poor health outcomes. Identifying interventions to improve patients' successful transition from inpatient to outpatient care is a continued challenge. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single‐centre pragmatic randomised and controlled clinical trial examining the effectiveness of a discharge follow‐up phone call to reduce 30‐day inpatient readmissions. Our primary endpoint is inpatient readmission within 30 days of hospital discharge censored for death analysed with an intention‐to‐treat approach. Secondary endpoints included observation status readmission within 30 days, time to readmission, all‐cause emergency department revisits within 30 days, patient satisfaction (measured as mean Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores) and 30‐day mortality. Exploratory endpoints include the need for assistance with discharge plan implementation among those randomised to the intervention arm and reached by the study nurse, and the number of call attempts to achieve successful intervention delivery. Consistent with the Learning Healthcare System model for clinical research, timeliness is a critical quality for studies to most effectively inform hospital clinical practice. We are challenged to apply pragmatic design elements in order to maintain a high‐quality practicable study providing timely results. This type of prospective pragmatic trial empowers the advancement of hospital‐wide evidence‐based practice directly affecting patients. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Study results will inform the structure, objective and function of future iterations of the hospital's discharge follow‐up phone call programme and be submitted for publication in the literature.

AB: Quality control (QC) is an essential component of point‐of‐care testing programs. In the context of a randomised‐controlled trial (TTANGO) using GeneXpert (Xpert) Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (CT/NG) point‐of‐care testing in remote areas of Australia, we aimed to develop and utilise a stable positive control material. Bacterial cultures of CT and NG were resuspended together to provide cycle threshold (Ct) values of approximately 25 cycles for both CT and NG when tested on the Xpert CT/NG assay. These positive control suspensions were dried in aliquots, heat inactivated, and then provided to 12 participating health services as research‐only QC samples in kit form. At each service, a QC sample was resuspended and tested each month on the Xpert. QC results, including Xpert Ct values, were analysed from each site over 30 months and we calculated costs per QC sample. Overall, at 12 health services there were 89 QC samples tested (average of 8 tests per site per year). Mean Ct values for the 89 controls samples were 25.25 cycles (SD = 1.15) for CT, 24.04 cycles (SD = 1.400) for one NG target and 23.35 cycles (SD = 1.55) for the other NG target. No significant differences in Ct value for CT or NG controls were observed over a trial period of 30 months. Positive QC samples for research use in a trial of a molecular point‐of‐care assay were inexpensive to produce and stable when stored at 2‐8°C. For routine use, additional requirements such as meeting National Association of Testing Authority (NATA) regulations and Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approval will need to be achieved.

AB: Background: COPD Patients with acute exacerbations are frequently admitted to emergency wards causing the patients to feel anxiety, loss of control and stress, and also causing considerable healthcare costs for the society. Aim: We investigated whether patients with COPD exacerbations admitted to a hospital could avoid further admittance and safely be treated at home by means of telemedicine technology (TT). Methods: Fifty‐seven patients with severe COPD, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and consented to participate within 24 hours of a hospital admission, were randomised to receive either standard treatment at the hospital or standard treatment at home using TT. The equipment consisted of a video conference system and a webcam, measuring equipment (spirometer, thermometer, and pulsoximeter), 24 hour online web‐service, access to oxygen, nebulizer and medical therapy. Two university hospitals participated. Readmission within 30 days after discharge was selected as primary outcome. Results: Twenty‐nine patients were allocated to the TT group and 28 patients received usual care in the hospital. There were 10 readmissions in each group involving eight patients in the TT group and six patients in the control group. Readmission rate was 27, 6% (95% CI 11, 3 to 43, 9) in the TT group and 21,4% (95% CI 6,2 to 36,6) in the conventional group. No statistically significant differences between groups in readmission rate, use of antibiotics or systemic steroids were seen. No deaths occurred during the study period. Conclusion: We propose that a considerable segment of patients with COPD exacerbations admitted to hospital can be safely treated at home using the TT solution.

AB: BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence affects health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Concepts from behavioral economics can guide the development of interventions to improve medication adherence. OBJECTIVE: To measure the relative effectiveness of 2 behavioral economic‐based incentive structures to improve medication adherence. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial compared adherence among participants taking antihypertensive or antihyperlipidemic medications randomized to usual care (UC), guaranteed pay‐out (GPO) incentives, or lottery incentives. Daily adherence was measured over a 90‐day period using electronic caps (Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS]). The GPO group received $30 up‐front in a virtual account, with $0.50 deducted for each missed dose. Lottery group participants were eligible for a weekly $50 drawing, but only if they had taken their medication as prescribed all week. An electronic survey assessed self‐reported adherence. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, paired t tests, ANOVA, and Pearson's correlations. RESULTS: In all, 36 participants were randomized (UC, n = 11; GPO, n = 14; lottery, n = 11). Mean percentage (±SD) of days adherent during the incentive period was highest in the lottery group (96% ± 5%), followed by the GPO group (94% ± 9%) and the UC group (94% ± 9%). There were no statistically significant differences among groups (P > 0.05). MEMS‐measured adherence was not significantly correlated with a patient's self‐reported adherence (P > 0.05) at baseline but was correlated at 90‐day follow‐up (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistically significant differences in adherence were demonstrated in this small sample of highly adherent participants, larger studies in a more diverse population or with other medications might show otherwise.

AB: BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence‐based treatment for alcohol use disorders (AUDs), yet is rarely implemented with high fidelity in clinical practice. Computer‐based delivery of CBT offers the potential to address dissemination challenges, but to date there have been no evaluations of a web‐based CBT program for alcohol use within a clinical sample. METHODS: This study randomized treatment‐seeking individuals with a current AUD to 1 of 3 treatments at a community outpatient facility: (i) standard treatment as usual (TAU); (ii) TAU plus on‐site access to a computerized CBT targeting alcohol use (TAU + CBT4CBT); or (iii) CBT4CBT plus brief weekly clinical monitoring (CBT4CBT + monitoring). Participant alcohol use was assessed weekly during an 8‐week treatment period, as well as 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. RESULTS: Sixty‐eight individuals (65% male; 54% African American) were randomized (TAU = 22; TAU + CBT4CBT = 22; CBT4CBT + monitoring = 24). There were significantly higher rates of treatment completion among participants assigned to 1 of the CBT4CBT conditions compared to TAU (Wald = 6.86, p < 0.01). Significant reductions in alcohol use were found across all conditions within treatment, with participants assigned to TAU + CBT4CBT demonstrating greater increases in percentage of days abstinent (PDA) compared to TAU, t(536.4) = 2.68, p < 0.01, d = 0.71, 95% CI (0.60, 3.91), for the full sample. Preliminary findings suggest the estimated costs of all self‐reported AUD‐related services utilized by participants were considerably lower for those assigned to CBT4CBT conditions compared to TAU, both within treatment and during follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of web‐based CBT4CBT targeting alcohol use. CBT4CBT was superior to TAU at increasing PDA when delivered as an add‐on, and it was not significantly different from TAU or TAU + CBT4CBT when delivered with clinical monitoring only.

AB: Background: Intensive care medicine is challenged by demographic changes and an increasing number of patient combined with existing shortage of doctors. Telemedicine is a promising approach to ensure patient care in the coming years. Due to a shortage of intensive care physicians in the USA, comprehensive telemedicine coverage has already been established. To date, 11 % of all hospitals are supported by a telemedicine center. The beneficial impact in terms of quality of care, patient safety and economic factors has been confirmed in numerous multicenter studies. Results: In the largest multicenter study by Lilly et al., including 107,432 critically ill patients in the intervention group, telemedicine interventions led to a reduced ICU and hospital mortality. In addition, tele‐consulting significantly reduced the ICU‐ and hospital length of stay. These findings were further supported by following studies and metaanalysis, which confirmed these results. The incidence of ventilator‐associated pneumonia and catheter‐associated infections was significantly reduced, when compared to the preintervention group. Furthermore, patient safety and treatment outcomes were improved by increased guideline adherence. Last, the telemedicine intervention significantly decreased the overall treatment costs. These positive results were reproducible even in larger and academic hospitals. At the same time it should be pointed out that a transfer to other health care systems should be considered cautiously in the context of different local infrastructure and culture. Finally, it has to be investigated to what extent the results can be transferred to the health‐care situation in Germany. Conclusion: Previous data demonstrated that telemedical support can improve the outcome in critically ill patients, both during hospitalization as well as in the long‐term result until the discharge home. Telemedicine is neither a magic bullet nor a replacement for a physician. Instead it is a new type of medical cooperation to further improve the outcomes of critically ill patients.

AB: OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the impact of an Internet‐based telematic system on the economic and clinical management of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 6‐month prospective, randomized, comparative, open, multicenter study included patients with type 1 diabetes >18 years old treated with multiple insulin doses and with a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of >8%. We compared an intervention group (IG) (two face‐to‐face and five telematic appointments) with a control group (CG) (seven face‐to‐face appointments). The variables studied were (1) patient and healthcare team costs, (2) metabolic control, (3) knowledge of diabetes, (4) quality of life, and (5) self‐care treatment adherence. RESULTS: Of the 154 patients included, 118 (76.6%) completed the study (IG, 54; CG, 64). The time used by the CG to follow the program was 823±645 min versus 353±222 min in the IG (P<0.0001). Compared with the CG, the IG required less healthcare time from the professionals (288±105 min vs. 232±89 min; P<0.001). HbA1c improved in both groups (IG, 9.2±1.5% [77.0±17.0 mmol/mol] vs. 8.7±1.5% [71.6±17.0 mmol/mol] [P<0.001]; CG, 9.2±0.9% [77.0±10.0 mmol/mol] vs. 8.6±0.9% [70.5±10.0 mmol/mol] [P<0.001], as did knowledge and self‐care treatment adherence. CONCLUSIONS: The use of interactive telematic appointments in subjects with type 1 diabetes and inadequate metabolic control is an efficient strategy, providing results comparable to those of face‐to‐face appointments in relation to improvement in glycemic control, knowledge acquisition, and self‐care treatment adherence, with a significant reduction in the time used, especially by patients.

AB: Background: IBD affects 1.6 million people in the US and is associated with increased healthcare utilization. Telemedicine is an alternative healthcare delivery system which could improve outcomes and decrease costs. The objective of this study was to compare healthcare utilization 1 year before and after randomization among participants receiving TELE‐IBD and standard care. Methods: The TELE‐IBD study was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial conducted over 1 year. Controls received standard care whereas TELE‐IBD participants completed testing with TELE‐IBD weekly (W) or every other week (EOW). Testing consisted of an assessment of symptoms, side effects, and weight, alerts to providers, action plans to participants, and educational messages. Healthcare utilization was assessed by review of the electronic medical record and categorized as office and emergency department visits, diagnostic tests, infusions, procedures and hospitalizations. Results: Total encounters increased in all groups after enrollment; increased utilization was due to significant increases in office visits, infusions, and telephone encounters (Table 1). There was no difference in total encounters between groups. Telephone calls increased significantly from baseline in TELE‐IBD EOW and W; however, the difference was not significant between groups. IBD‐related hospitalizations increased in controls (22 to 26) but decreased from 27 to 16 in TELE‐IBD EOW and 27 to 11 in TELE‐IBD W respectively (TELE‐IBD W vs. controls, p <.05). Conclusion: Healthcare utilization increased in all groups and was not decreased with use of TELE‐IBD. However, use of TELE‐IBD W was associated with a significant decrease in IBD‐related hospitalizations. Despite more frequent interactions with the care team in TELE‐IBD groups, telephone and electronic communications were not increased compared to standard care. Further research is needed to determine if telemedicine can be used to decrease healthcare utilization. (Table presented).

AB: We assessed a two‐stage follow‐up procedure for cardiac pacemakers, where in‐clinic follow‐ups were partly replaced by telemedical follow‐ups. This was compared with the standard follow‐up regime (in‐clinic follow‐up only). The new procedure required an electronic patient record, a telemedical follow‐up unit for recording ECGs while the pacemaker was temporarily set to magnet mode, an ECG processing unit, and a reviewing and reporting unit. A total of 177 (86 female) patients were randomized to the control group and 182 (98 female) patients to the telemedicine group. In the telemedicine group, 234 telemedical follow‐ups were performed. Out of these, 68 required an additional in‐clinic follow‐up, while 166 were sufficient for assessing the pacemakers' working status. During the study, there were 19 deaths in the telemedicine group and 20 in the control group. There was no significant difference between the two groups(P = 0.40). The probability that an individual patient's pacemaker would not to be replaced over time was analysed in a similar way to the Kaplan‐Meier survival function. Fewer pacemakers were replaced in the telemedicine group (14) than in the control group (18), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.26). We conclude that alternating telemedical and in‐clinic follow‐ups brings no additional risks for patients. The follow‐up procedure is feasible and interpretation of the pacemakers' magnet effect provides an easy‐to‐use, manufacturer‐independent method of assessing the pacemakers' working status. This should reduce the patient load on pacemaker centres and decrease the overall costs of pacemaker therapy.

YR: 2014
KY: Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Intestinal Diseases
AB: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is an invalidating disease mainly diagnosed in young people. The disease is characterized by a heterogenic phenotype and the disease course by flares and remissions. As in most chronic diseases the economic burden of IBD is important due to direct health care costs and disability. Health care reorganization for IBD patients in the Netherlands is necessary for several reasons. First chronic (sub)clinical mucosal inflammation results in irreversible bowel damage and complications and none of the presently available drugs is effective for all patients and many drugs have possible severe side effects. To prevent complications of the disease and side effects IBD should be monitored carefully. In the Netherlands however there is a shortage of gastroenterologists where the incidence of IBD is rising. Secondly evidence exists that direct involvement of health care workers, patient empowerment and integrated care can improve the outcome of chronic diseases. Thirdly many clinically relevant aspects (e.g. malnutrition) of this complex disease are not systematically followed in routine care. Finally the government demands registration of efficacy endpoints for expensive drugs in the near future. Therefore the investigators developed a web‐based Telemedicine tool for IBD patients in collaboration with the Dutch IBD patient's organization (CCUVN). "myIBcoach" contains E‐learning modules, monitors disease activity, disability, quality of life, adherence, infections, smoking status, side effects, stress and malnutrition on fixed time points with validated questionnaires, allows the patient to communicate with health care workers and gives feedback to the back office and the patient. A feasibility study in 30 IBD patients in 3 centres showed a high satisfaction and compliance of IBD‐patients and health care workers with this telemedicine tool. The aim of this study is to compare standard care for IBD patients in 3 hospitals with a care via the telemedicine tool myIBDcoach.

AB: Objectives: This study reports the methodology and 1‐year results Of a regional service model of teleconsultation for planning and treatment of complex thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA). Methods: Complex TAAA without a feasible conventional surgical repair were prospectively evaluated by expert vascular surgeons of the same health public provider (National Health System) dislocated in a huge area of 22,994 km2 with 3.7 million of inhabitants and 11 tertiary hospitals. Surgeons evaluated computed tomography scans and clinical details, which were placed on a Web platform (Google Drive, Calif) and shared to all surgeons. Patients give informed consent for the teleconsultation. The surgeon who submitted a case discusses in detail his or her case and prospects for a possible therapeutical strategy. The other surgeons suggest other solutions and options in terms of grafts, techniques, or access to be used. Angiographic and clinical outcomes of cases are then presented at the following telemeetings, and a final agreement of the operative strategy is evaluated. Teleconsultation is performed using a Web conference service (web.conference.com; Avaya Inc, Basking Ridge, NJ) with a monthly appointment. Results: The rate of participation was constant (mean surgeons, 11 [range, 9‐15]). Twenty‐four complex TAAAs were discussed for the difficult planning and/or operation during the study period. The concordance for planning and therapeutic strategy among all participants was complete in 16 cases; in one case, the consultation was decisive for creating an innovative therapeutic strategy, while in the remaining five cases, the strategy proposed by the patient's tutor was changed completely following the discussion. A surgical team composed by surgeons from different centers performed two of the 24 procedures. Conclusions: Such a regional service of teleconsulation may be of value in standardizing the treatment and derived costs of complex TAAAs in a huge region under the same health provider. The shared decision‐making strategy may be of medical legal value as well.

AB: BACKGROUND: IBD affects 1.6 million people in the US and is associated with increased healthcare utilization. Telemedicine is an alternative healthcare delivery system which could improve outcomes and decrease costs. The objective of this study was to compare healthcare utilization 1 year before and after randomization among participants receiving TELE‐IBD and standard care. METHODS: The TELEIBD study was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial conducted over 1 year. Controls received standard care whereas TELE‐IBD participants completed testing with TELE‐IBD weekly (W) or every other week (EOW). Testing consisted of an assessment of symptoms, side effects, and weight, alerts to providers, action plans to participants, and educational messages. Healthcare utilization was assessed by review of the electronic medical record and categorized as office and emergency department visits, diagnostic tests, infusions, procedures and hospitalizations. RESULTS: Total encounters increased in all groups after enrollment; increased utilization was due to significant increases in office visits, infusions, and telephone encounters (Table 1). There was no difference in total encounters between groups. Telephone calls increased significantly from baseline in TELE‐IBD EOW and W; however, the difference was not significant between groups. IBD‐related hospitalizations increased in controls (22 to 26) but decreased from 27 to 16 in TELE‐IBD EOW and 27 to 11 in TELE‐IBD W respectively (TELE‐IBD W vs. controls, p <.05). CONCLUSION: Healthcare utilization increased in all groups and was not decreased with use of TELE‐IBD. However, use of TELE‐IBD W was associated with a significant decrease in IBD‐related hospitalizations. Despite more frequent interactions with the care team in TELE‐IBD groups, telephone and electronic communications were not increased compared to standard care. Further research is needed to determine if telemedicine can be used to decrease healthcare utilization. (Table Presented).

AB: Background: Although ICD parameters (e.g. pacing rate/mode/output, threshold and type of anti‐tachycardia therapy) are primarily changed to optimize patient outcomes, adjustment may also increase the maximum device longevity. This may decrease generator changes and their associated morbidity (primarily infection) and health care costs. Purpose: We evaluated the relative impact of adjustable programming parameters on ICD longevity in a large cohort. Methods: All patients with current era Medtronic ICDs under remote follow‐up were included. Those with programming changes during follow‐up or premature device removal were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to a derivation (1/3) and validation (2/3) dataset. Parameter data from implant to elective replacement indicator (ERI) date, replacement date, death, or data censor date (21‐Jan‐ 2016) were analyzed. Using the derivation dataset, univariate logrank tests were performed for programming parameters to assess impact on device longevity, with separate analyses for each model and type. In this analysis we report the derivation cohort of Virtuoso VR. Results: Of the entire cohort of over 300,000 pts, 5699 were assessed (75% male; mean age 61 yrs) with implant dates ranging from 11/2006 to 01/2011. Only 35 patients (0.6%) had parameter changes following initial programming. On the remaining 5664 pts, 7 of 17 parameters had statistically significant differences in device longevity associated with their programmed values (Table 1); specifically, devices having EGM pre‐storage Off and pacing mode Rate Response Off throughout usage had significantly longer device longevity. (Figure presented) Conclusions: In a large single‐chamber ICD population, EGM pre‐storage, rate response, ventricular pulse width and lower rate programming significantly impact ICD longevity.

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct01263678
YR: 2010
KY: Constriction, Pathologic; Spinal Stenosis
AB: Treatment options for lumbar spinal stenosis include surgical and non‐surgical approaches. For most people, the decision depends on how bothered they are by their symptoms and how they feel about having surgery. Since individuals with the same clinical presentation may feel differently about their symptoms and how they view the benefits and harms of their options, there is no agreed upon "best"treatment. It has been shown that, for "preference‐sensitive" decisions like this one, decision aids (tools that pair balanced, evidence‐based information regarding treatment options with values clarification) improve patients'knowledge and realistic expectations, lower decisional conflict, increase patient involvement in decision making, decrease the number of undecided, and increase agreement between values and choice.1 The Spine Center, in collaboration with the Center for Shared Decision Making (CSDM) at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC), has been providing patients with decision aids (DAs) for several years. Hypothesis: Patients identified as having low literacy and/or high decisional conflict after viewing a video decision aid will show greater resolution of their decisional conflict, higher decision self‐efficacy and less decision regret if a coaching intervention is paired with a video decision aid. Decision support in the form of coaching develops patients'skills in preparing for a consultation and deliberating about their options.2 A study of women with abnormal uterine bleeding showed that pairing coaching with a DA helped patients clarify their values and preferences, reduced costs, and increased long term satisfaction.3 The investigators plan to assess the impact of coaching in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis who are referred to the CSDM for a video decision aid about their treatment options. The investigators are also interested to learn whether screening for low literacy and high decisional conflict can identify a subgroup of patients who are more likely to benefit from coaching.

DOI: 10.1016/j.eurpsy.2017.12.016
AB: Introduction.‐ Eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by disturbed eating patterns and undue influence of body shape and weight on self‐evaluation. Four prominent symptoms in EDs are: restrictive eating, binge eating, purging and excessive exercise. Research has shown that app‐based treatment can reduce ED‐pathology and that symptom reduction is similar to traditional face‐to‐face treatment. An app‐intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) combined with regular video consultations has not previously been developed and used for these four ED‐symptoms. Objectives.‐ The aim of the study was to develop a CBT appintervention supplemented by weekly video‐consultations with a psychologist for persons suffering from restrictive eating, binge eating, purging or excessive exercise. Methods.‐ We conducted a feasibility study aiming to develop and pilot‐test the treatment model consisting of a 10‐week CBT program with app‐interventions and psychotherapeutic video consultations. Results.‐ The psychotherapeutic content of the app (including assessment, psychoeducation, exposure therapy and motivation to change) and the development of the app‐design will be presented, as will the preliminary results of the pilot‐test on 10 patients. Conclusions.‐ The combination of an app and psychotherapeutic video consultations may be effective in the treatment of restrictive eating, binge eating, purging or exercise addiction. Furthermore, Internet‐based ED‐treatment makes treatment accessibility easier and may spare economical costs and travel time. The next part of this study is designed to evaluate the effect of the treatment in a randomized controlled trial addressing symptom reduction, quality of life and the participants' experience with technology‐based treatment.

AB: Purpose Retinopathy of prematuity screening is the key element for good ROP care allowing well timed treatment which can result in highly successful results from laser and early vitrectomy treatment. Customarily ROP screening has been done by doctors doing on average at our institution 6 exam per baby prior to Discharge from the NICU. ROP is a very serious Disease but only about 18% of eyes require treatment by a physician. In adDition bedside exams are often documented by retinal drawing by the doctor which can lead to human error. A photograph can be stuDied and shared with accuracy with the neonatologist, NICU sta , and parents, and sent for remote reaDings by skilled readers in any location avoiDing travel time for the examiner and time in the nursery. Handling of images must follow privacy laws and provide accurate representation of retinal finDings that trigger bedside exam and treatment. It has been proven in several stuDies that telemeDicine can transfer images accurately, but software also can be designed to reduce human error. Methods FocusROP software was designed to reduce human error in two areas of telemeDicine, as well as reducing the need for doctor time doing ROP examinations in the NICU, thereby reducing cost of ROP screening and proviDing photographic documentation. Two areas of potential human error are image uploaDing by the NICU nurse and, for doctors, timing of the next examination as ROP is very time sensitive. Exams that extend the next exam by only a few weeks can result in a Disasterous sequence of events and missing a treatment interval. The FocusROP software overcomes these issues by using an oriented upload pattern that makes erroneous image loaDing less possible, and the examination schedual is fixed based on the observed finDings and randomized study recommendations and not changeable by the doctor, therefore error in exam schedule is not possible. We have used this system in a two hospital system for 3 years, well over 2 500 exams. Results We have reduced the inDicated doctor preformed bedside exams by 84% and no baby has missed a treatment interval. After instruction there were only 10 uploaDing errors by NICU nurses. Conclusions Photographic documentation and telemeDicine management of ROP care with intelligent software can provide better documentation, safer screening, and less doctor time going to and in the NICU therefore reducing cost of ROP screening . TelemeDicine for ROP is the future of screening for ROP.

AB: BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy is treatment of choice for insomnia, but availability is scarce. Self‐help can increase availability at low cost, but evidence for its efficacy is limited, especially for the typical insomnia patient with co‐morbid problems. We hypothesized that a cognitive behaviorally based self‐help book is effective to treat insomnia in individuals, also with co‐morbid problems, and that the effect is enhanced by adding brief therapist telephone support. METHODS: Volunteer sample; 133 media‐recruited adults with insomnia. History of sleep difficulties (mean [SD]) 11.8 [12.0] years. 92.5% had co‐morbid problems (e.g. allergy, pain, and depression). Parallel randomized (block‐randomization, n ≥ 21) controlled "open label" trial; three groups‐bibliotherapy with (n = 44) and without (n = 45) therapist support, and waiting list control (n = 44). Assessments before and after treatment, and at three‐month follow‐up. Intervention was six weeks of bibliotherapeutic self‐help, with established cognitive behavioral methods including sleep restriction, stimulus control, and cognitive restructuring. Therapist support was a 15‐minute structured telephone call scheduled weekly. Main outcome measures were sleep diary data, and the Insomnia Severity Index. RESULTS: Intention‐to‐treat analyses of 133 participants showed significant improvements in both self‐help groups from pre to post treatment compared to waiting list. For example, treatment with and without support gave shorter sleep onset latency (improvement minutes [95% Confidence Interval], 35.4 [24.2 to 46.6], and 20.6 [10.6 to 30.6] respectively), and support gave a higher remission rate (defined as ISI score below 8; 61.4%), than bibliotherapy alone (24.4%, p's < .001). Improvements were not seen in the control group (sleep onset latency 4.6 minutes shorter [‐1.5 to 10.7], and remission rate 2.3%). Self‐help groups maintained gains at three‐month follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: Participants receiving self‐help for insomnia benefited markedly. Self‐help, especially if therapist‐supported, has considerable potential to be as effective as individual treatment at lower cost, also for individuals with co‐morbid problems.

AB: The development of pulmonary treatments has led to preservation of lung function and significantly improved survival in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the significant complexity, time‐burden, and cost of these therapies make it challenging for patients to use them to optimal effect. Patient adherence to CF respiratory medication protocols is similar to that of other chronic diseases, with estimated adherence rates ranging 30‐70%. To address the challenges of disease self‐management in CF, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Success with Therapies Research Consortium (STRC) has commenced research to identify interventions that will improve treatment adherence. We have initiated a multi‐center pilot study through the STRC to investigate the effect of tele‐coaching to improve adherence in CF. Tele‐coaching presents a potential modality to incorporate key aspects of a successful provider‐patient partnership, plus flexibility in integrating a variety of behavioral strategies found effective in addressing patient's non‐adherence to treatment. However, to optimally conduct a tele‐coaching intervention, feasibility should be first determined amongst both people living with CF and CF care team providers. Using stakeholder feedback, we developed a multi‐center study to determine the feasibility of tele‐coaching as a behavioral health intervention to improve treatment adherence in people with CF. The study will collect data from 35‐40 people with CF, ranging in age from 14‐25 years, by using semi‐structured interview and focus group approaches. To follow CF Foundation infection control guidelines, focus groups for people with CF will be conducted via webbased tele‐conferences. Focus groups will also be conducted with parents of people with CF, and with CF care team providers. Questions include themes regarding patient access to “smart‐devices” (devices capable of internet‐based web conferencing), acceptance in tele‐coaching, and preference for frequency and/or care‐team specialties involved in tele‐coaching. In addition, the study will validate the CF Care Behaviors Survey to assess patient non‐adherence to treatments, plus assess the reliability of using a digital image capture of vest usage monitors to track adherence to vest therapy. The study will determine feasibility, and identify logistical challenges, for implementing a tele‐coaching intervention to promote patient adherence behaviors. Following this qualitative first phase, the second phase of this study will include a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine effect sizes on primary outcomes of interest including treatment adherence. Our ultimate goal is to conduct a full RCT to assess the clinical efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of tele‐coaching as an intervention in improving treatment adherence in CF..

AB: BACKGROUND: Less than one‐third of HIV‐infected pregnant women eligible for combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally initiate treatment prior to delivery, with lack of access to timely CD4 results being a principal barrier. We evaluated the effectiveness of an SMS‐based intervention to improve access to timely antenatal ART. METHODS: We conducted a stepped‐wedge cluster randomized trial of a low‐cost programmatic intervention in 20 antenatal clinics in Gaborone, Botswana. From July 2011‐April 2012, 2 clinics were randomly selected every 4 weeks to receive an ongoing clinic‐based educational intervention to improve CD4 collection and to receive CD4 results via an automated SMS platform with active patient tracing. CD4 testing before 26 weeks gestation and ART initiation before 30 weeks gestation were assessed. RESULTS: Three‐hundred‐sixty‐six ART‐naïve women were included, 189 registering for antenatal care under Intervention and 177 under Usual Care periods. Of CD4‐eligible women, 100 (59.2%) women under Intervention and 79 (50.6%) women under Usual Care completed CD4 phlebotomy before 26 weeks gestation, adjusted odds ratio (aOR, adjusted for time that a clinic initiated Intervention) 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI]0.47‐1.63, P = 0.67). The SMS‐based platform reduced time to clinic receipt of CD4 test result from median of 16 to 6 days (P<0.001), was appreciated by clinic staff, and was associated with reduced operational cost. However, rates of ART initiation remained low, with 56 (36.4%) women registering under Intervention versus 37 (24.2%) women under Usual Care initiating ART prior to 30 weeks gestation, aOR 1.06 (95%CI 0.53‐2.13, P = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: The augmented SMS‐based intervention delivered CD4 results more rapidly and efficiently, and this type of SMS‐based results delivery platform may be useful for a variety of tests and settings. However, the intervention did not appear to improve access to timely antenatal CD4 testing or ART initiation, as obstacles other than CD4 impeded ART initiation during pregnancy.

AB: STUDY OBJECTIVE: Increasingly, low‐income inner‐city patients with diabetes utilize emergency departments (EDs) for acute and chronic care. We seek to determine whether a scalable, low‐cost, unidirectional, text message‐based mobile health intervention (TExT‐MED) improves clinical outcomes, increases healthy behaviors, and decreases ED utilization in a safety net population. METHODS: We conducted an randomized controlled trial of 128 adult patients with poorly controlled diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin [Hb A1C] level ≥8%) in an urban, public ED. The TExT‐MED group received 2 daily text messages for 6 months in English or Spanish. The primary outcome was change in Hb A1C level. Secondary outcomes included changes in medication adherence, self‐efficacy, performance of self‐care tasks, quality of life, diabetes‐specific knowledge, ED utilization, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Hb A1C level decreased by 1.05% in the TExT‐MED group compared with 0.60% in the controls (Δ0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] ‐0.27 to 1.17) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes favored the TExT‐MED group, with the most sizable change observed in self‐reported medication adherence (as measured by the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, an 8‐point validated scale with higher scores representing better adherence), which improved from 4.5 to 5.4 in the TExT‐MED group compared with a net decrease of ‐0.1 in the controls (Δ1.1 [95% CI 0.1 to 2.1]). Effects were larger among Spanish speakers for both medication adherence (1.1 versus ‐0.3; Δ1.4; 95% CI 0.2 to 2.7) and Hb A1C (‐1.2% versus ‐0.4%) in the TExT‐MED group. The proportion of patients who used emergency services trended lower in the TExT‐MED group (35.9% versus 51.6%; Δ15.7%; 95% CI 9.4% to 22%). Overall, 93.6% of respondents enjoyed TExT‐MED and 100% would recommend it to family/friends. CONCLUSION: The TExT‐MED program did not result in a statistically significant improvement in Hb A1C. However, trends toward improvement in the primary outcome of Hb A1C and other secondary outcomes, including quality of life, were observed, the most pronounced being improved medication adherence. TExT‐MED also decreased ED utilization. These findings were magnified in the Spanish‐speaking subgroup. Technologies such as TExT‐MED represent highly scalable, low‐cost, and widely accessible solutions for safety‐net ED populations.

TI: Medical and Resource Facilitation Intervention After Traumatic Brain Injury
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03429322
YR: 2018
KY: Brain Injuries; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Wounds and Injuries
AB: This Integrated Medical and Resource Facilitation Intervention (MRFI) trial will address: 1) The ineffective connection of individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their families to specialized medical and community resources after hospital‐based care; 2) Limited access to TBI experts, and; 3) A lack of knowledge by primary care providers (PCP) about the complex needs of individuals with TBI. This clinical trial will test a theory‐driven complex behavioral intervention that integrates the medical and TBI expertise of Mayo's Brain Rehabilitation Clinic (BRC) with Minnesota Brain Injury Alliance's (MN BIA) highly developed Resource Facilitation (RF) program. The target populations for the proposed study are: 1) Individuals with TBI eligible for MN BIA RF services; 2) Their families or caregivers; and 3) Their PCPs. This research uses a community‐based pragmatic clinical trial (PCT) to test a complex behavioral intervention. A PCT: 1) Compares multiple clinically relevant interventions rather than comparing an intervention of interest against a placebo or control condition; 2) Includes a heterogeneous population of participants in multiple experimental settings as opposed to a narrowly controlled homogeneous sample in practice settings of a single kind; and 3) Measures a broad range of health care outcomes. The active elements in the proposed trial define a 'complex behavioral intervention'. The intervention's integrated MRFI model of care consists of: multiple components within the experimental and control interventions that interact; multiple and complex behaviors associated with those delivering and receiving the intervention; multiple target populations; multiple outcome measurements; and, adapting the intervention based on need and context. At trial's end, the investigators will estimate the difference in the use of health care resources between individuals with TBI who receive the intervention versus those who receive usual care, by completing a cost‐effectiveness analysis. True success of a clinical intervention is achieved when its benefits are realized at a similar or diminished cost compared to an alternative treatment. Specific Aims Specific Aim 1: To assess the effectiveness of a medical/RF intervention provided remotely in improving participation outcomes of individuals with TBI when compared to a similar group receiving usual care. Hypothesis 1: Participants receiving the trial intervention will show greater improvement in participation outcomes when compared to those receiving usual care. Specific Aim 2: To test for the differences in caregiver burden and quality of life in the families of individuals with TBI involved in each arm of this trial. Hypothesis 2: The family members of individuals with TBI receiving the trial intervention will report lower caregiver burden and higher quality of life when compared to family members of individuals with TBI receiving usual care. Specific Aim 3: To measure differences in efficacy and mastery among PCPs in caring for individuals with TBI. Hypothesis 3: PCPs for individuals with TBI receiving the trial intervention will report higher self‐efficacy and mastery, when compared to providers for individuals with TBI receiving usual care. Specific Aim 4: To compare the cost‐effectiveness of the integrated service intervention arm of the trial with the usual care arm. Hypothesis 4: Cost‐effectiveness will be the same or less overall for individuals with TBI receiving the trial intervention when adjusted for covariates compared to those individuals receiving usual care. Methods Sample Minnesota has statutory authority to identify individuals discharged from hospitals with TBI for epidemiological surveillance and to connect them with the MN BIA to offer RF. During subsequent RF intake, the recruitment and consent process will commence with RF staff introducing the study. A list of interested individuals will be securely submitted to the Mayo Research Coordinator; these individuals will then be contacted for consent and randomized. If the individual with TBI is unable to consent based on a cognitive screen, their legal representative will be approached. Participants will not be required to have a family member or PCP enrolled to be eligible for the study, but will be strongly encouraged to involve both. A consented participant's family and PCP will be contacted for consent as research participants. They will be assigned to the same group as the individual with TBI. Randomization to ensure representation of known prognostic factors where age (≤65 and >65), gender, and residence (rural or urban) will be used as stratification factors, with treatment assignment balanced in blocks of 4. Because a simple random scheme may limit enrollment of rural participants the investigators will over‐sample in a ratio of 2:1 rural/urban. Sample Size and Power Calculations For Specific Aim 1, a sample size of 500 individuals is considered desirable based on power calculations as described. By achieving this sample size a minimum difference of at least 0.25 standard deviations can be detected between groups for each continuous outcome of interest, with 80% power based on a two‐sample t‐test. In 2014, 3,868 people 15 years old or older were hospitalized with TBI in MN and 1,108 people with TBI received RF in MN in 2016. The investigators plan a 24‐month enrollment period, so 2,216 individuals with TBI will be potentially eligible. The minimum detectable difference between the groups based on a two sample t‐test will be 0.25 standard deviations. The sample size of 250 per group will have 80% power to detect a correlation of 0.18 or larger between any two continuous outcomes within the group. For an assessment of associations between group and other categorical variables, there would exist 80% power to detect a difference of 11% or larger for the presence of a categorical outcome (15% among participant with usual care versus 25% among participants receiving the study intervention) based on a Chi‐square test of two proportions. Intervention All intervention components will be delivered remotely: there will be no face‐to‐face interaction with the research participants. The complex intervention being tested is comprised of the clinical, educational, and supportive services of the Mayo BRC integrated with the MN BIA RF program. The specific ICT modes used to interact with intervention participants, and the specific clinical services that are provided by these modes, will be determined by clinical need, individual preference, and technological capacity. Individuals with TBI, their family members and PCPs assigned to the usual care group will receive care and provide services as usual in their communities. Individuals with TBI assigned to the usual care group will receive RF as routinely provided by MN BIA. For individuals with TBI, their families and PCPs assigned to the intervention group, their health, social, community, education, support, resource, and care coordination needs will be assessed. Individuals with TBI assigned to the intervention group will receive RF as integrated into the intervention. Every intervention group participant in all target populations will receive a unique combination of services. It is expected that the composition of each participant's integrated team will vary based on individual needs, preferences, and technological capacity. Ideally, all teams will include a PCP. If a PCP is not already established, the Advanced Practice Registered Nurse will help facilitate this. The MRFI intervention expands on a previously established web‐based platform and other ICT, incorporating synchronous direct clinical care (telemedicine). Other synchronous and asynchronous intervention will be delivered as needs indicate. Participants will use their own devices and internet access for any and all interactions with Mayo Clinic providers. Data Analysis Data for continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Frequencies and percentages will be calculated for categorical variables. Baseline characteristics and demographic variables will be compared using two sample t‐test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables and using Chi‐square test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables of interest. Associations between continuous variables within each group will be estimated using Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient. Comparison of correlations across the groups of interests will be performed using the Fisher's r‐to‐z transformation, which calculates a value of z that can be applied to assess the significance of the difference between two correlation coefficients. All the statistical tests will be 2‐sided with an alpha level of 0.05. Statistical analysis for Specific Aim 1 For each individual outcome measure the investigators will first compute percent change from baseline to last follow‐up measurement to account for baseline measurements. Further analysis will be performed using these percent changes. However, analyzing effectiveness using each individual measure will not provide a single p‐value to measure the intervention's overall effect on participation outcomes. Therefore, the investigators will perform the analysis using a composite endpoint that will allow us to assess the global impact of the intervention using single comparisons performed as two sample t‐tests or a Wilcoxon rank sum test. All analyses will be performed on an intent‐to‐treat basis. If there are any baseline covariate imbalances between the groups, the investigators will perform linear regression analyses, where summed ranks for each individual will be an outcome of interest and the primary predictor variable will be group, adjusting for those covariates that had imbalances among the groups at baseline. Statistical analysis for Specific Aims 2 and 3 The primary goal of these Aims is to measure caregiver burden and family needs, and efficacy and clinical mastery in PCPs. Percent change from baseline will be reported as mean and standard deviation or median as appropriate. Comparisons of percents between the groups assigned to intervention versus usual care will be performed using two sample t‐tests or Wilcoxon rank sum test as appropriate. If there is imbalance in any baseline covariates of interest, analysis will be performed using linear regression adjusting for those covariates of interest. Statistical analysis for Specific Aim 4 In order to assess the cost‐effectiveness of the proposed intervention, the trial patients will be linked to the Minnesota All Payers Claims Database (MN‐APCD) developed and maintained by MDH. Both healthcare utilization and cost outcomes will be compared between the participants in the intervention and usual care arms. Adjustments will be made to account for different payment levels between governmental and commercial payers. Descriptive statistics of these outcomes including mean, median, and standard deviation will be provided. If any difference between the intervention and usual care groups in terms of their baseline characteristics is observed, multivariate adjustments will be conducted; due to expected skewness of underlying distribution, utilization outcomes will be analyzed using count regression (e.g., negative binomial regression) while cost will be analyzed using generalized linear modeling with gamma distribution for cost, and logarithmic link. In order to meet the confidentiality terms of the data submitters to MN‐APCD, trial participants' records will be matched by applying the same MN algorithms to generate the hashed identifiers used to link claims for the same person through the following set of identifiers: name (first, middle, and last name), 5‐digit zip code, age, gender, and date of birth. To carry out this linkage and avoid the possibility of participant re‐identification, the creation of the analytic dataset from MN‐APCD and subsequent analyses will be conducted by the MDH staff. The match rate of the trial participants to the MN‐APCD will be reported.

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct01416012
YR: 2011
AB: Interactive games (virtual reality) have recently been the center of interest and scientific discussion in the field of cognitive and functional rehabilitation. From their entertaining and contextual aspects, off‐the‐shelf video games are potentially interesting tools as adjunct to the patient care, especially for maintaining instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) autonomy. Disease and physical inactivity worsen the patient's ability in the IADLs, thus reducing health related quality of life (HRQL). This decrease in cognitive and functional abilities can be slowed down using adapted rehabilitation program. However, there is no randomized controlled study comparing usual physical therapy to virtual reality gaming consoles such as the Nintendo Wii or the Xbox 360 Kinect. Off‐the‐shelf gaming consoles offer a large range of games where cognitive and functional abilities from geriatric patients could be stimulated and consequently HRQL improved. However, a better knowledge of the potential cognitive and functional improvement processes from virtual reality rehabilitation in institutional routine is needed to enhance the quality and the range of the available care in old adults. This study will not only be a validation platform of virtual reality as stand alone rehabilitation process but also will assess the cost effectiveness of off‐the‐shelf gaming consoles in HRQL improvement of old adults. The investigators will compare the efficacy of two off‐the‐shelf gaming consoles in HRQL changes of patients with Alzheimer disease and related disorders. •Method This study is a randomized controlled trial that comprises two study phases : Phase one; comparing three parallel groups where therapists and assessors will be kept blind of study objectives, and Phase two, the investigators will take the most cost‐effective gaming console from phase one (Nintendo Wii or Xbox 360 Kinect) and the investigators will use it as an adjunct to physical therapy compared to physical therapy alone, with respect to the same amount of rehabilitation time. The interventions are of 120min/week for 6 weeks and a follow‐up at 4 weeks after intervention. Patients will be randomized in either Xbox 360 Kinect group ‐ a Nintendo Wii group ‐ or physical therapy as the 'gold' standard condition. All groups will receive the same amount of rehabilitation time. Power and sample calculation for phase two will be based on phase one results.

AB: Despite recent improvements in the US economy, unemployment remains a significant concern, and estimates indicate that one‐third of unemployed persons drink at hazardous levels, adversely impacting their health and abilities to find jobs. Reinforcement interventions are highly efficacious in reducing substance use, and they can be applied to increase job‐seeking activities as well. In partnership with CT United Labor Agency, this project is designed to reduce hazardous drinking and enhance active participation in job‐seeking activities among those with job loss. It will evaluate the independent and combined effects of reinforcing negative breathalyzer samples and job‐seeking activities to ascertain the simplest and most cost‐effective approach to improving outcomes in this population. Unemployed individuals with hazardous drinking (N = 280) will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions using a 2 x 2 design: standard care, standard care with reinforcement for submitting negative breathalyzer samples, standard care with reinforcement for job‐seeking activities, or standard care plus reinforcement for both negative breathalyzer samples and job‐seeking activities. Participants in all conditions will receive usual services part of CT United Labor Agency, along with a novel remote breath alcohol monitoring procedure. The study interventions will be in effect for three months, and participants will be followed for one year. Alcohol and other drug use, employment, psychiatric symptoms, and global measures of health will be assessed throughout treatment and follow‐up. Reinforcing negative breathalyzer samples is expected to significantly reduce drinking, and reinforcing job‐seeking activities is expected to increase re‐employment rates and reduce time until job attainment. Reinforcing both negative breathalyzer samples and job‐seeking activities is hypothesized to improve outcomes along both domains. The reinforcement interventions may also decrease psychiatric distress and slow progression of physical decline, common among the unemployed. If efficacious and cost‐effective, results from this study may stimulate adoption of reinforcement interventions in the context of unemployment services. Reducing the adverse consequences of hazardous drinking and improving job re‐entry may have pronounced benefits in a highly vulnerable segment of the US population.

AB: Objectives The objective of this study was to evaluate operational policies that may improve the proportion of eligible stroke patients within a population who would receive intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt‐PA) and minimize time to treatment in eligible patients. Methods In the context of a regional stroke team, the authors examined the effects of staff location and telemedicine deployment policies on the timeliness of thrombolytic treatment, and estimated the efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of six different policies. A process map comprising the steps from recognition of stroke symptoms to intravenous administration of rt‐PA was constructed using data from published literature combined with expert opinion. Six scenarios were investigated: telemedicine deployment (none, all, or outer‐ring hospitals only) and staff location (center of region or anywhere in region). Physician locations were randomly generated based on their zip codes of residence and work. The outcomes of interest were onset‐to‐treatment (OTT) time, door‐to‐needle (DTN) time, and the proportion of patients treated within 3 hours. A Monte Carlo simulation of the stroke team care‐delivery system was constructed based on a primary data set of 121 ischemic stroke patients who were potentially eligible for treatment with rt‐PA. Results With the physician located randomly in the region, deploying telemedicine at all hospitals in the region (compared with partial or no telemedicine) would result in the highest rates of treatment within 3 hours (80% vs. 75% vs. 70%) and the shortest OTT (148 vs. 164 vs. 176 minutes) and DTN (45 vs. 61 vs. 73 minutes) times. However, locating the on‐call physician centrally coupled with partial telemedicine deployment (five of the 17 hospitals) would be most cost‐effective with comparable eligibility and treatment times. Conclusions Given the potential societal benefits, continued efforts to deploy telemedicine appear warranted. Aligning the incentives between those who would have to fund the up‐front technology investments and those who will benefit over time from reduced ongoing health care expenses will be necessary to fully realize the benefits of telemedicine for stroke care.

AB: BACKGROUND: A large proportion of adults fail to meet public health guidelines for physical activity as well as fruit, vegetable and fat intake. Interventions are needed to improve these health behaviors. Both computer tailoring and motivational interviewing have shown themselves to be promising techniques for health behavior change. The Vitalum project aims to compare the efficacy of these techniques in improving the health behaviors of adults aged 45‐70. This paper describes the design of the Vitalum study. METHODS/DESIGN: Dutch general medical practices (N = 23) were recruited via a registration network or by personal invitation. The participants were then enrolled through these general practices using an invitational letter. They (n = 2,881) received a written baseline questionnaire to assess health behaviors, and potential psychosocial and socio‐demographic behavioral determinants. A power analysis indicated that 1,600 participants who were failing to meet the guidelines for physical activity and either fruit or vegetable consumption were needed. Eligible participants were stratified based on hypertension status and randomized into one of four intervention groups: tailored print communication, telephone motivational interviewing, combined, and control. The first two groups either received four letters or took part in four interviews, whereas the combined group received two letters and took part in two interviews in turns at 5, 13, 30 and 43 weeks after returning the baseline questionnaire. Each letter and interview focused on physical activity or nutrition behavior. The participants also took part in a telephone survey 25 weeks after baseline to gather new information for tailoring. There were two follow‐up questionnaires, at 47 and 73 weeks after baseline, to measure short‐ and long‐term effects. The control group received a tailored letter after the last posttest. The process, efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of the interventions will be examined by means of multilevel mixed regression, cost‐effectiveness analyses and process evaluation. DISCUSSION: The Vitalum study simultaneously evaluates the efficacy of tailored print communication and telephone motivational interviewing, and their combined use for multiple behaviors and people with different motivational stages and education levels. The results can be used by policymakers to contribute to evidence‐based prevention of chronic diseases. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Dutch Trial Register NTR1068.

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02828605
YR: 2016
AB: An organ transplant requires a large time and financial investment for both the patient and provider over the course of a lifetime of follow‐up visits and lifestyle monitoring. Patients return to the clinic 2‐3 times a week for the first three months after surgery, and then visit the clinic twice a month with labs once a week 91‐210 days post surgery. Check‐ins for patients without complications occur 1‐2 times a year, and these re‐evaluations require patients to take time off work and travel to the transplant center often 2 hours away. Dr. David Mulligan, Chief of Transplant at Yale wanted to help patients reduce the time and cost associated with their regular checkups after surgery. Thus, we created VIP Transplant. The Virtual Interactive Platform allows patients to have a secure videoconference with their provider in order to eliminate the need for recurring travel and waiting in congested clinics for a short appointment. It will save patient time and cost to travel to the clinic. The application is integrated into the provider network in order to have a system that supports seamless communication between the patient and provider capabilities. Research plan: Dr. Mulligan will contact 8 of his patients who are willing to participate in the study. 4 of the patients will be assigned to the control group and the other 4 will be assigned to the experimental group. Control group: On day 1 after their surgery, patient will be asked to fill out a survey on their transplant care. On day 21, patient will be asked to fill out the same survey. The surgeon will be asked to take a survey to evaluate their each patient's progress. Experimental group: When the 4 patients attend orientation, patient will each be given the iPad with the VIP Transplant app and shown how to use the app. Patient will then be asked to fill out the survey on day 1 after their surgery and then asked to use VIP Transplant for their transplant care in the following days. Patient will then be asked to fill out the survey again on day 21, at the end of the study. The surgeon will be asked to take a survey to evaluate each of their patient's progress.

KY: Diabetes Mellitus; Emergencies
AB: This Phase‐III RCT will compare the efficacy of COPDE (COmmunity Care to Prevent Diabetes Emergencies) vs. intensive home‐based DM education to reduce the number of DM‐related ED visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary outcome), in 230 AAs with DM, 50 years and older, who are recruited from the ED after an ED visit. COPDE is a culturally relevant intervention that extends from the ED to the community, and aims to improve access to care and DM self‐care (secondary outcomes). A mediation analysis will determine whether changes in access to care and/or DM self‐care explain COPDE's efficacy. A moderation analysis will determine whether participants who reside in low‐ vs. high‐need communities [defined by Community Need Index scores (i.e., an indicator of the built environment)] respond differently to treatment. COPDE will begin soon after the participant's index ED visit, when many patients remain uncertain how to manage DM or how to access follow‐up care. Community Health Workers (CHWs), who are race‐concordant with participants, will: 1) deliver in‐home DM education to increase participants' knowledge and skills; 2) use DM‐specific Behavioral Activation to improve DM self‐care; and 3) facilitate telehealth visits with the participant's primary care physician (PCP) and a DM nurse educator to increase access to care. The control treatment, EUC, is intensive home‐based DM education. EUC matches COPDE in treatment intensity (i.e., 6 in‐home sessions over 4 months, and 3 booster sessions over the next 8 months) and delivery of culturally relevant DM education, but does not include DM‐specific Behavioral Activation or telehealth visits. The treatment comparison will identify COPDE's specific efficacy over and above EUC. This RCT is significant as the population ages and becomes more racially diverse, and as ED use and costs increase. This RCT is innovative because it: 1) tests the first ED‐to‐community intervention designed to reduce the need for ED care in AAs with DM; 2) assesses both subjective and objective indicators of access to care; and 3) defines the specific characteristics of COPDE that confer its cultural relevance. If successful, COPDE will meet Healthy People 2020's twin goals of reducing the personal and societal costs of DM and achieving health equity for all Americans. The Specific Aims of this RCT are: Primary Specific Aim: Test the efficacy of COPDE to reduce the number of incident DM‐related ED visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary outcome) in AAs with DM. Hypothesis: COPDE will halve the number of incident DM‐related ED visits and/or hospitalizations relative to EUC over 12 months. The Secondary Aims are to: 1. Test the efficacy of COPDE to increase perceived access to care over 12 months (secondary outcome). Hypothesis: COPDE will increase Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire‐18 scores to a greater extent than EUC over 12 months. 2. Test the efficacy of COPDE to increase realized access to care over 12 months (secondary outcome). Hypothesis: COPDE will increase the number of received Diabetes Quality Metrics (e.g., hemoglobin A1c testing, urine screening) to a greater extent than EUC over 12 months. 3. Test the efficacy of COPDE to improve DM self‐care over 12 months (secondary outcome). Hypothesis: COPDE will increase Diabetes Self‐Care Inventory scores to a greater extent than EUC over 12 months. 4. Determine if increasing subjective and/or objective indicators of access to care and/or DM self‐care mediates COPDE's reduction of DM‐related ED visits and/or hospitalizations. Hypothesis: COPDE will reduce DM‐related ED visits and/or hospitalizations to the extent that it increases subjective and/or objective indicators of access to care and/or improves DM self‐care. The Exploratory Aims are to: 1) determine whether COPDE reduces "all cause" ED visits/hospitalizations relative to EUC.; 2) determine whether Community Need Index scores, literacy, age, and/or sex moderate treatment effects; 3) determine if COPDE improves glycemic control (i.e., lowers hemoglobin A1c levels), impacts DM‐related health beliefs, reduces depression, and/or improves quality‐of‐life; 4) identify COPDE's treatment features that confer its cultural relevance; and 5) estimate COPDE's costs and net financial benefit to the healthcare system.

AB: Although in‐home caregivers (ICGs) help improve diabetes mellitus (DM) outcomes, they may lack the resources needed to do this optimally, and are at risk for psychosocial decline and caregiver burnout. Complicating matters, millions of chronically‐ill older Americans live alone and receive long‐distance caregiving without any supporting structure or resources to ensure its effectiveness. In this study, diabetes patients with poor glycemic will be recruited from two clinical sites, and half will have an ICG. Patients will nominate a "CarePartner" (CP; adult relatives or friends from outside their home) to receive weekly email reports about their DM health and behavioral needs, and will be given resources to help them to provide self‐management support. Patients will then be randomized to receive either one year of CP intervention or usual medical care. In the CP intervention arm, patients will provide weekly updates on their DM health and self‐management through weekly automated telemonitoring. Summaries of this will be emailed to their CP along with guidance on helping the patient address reported problem(s), and their clinicians will be alerted about medically‐urgent problems. We will assess the following outcomes in both arms before intervention and also after 6 and 12 months of intervention: glycemic control, DM‐related distress, DM self‐management, health‐related quality of life, systolic blood pressure, caregiver burden, relationship quality, and cost of DM care.

AB: BACKGROUND: Telemonitoring technology offers one of the most promising alternatives for the provision of health care services at the patient's home. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a primary care‐based telemonitoring intervention on the frequency of hospital admissions. METHODS/DESIGN: A primary care‐based randomised controlled trial will be carried out to assess the impact of a telemonitoring intervention aimed at home care patients with heart failure (HF) and/or chronic lung disease (CLD). The results will be compared with those obtained with standard health care practice. The duration of the study will be of one year. Sixty patients will be recruited for the study. In‐home patients, diagnosed with HF and/or CLD, aged 14 or above and with two or more hospital admissions in the previous year will be eligible. For the intervention group, telemonitoring will consist of daily patient self‐measurements of respiratory‐rate, heart‐rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, weight and body temperature. Additionally, the patients will complete a qualitative symptom questionnaire daily using the telemonitoring system. Routine telephone contacts will be conducted every fortnight and additional telephone contacts will be carried out if the data received at the primary care centre are out of the established limits. The control group will receive usual care. The primary outcome measure is the number of hospital admissions due to any cause that occurred in a period of 12 months post‐randomisation. The secondary outcome measures are: duration of hospital stay, hospital admissions due to HF or CLD, mortality rate, use of health care resources, quality of life, cost‐effectiveness, compliance and patient and health care professional satisfaction with the new technology. DISCUSSION: The results of this study will shed some light on the effects of telemonitoring for the follow‐up and management of chronic patients from a primary care setting. The study may contribute to enhance the understanding of alternative modes of health care provision for medically unstable elderly patients, who bear a high degree of physical and functional deterioration.

AB: Objectives/Introduction: Long‐term conditions are associated with poor adherence. Is especially prevalent in conditions where symptoms may fluctuate or may be hidden like Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Untreated OSA lead to high morbidity, such as reduced cognitive function, depression, infertility, increased risk of accidents, and it is associated with diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Chronic multimorbidity is a new challenge and must involve a change in the global organization of care and follow‐up. We prospectively assessed adherence using daily telemonitoring of naïve Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) OSA patients' data and associated clinical parameters of cardio‐metabolic risk during one year. The ultimate goal of this trial will be to develop an effective, extensible and cost‐effective system to promote improved adherence to CPAP patients. Methods: In a single center, 60 naïve PAP adult patients with moderate to severe OSA were randomized in two groups: standard care consisting in first, third and sixth month consultations and those with daily telemonitoring information (i.e., adherence, air leak, residual AHI) plus first and second week consultation and standard care (first, third and sixth month consultations). Subjects who used PAP for at least 5 hours per night for at least 90% of the days monitored were regarded as adherent. We also analyzed the correlation between adherence and cardio‐metabolic clinical parameters. Results: 52 patients were enrolled, 34 were randomized to telemedicine and 18 to standard care. The mean age was 54,2 year, mean AHI was 38,3 events/hr, and 56% of patients were male. Only after 1 month, mean PAP adherence was significantly greater in the telemedicine arm versus the standard arm. After 3 mo. PAP adherence in the telemedicine arm was almost total sleep time (7h34) versus 3h47 in the standard arm. Conclusions: PAP adherence should be improved with the use of a web‐based telemedicine system at the beginning of the treatment. This trial demonstrates that good PAP adherence occurs during the first few days and can be predicted in first two consultations. Cardio‐ metabolic clinical parameters significantly improved with total sleep time PAP adherence associated with body mass control and exercise.

AB: Objectives/Introduction: Untreated Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) can lead to high morbidity, such as reduced cognitive function and increased risk of accidents, and it is associated with diseases such as systemic arterial hypertension, metabolic syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. Multimorbidity implies to change organization of care and follow‐up. We prospectively assessed adherence using daily telemonitoring of naïve Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) OSA patients' data and other associated clinical parameters of cardio‐metabolic risk during one year. The ultimate goal of this pilot trial will be to develop an effective, extensible and costeffective system to promote improved adherence to CPAP patients, as well as monitor clinical parameters (HR, hypertension, glycaemia, and oximetry) of frequently associated OSA co‐morbidities. Methods: In a single center, 80 naïve PAP adult patients with moderate to severe OSA were randomized in two groups: standard care consisting in first week, first, third and sixth month consultations and those with daily telemonitoring information (i.e., adherence, air leak, residual AHI) plus standard care. Subjects who used PAP for at least 5 h per night for at least 90% of the days monitored were regarded as adherent. We also analyzed the correlation between adherence and cardio‐metabolic clinical parameters. Results: 73 patients were enrolled, 35 were randomized to telemedicine and 38 to standard care. The mean age was 57.2 year, mean AHI was 38,4 events/hr, and 59% of patients were male. After 1 month, mean PAP adherence was significantly greater in the telemedicine arm versus the standard arm. But after 6 months mean PAP adherence was almost total sleep time in both arms (6h34 vs 5h58). Conclusions: PAP adherence can be motivated and faster with the use of a web‐based telemedicine system at the beginning of the treatment. This trial demonstrates that sustained long‐term PAP adherence occurs during the first few days. Telemedicine monitoring of naïve PAP OSA patients can be cost‐effective by reducing the need of consultations. Also cardio‐metabolic clinical parameters significantly improved with total sleep time PAP adherence associated with body mass control and exercise.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Older adults with chronic kidney disease have a high rate of uncontrolled hypertension. Home monitoring of blood pressure (BP) is an integral part of management, but requires that patients bring records to clinic visits. Telemonitoring interventions, however, have not targeted older, less technologically‐skilled populations. METHODS: Veterans with stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease and uncontrolled hypertension were randomized to a novel telemonitoring device pairing a Bluetooth‐enabled BP cuff with an Internet‐enabled hub, which wirelessly transmitted readings (n=28), or usual care (n=15). Home recordings were reviewed weekly and telemonitoring participants were contacted if BP was above goal. The prespecified primary endpoints were improved data exchange and device acceptability. Secondary endpoint was BP change. RESULTS: Forty‐three participants (average age 68 years, 75% white) completed the 6‐month study. Average start‐of‐study BP was 147/78 mmHg. Those in the intervention arm had a median of 29 (IQR 22, 53) transmitted BP readings per month, with 78% continuing to use the device regularly, whereas only 20% of those in the usual care group brought readings to in‐person visits. The median number of telephone contacts triggered by the wireless monitoring was 2 (IQR 1, 4) per patient. Both groups had a significant improvement in systolic BP (P<0.05, for both changes); systolic BP fell a median of 13 mmHg in monitored participants compared with 8.5 mmHg in usual care participants (P for comparison 0.31). CONCLUSION: This low‐cost wireless monitoring strategy led to greater sharing of data between patients and clinic and produced a trend toward improvements in BP control over usual care at 6 months.

AB: INTERVENTION: From hospital databases, we will identify 240 patients who have had more than two admissions to any of Prince Philip, West Wales General, Withybush and Bronglais Hospitals within the last 2 years. Medications will be optimised if not already done. 120 will be randomised to receive telemonitors (Tm's) for 1 year whilst the other 120 receive standard care. After 1 year, the Tm's will be swapped into the homes of the second group (120) in a crossover trial for a further year of monitoring. Once daily the patients would complete a set of questions relating to COPD symptoms and record their oxygen levels, pulse rate and temperature. The Tm automatically sends the information via a (free) telephone line to a secure internet site. The results are reviewed daily by the home COPD specialist team and if there is any signs of worsening of their condition they would intervene with a phone call followed by a visit and treatment escalation, if appropriate. We hope that earlier intervention may prevent further deterioration, requiring hospital admission or multiple GP visits. The monitors are also set up to generate an email alert to the nurses if any questions or recordings indicate a significant deterioration. All participants are aware that the Tm is not a replacement for their usual actions but to be used as an early warning system and they should seek direct help live in a severe emergency. CONDITION: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ; Respiratory ; Other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease PRIMARY OUTCOME: The number of hospital admissions SECONDARY OUTCOME: 1. Quality of life measures (EQ‐5D and CA‐COPD questionnaires) at baseline and every 6 months for 2 years; 2. Healthcare contacts ‐ GP visits, outpatient visits and home contacts by the community COPD nurses over the 2 years of the study; 3. A cost evaluation will also be undertaken after the 2 years INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. 240 still living subjects with a primary diagnosis of COPD will identified from hospital admissions database 2. Two or more admissions to any of the following hospitals in the last 2 years ‐ Prince Philip; West Wales General; Withybush; Bronglais 3.

AB: Background: An array of implantable and external devices for telemonitoring has emerged with variable effectiveness and cost beneft, but there have been no meta‐analyses to assess the effectiveness of these devices. Methods: Medline and Cochrane database searches were conducted. After review of abstracts and selected full text articles, we identifed 5 randomized trials for inclusion. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. We assessed the number of HF related events and hospitalizations during the follow‐up period. A random effects model was used. Subgroup analysis was based on categorizing devices into direct hemodynamic measuring devices (DHMDs) and impedance‐based devices (IBDs). Results: Of the 5 trials, 3 assessed DHMDs and 2 IBDs. Of the 2 trials which assessed IBDs, one was stopped prematurely because of increased HF related events in the intervention arm but it was included in the analysis. One. The relative risk for HF related events for all studies combined was 0.83 (95% CI 0.70‐0.99). Applying this RR to the control event rate, we calculated a number needed to treat of 6. Meta‐analysis of the two IBD studies did not fnd a reduction in HF related events i.e. 0.94 (95% CI 0.41‐2.12). Whereas, the 3 DHMD studies did have a signifcant impact on HF related events 0.82 (95% CI 0.69‐0.98). The 2 trials that examined the secondary outcome of HF readmissions were the COMPASS and CHAMPION trials, with a 30% reduction in HF readmission with a relative risk of 0.71 (95% CI 0.60‐0.83). Conclusions: Overall, telemonitoring implantable devices in NYHA III/IV HF patients reduces HF related events by about 17% 6. IBDs tend to be less effective when compared to DHMDs. There is 30% reduction in HF readmission rates for NYHA III/IV patients DHMDs are implanted.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Depression affects nearly one in five Americans at some time in their life, causing individual suffering and financial cost. The Internet has made it possible to deliver telemedicine care economically to areas and populations with limited access to specialist or culturally and linguistically congruent care. METHODS: This study compared the effectiveness for Hispanic patients of depression treatment provided by a psychiatrist through Internet videoconferencing (Webcam intervention) and treatment as usual by a primary care provider. Adults (N=167) with a diagnosis of depression were recruited from a community clinic and were randomly assigned to treatment condition. Webcam participants met remotely each month with the psychiatrist, and treatment‐as‐usual patients received customary care from their primary care providers, all for six months. At baseline and three and six months, analyses of variance tested differences between conditions in scores on depression rating scales and quality‐of‐life and functional ability measures. RESULTS: All participants experienced an improvement in depression symptoms. Ratings on the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale by clinicians blind to treatment group and self‐ratings on the nine‐item Patient Health Questionnaire, Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, and Sheehan Disability Scale showed a significant main effect of time. On all four measures, a significant interaction of time by intervention favoring the Webcam group was noted. DISCUSSION: Results suggest that telepsychiatry delivered through the Internet utilizing commercially available domestic Webcams and standard Internet and computer equipment is effective and acceptable. Use of this technology may help close the gap in access to culturally and linguistically congruent specialists.

AB: Managing chronic pain effectively is often challenging for health care providers and patients. Telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and improve patients' quality of care in communities where access to pain specialists has previously been unavailable. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a telehealth intervention (TelePain) designed to address the need for pain specialist consultation regarding pain and symptom management issues in non‐academic medical centers. We describe the theoretical foundation and development of a multifaceted intervention using a cluster randomized clinical trial design. Health care providers and their patients with chronic pain are enrolled in the study. Patient participants receive the intervention (report of symptoms and receipt of a pain graph) weekly for 8 weeks and are contacted at 12 weeks for completion of post‐intervention follow‐up measures. Their providers attend TelePain sessions which involve a didactic presentation on an evidence‐based topic related to pain management followed by patient case presentations and discussion by community clinicians. Symptom management recommendations for each patient case are made by a panel of pain specialists representing internal medicine, addiction medicine, rehabilitation medicine, anesthesiology, psychiatry, and nursing. The outcomes assessed in this randomized trial focus on pain intensity, pain's interference on function and sleep, and anxiety, depression, and cost‐effectiveness. Some of the challenges and lessons that we have learned early in implementing the TelePain intervention are also reported.

AB: Background: Healthcare providers are continuously challenged to find innovative, cost‐effective alternatives and to scale up existent services to meet the growing demand upon mental health care delivery. Due to continuous advances in technologies, telepsychiatry has become an effective tool for psychiatric care. In 2012, the Institute of Psychiatry of the University of São Paulo Medical School started a randomized clinical trial of home‐based telepsychiatric outpatient care via videoconferencing. Objective: The objective of this article is to describe the design, methodology and implementation of a pilot project, which aimed to verify the applicability and efficiency of psychiatric attendance via Internet‐based videoconferencing in a resource‐constrained environment. Methods: The project consisted of a 12 months follow‐up study with a randomized clinical trial, which compared various quality indicators between home‐based telepsychiatric aftercare via videoconferencing and face‐to‐face aftercare. Results: The final sample comprised 107 outpatients (53 in the telepsychiatry group and 54 in the control group). Among 1,227 realized consultations, 489 were held by videoconferencing. Satisfaction with the aftercare by videoconferencing and the medication delivery was high among patients. Attending psychiatrists were satisfied with the assistance by videoconferencing. Discussion: The experiences during this pilot project have overall been very positive and psychiatric outpatient care by videoconferencing seems viable to treat patients even in a resource‐constrained environment.

AB: Objective Combat veterans returning to society with impairing mental health conditions such as PTSD and major depression (MD) report significant barriers to care related to aspects of traditional psychotherapy service delivery (e.g., stigma, travel time, and cost). Hence, alternate treatment delivery methods are needed. Home‐based telehealth (HBT) is one such option; however, this delivery mode has not been compared to in person, clinic‐based care for PTSD in adequately powered trials. The present study was designed to compare relative noninferiority of evidence‐based psychotherapies for PTSD and MD, specifically Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure (BA‐TE), when delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic delivery. Method A repeated measures (i.e., baseline, posttreatment, 3‐, 6‐month follow‐up) randomized controlled design powered for noninferiority analyses was used to compare PTSD and MD symptom improvement in response to BA‐TE delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic conditions. Participants were 232 veterans diagnosed with full criteria or predefined subthreshold PTSD. Results PTSD and MD symptom improvement following BA‐TE delivered by HBT was comparable to that of BA‐TE delivered in person at posttreatment and at 3‐ and 12‐month follow‐up. Conclusion Evidence‐based psychotherapy for PTSD and depression can be safely and effectively delivered via HBT with clinical outcomes paralleling those of clinic‐based care delivered in person. HBT, thereby, addresses barriers to care related to both logistics and stigma.

AB: BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Available services and intervention programs for dementia caregivers are often underutilized because of issues such as cost, logistics, lack of knowledge about available services, or insufficient support from others. Information technologies offer the potential of removing these barriers and facilitating the ability of caregivers to access needed support. This project evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of technology‐based psychosocial intervention among minority family caregivers of dementia patients. DESIGN: A feasibility and efficacy trial. SETTING: Participants' homes in the Greater Miami Community. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred ten (56 Hispanic American and 54 African American) caregivers of patients with dementia. INTERVENTION: A technology‐based multi‐component psychosocial intervention was delivered in‐home and via videophone technology over 5 months. The intervention was modeled after the REACH II intervention and targeted known areas of caregiver risk. MEASUREMENT: Standardized measures of depression, caregiver burden, social support, and the caregivers' perception of the caregiver's experience were administered at baseline and 5 months post‐randomization. RESULTS: Overall, caregivers who received the intervention reported a decrease in burden, an increase in perceived social support and positive perceptions of the caregiving experience. No effect was observed for depression. Most participants indicated that the intervention improved their caregiving skills and found the technology to be easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: A technology‐based format was feasible for delivering a multi‐component intervention to minority family dementia caregivers. The intervention improved caregiver outcomes for both Hispanic and African American caregivers. The results suggest that technology may help eliminate disparities in access to caregiver intervention programs.

AB: STUDY OBJECTIVES: Despite significant medical sequelae of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the condition remains undiagnosed and untreated in many affected individuals. We explored the feasibility of a comprehensive, telemedicine‐based OSA management pathway in a community‐based Veteran cohort. METHODS: This prospective, parallel‐group randomized pilot study assessed feasibility of a telemedicine‐based pathway for OSA evaluation and management in comparison to a more traditional, in‐person care model. The study included 60 Veterans at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center and two affiliated community‐based outpatient clinics. Telemedicine pathway feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes were assessed through a variety of quantitative (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, dropout rates, positive airway pressure [PAP] adherence rates, participant satisfaction ratings) and qualitative (verbal feedback) metrics. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in functional outcome changes, patient satisfaction, dropout rates, or objectively measured PAP adherence between groups after 3 months of treatment. Telemedicine participants showed greater improvement in mental health scores, and their feedback was overwhelmingly positive. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study suggests that telemedicine‐based management of OSA patients is feasible in terms of patient functional outcomes and overall satisfaction with care. Future studies should include larger populations to further elucidate these findings while assessing provider‐ and patient‐related cost effectiveness.

AB: Background: The role of remote physiological monitoring compared with nurse led clinics for the management of HF patients remains to be clarified. Methods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial comparing Enhanced Standard Care (ESC) delivered by a nurse led clinic versus remote monitoring of physiological parameters (RM). Inclusion criteria were one hospitalisation for HF in the preceding six months or three prior HF admissions. Following training in HF home management, patients were randomised to an ESC group managed by a nurse led heart failure clinic or to an RM Group who were issued with a device recording physiological parameters with trends checked daily by a medical officer. Evaluations in both groups included monthly health checks, NYHA status, current medications and compliance, and quality of life data. The primary outcome was the number of emergency department attendances at six months. Secondary outcomes included hospital admissions, GP visits and specialist visits. Tertiary outcomes included quality of life and cost utility.(Table Presented) Results: Therewere no significant differences in the primary outcome measure of ED presentations during six months. Conclusion: in heart failure patients with recent or frequent hospitalisation for heart failure, remote physiological monitoring failed to show any benefit on ED presentations when compared with a nurse led clinic delivering enhanced standard care.

YR: 2010
KY: Malaria
AB: Most malaria deaths occur within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, and in rural areas with poor access to health facilities, home management of malaria (HMM) can improve the timeliness of treatment and reduce malaria mortality by up to 50%. In order to maximize both coverage and impact, ACTs should be deployed in HMM programmes, as well as in formal health facilities. Up to 80% of malaria cases are treated outside the formal health sector and shops are frequently visited as the first (and in some cases only) source of treatment. Strategies to deploy ACTs in Africa thus also need to examine the role of shops in home management and to ensure that drugs sold are appropriate. The current practice of presumptive treatment of any febrile illness as malaria (both at health facilities and in the context of HMM) based solely on clinical symptoms without routine laboratory confirmation, results in significant over‐use of antimalarial drugs. With ACT being a more costly regimen, it is important to be more restrictive in its administration and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) provide a simple means of confirming malaria diagnosis in remote locations lacking electricity and qualified health staff. This study therefore proposes to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and cost‐effectiveness of using RDTs to improve malaria diagnosis and treatment by community‐based drug distributors.The accuracy of RDTs, and the acceptability of this approach, will be evaluated in both low and high transmission areas.

AB: Background: The natural fluctuation of motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) makes judgement of any change challenging and the use of clinical scales such as the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS)‐UPDRS imperative. Recently developed commodity mobile communication devices, such as smartphones, could possibly be used to assess motor symptoms in PD patients in a convenient way with low cost. We provide the first report on the development and testing of stand‐alone software for mobile devices that could be used to assess both tremor and bradykinesia of PD patients. Methods: We assessed motor symptoms with a custom‐made smartphone application in 14 patients and compared the results with their MDS‐UPDRS scores. Results: We found significant correlation between five subscores of MDS‐UPDRS (rest tremor, postural tremor, pronation‐supination, leg agility, and finger tapping) and eight parameters of the data collected with the smartphone. Conclusions: These results provide evidence as a proof of principle that smartphones could be a useful tool to objectively assess motor symptoms in PD in clinical and experimental settings.

AB: Telemedicine allows experts to assess patients in remote locations, enabling quality convenient, cost‐effective care. To help assess foot wounds remotely, we investigated the reliability of a novel optical imaging system employing a three‐dimensional camera and disposable optical marker. We first examined inter‐ and intraoperator measurement variability (correlation coefficient) of five clinicians examining three different wounds. Then, to assess of the system's ability to identify key clinically relevant features, we had two clinicians evaluate 20 different wounds at two centers, recording observations on a standardized form. Three other clinicians recorded their observations using only the corresponding three‐dimensional images. Using the in‐person assessment as the criterion standard, we assessed concordance of the remote with in‐person assessments. Measurement variation of area was 3.3% for intraoperator and 11.9% for interoperator; difference in clinician opinion about wound boundary location was significant. Overall agreement for remote vs. in‐person assessments was good, but was lowest on the subjective clinical assessments, e.g., value of debridement to improve healing. Limitations of imaging included inability to show certain characteristics, e.g., moistness or exudation. Clinicians gave positive feedback on visual fidelity. This pilot study showed that a clinician viewing only the three‐dimensional images could accurately measure and assess a diabetic foot wound remotely.

AB: The prevalence of type 1 diabetes has been steadily increasing for the past few decades and is a relatively common chronic disease of childhood (1). Managing type 1 diabetes in young children presents unique challenges to the patient, parents, and to the pediatric health care provider. The diabetes regimen includes intensive blood glucose monitoring, multiple daily injections of insulin ,and frequent insulin dose adjustments according to the amount of carbohydrate eaten, blood sugar, and physical activity. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trail (DCCT) showed a significant link between blood glucose control and a slower onset and progression of diabetes complications, with improved glycemic control decreasing the risk of micro‐ and macro‐ vascular complication (2,3,4). Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measures the In the past decade a significant progress took place in therapy and treatment of diabetes. However poor glycemic control is recorded in a significant proportion of adolescents. Telehealthcare is the use of telecommunications to deliver healthcare services and involves the remote interaction between a primary care provider and specialist. Telemedicine represents a useful and cost‐effective solution to the strict follow‐up required in diabetes management ,

AB: Background Directly observed treatment (DOT) has been the standard of care for tuberculosis since the early 1990s. In England DOT is targeted at those considered to be at high risk of poor adherence and clinically complex patients. We report the first randomised controlled trial of smartphoneenabled video observation of treatment (VOT) for active tuberculosis compared to DOT. Methods Tuberculosis patients eligible for selective DOT in England were randomised to an offer of asynchronous VOT (daily remote observation using a smartphone app) or DOT (3 or 5 times weekly observation in community or clinic settings). Results 58% of 226 randomised patients had a history of homelessness, drug use, imprisonment, alcohol or mental health problems. Of the 112 patients randomised to an offer of VOT, 70% had over 80% of scheduled observations completed over two months (the primary outcome measure) compared to 31% of 114 patients randomised to an offer of DOT (p<0.001). The effect was, in part, due to 51% of those randomised to DOT having less than one week of observation (compared to 10% of those randomised to VOT), and so not starting treatment with their allocated regimen. VOT patients sustained high observation levels throughout treatment, whereas this declined rapidly in DOT patients. We estimate that observation of a six month course of treatment with daily VOT cost £1645 per patient compared to £5700 for five times per week DOT. Conclusions VOT is a more effective and cheaper approach to observation of tuberculosis treatment than clinic or community based DOT.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Telemedicine technology contributes to the teaching of point‐of‐care ultrasound (US); however, expensive equipment can limit its deployment in resource‐challenged settings. We assessed 3 low‐cost telemedicine solutions capable of supporting remote US training to determine feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. We also explored the value of instructional videos immediately before telementoring. METHODS: Thirty‐six participants were randomly assigned to receive US mentoring in 1 of 3 telemedicine conditions: multiple fixed cameras, a smartphone, and traditional audio with a live US stream. Participants were then asked to perform a standardized US examination of the right upper quadrant under remote guidance. We measured observer's global ratings of performance along with the mentor's and student's rating of effort and satisfaction to determine which of the 3 approaches was most feasible, acceptable, and effective. During the second phase, students were randomized to watch an instructional video or not before receiving remote coaching on how to complete a subxiphoid cardiac examination. Effort, satisfaction, and performance from the independent observer's and student's perspective were surveyed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the different telemedicine setups from the observer's perspective; however, the mentor rated the smartphone significantly worse (P = .028‐.04) than other technologies. Platforms were rated equivalent from the student's perspective. No benefit was detected for watching an instructional video before the mentored task. CONCLUSIONS: Remote US skills can be taught equally effectively by using a variety of telemedicine technologies. Smartphones represent a viable option for US training in resource‐challenged settings.

AB: Objectives: As interpretation of ultrasound images is often subjective, multicenter studies are conducted to collect more objective data. Centralized image interpretation by ultrasound experts is important to enhance the credibility of diagnosis in multicenter studies. However, it is difficult to control the influence of the interpretation, on the reviewers in a face‐to‐face meeting. Also, interpreters have a limited amount of time as they perform the study tasks between daily medical practices. To solve these problems, we developed a remote interpretation system for multicenter studies in which multiple assessors could perform the interpretation and discuss the results with each other. Methods: The system was introduced for the investigator‐initiated multicenter study in Japan (JABTS BC04). We, Data Manager set up the system for each interpreter, and the imaging data were randomly allocated to several pairs of image interpreters. First, each interpreter individually evaluated the images on their site and submitted the results to the Data Center cloud. Secondly, we compared the results of each paired interpreters and gave feedback through the internet to them. The interpreters checked the results of their own partner and reconsidered the interpretation results, and submitted the final decision as a pair to the Data Center again. Results: Independent evaluation was kept systematically. Also, interpreters could perform their tasks when they had time. This reduced time and cost of conducting the Centralized image interpretation. Conclusions: The remote interpretation system is helpful to perform ultrasound multicenter studies.

AB: Some people who have a visible difference (disfigurement) experience psychosocial adjustment problems that can lead to social anxiety and isolation. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a new computerised CBT‐based intervention (Face IT) in reducing anxiety and appearance‐related distress for individuals with visible differences. Face IT was tested against a non‐intervention control group and standard CBT‐based face‐to‐face delivery. Eighty‐three participants were assessed at four time points using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales, Derriford Appearance Scale‐24, Body Image Quality of Life Inventory and Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE). The findings indicate a significant reduction in anxiety and appearance‐related distress in both the Face IT intervention and the face‐to‐face condition. Similar findings were reported for depressive symptoms and FNE. Results at the three and six months follow‐up demonstrate increased improvements in psychological functioning with both interventions. This new online psychosocial intervention has been found to be effective at reducing anxiety, depression and appearance concerns amongst individuals with disfigurements, whilst increasing positive adjustment. A remote‐access, computer‐based intervention offers the potential to provide psychosocial support more easily and in a cost‐effective manner to adults with appearance‐related distress.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the suitability of commercially available video conferencing technology and remote control software for remote programming of sound processors in Nucleus cochlear implant recipients by assessing the feasibility, efficiency, risks, and benefits of remote programming compared to face‐to‐face programming. METHODS: This was a randomized, prospective study. Seventy Nucleus implant recipients were recruited for a random sequence comparison of one remote and one local programming session each. The time required for local or remote programming was measured and resulting MAP T and C levels were compared. The recipient provided feedback on the local and remote programming session. The audiologist and monitoring clinician were asked for their feedback on remote programming. RESULTS: Remote programming sessions were successfully finished for 69 recipients. No significant differences between T and C levels obtained by local and remote programming were found. The audiologists and monitoring clinicians agreed that the remote programming system provided an acceptable level of performance after most sessions. More than 50 participating recipients considered remote programming an efficient alternative to face‐to‐face‐programming.

AB: BACKGROUND: The Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Society launched LivingWell@Home (LW@H) to provide telehealth services to clients in assisted living and home healthcare. LW@H assures client safety through remote monitoring of physiological parameters and assessment of nonbiometric parameters. Public policies increasingly support aging in place by allowing older adults with greater levels of impairment avoid or delay nursing home placement through alternative services offered in assisted living facilities and home healthcare agencies. Provider organizations face challenges caring for frail seniors with complex medical needs. Telehealth services may be helpful in supporting frail seniors living at home. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seniors were recruited into a randomized trial. Telehealth services were provided to 820 experimental subjects. Control subjects (n=762) received usual care. Clients rated their satisfaction at three points in time postimplementation: baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Fisher's exact test compared client ratings at each measurement interval. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between experimental and control subjects at baseline. Statistically significant differences emerged at follow‐up. Experimental subjects in home healthcare agencies reported higher levels of satisfaction relative to controls, whereas experimental subjects in assisted living facilities reported lower levels of satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth services increased the probability that clients will be more satisfied compared with those without telehealth in homecare agencies. The opposite effect resulted among assisted living residents. Value propositions among community‐dwelling older adults may influence their satisfaction with telehealth services postimplementation. More research is needed to examine the clinical efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of these services.

AB: Using three‐dimensional printing, we produced adaptors to attach a smartphone with camera to the eyepiece of the Airtraq laryngoscope. This low‐cost system enabled a team to simultaneously view the laryngoscopy process on the smartphone screen, and also enabled image transmission. We compared the Airtraq with the smartphone Airtraq system in a crossover study of trainee anesthesiologists performing tracheal intubation in a manikin. We also evaluated the smartphone Airtraq system for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in 30 patients, including image transmission to and communication with a remote instructor. In the manikin study, the smartphone Airtraq system enabled instruction where both trainee and instructor could view the larynx simultaneously, and did not substantially increase the time required for intubation. In the patient study, we were able to view the larynx in all 30 patients, and the remote instructor was able to receive the images and to respond on correctness of laryngoscopy and tracheal tube placement. Tracheal intubation was successful within 90s in 19 (63 %) patients. In conclusion, use of a smartphone with the Airtraq may facilitate instruction and communication of laryngoscopy with the Airtraq, overcoming some of its limitations.

AB: Using three‐dimensional printing, we produced adaptors to attach a smartphone with camera to the eyepiece of the Airtraq(®) laryngoscope. This low‐cost system enabled a team to simultaneously view the laryngoscopy process on the smartphone screen, and also enabled image transmission.

AB: PURPOSE: To address the translational research question regarding the optimal intervention "dose" to produce the most cost‐effective rate of weight loss, we conducted the Drop It At Last (DIAL) study. DESIGN: DIAL is a 6‐month pilot randomized trial to examine the efficacy of phone‐based weight loss programs with varying levels of treatment contact (10 vs. 20 sessions) in comparison to self‐directed treatment. SETTING: Participants were recruited from the community via mailings and advertisement. SUBJECTS: Participants were 63 adults with a body mass index between 30 and 39 kg/m(2). INTERVENTION: Participants received a standard set of print materials and were randomized to either: (1) self‐directed treatment; (2) 10 phone coaching sessions; or (3) 20 phone coaching sessions. MEASURES: Measured height, weight, and psychosocial and weight‐related self‐monitoring measures were collected at baseline and follow‐up. ANALYSIS: General linear models were used to examine 6‐month treatment group differences in weight loss and in psychosocial and behavioral measures. RESULTS: Weight losses were ‐2.3, ‐3.2, and ‐4.9 kg in the self‐directed, 10‐session, and 20‐session groups, respectively (p < .21). Participants who completed 10 or more sessions lost more weight (‐5.1 kg) compared to those completed four or fewer sessions (‐.3 kg, p < .04). CONCLUSION: Phone‐based weight loss program participation is associated with modest weight loss. The optimal dose and timing of intervention warrant further study.

AB: We examined the decisions made about transfer of patients with minor injuries, when telemedicine support was provided to the remote nurses in two different ways: the telemedicine doctor either used a video link, or a telephone call with viewing of digital X‐ray images (a low resolution version of Picture Archiving and Communications Systems [PACS]). A quasi‐randomized study design was used, with a panel of 20 emergency medicine doctors who independently reviewed previously‐stored consultations using the two modalities. In total, 60 case reviews were conducted during five sessions, representing 33 different cases from the routine workload of Minor Treatment Centres in Scotland. More experienced doctors transferred fewer patients than less experienced doctors. The proportion of patients transferred was higher when PACS was used than when video was used in most of the cases. A mixed effects logistic regression model was fitted to the data. The estimated odds for patient transfer were 56% lower when video was used instead of PACS (odds ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.20, 0.93). Although the cost implications are not yet known, video support for local decision‐making should remain the preferred method of telemedicine for minor injuries work.

AB: Objectives: Tele‐otoscopy has been validated for tympanostomy surveillance and remote diagnosis when recorded by trained professionals. The CellScope iPhone Otoscope allows parents to record their children's ear examinations and send the films for remote physician diagnosis. This study determines the reliability of an otolaryngologist's diagnosis by video as compared with pneumatic otoscopy when videos are taken by parents on an iPhone otoscope versus videos taken by a physician. Study Design and Setting: Prospective randomized blinded trial. Setting: Tertiary academic children's hospital. Methods: Parents of children ages 1 month to 17 years attempted recordings of the tympanic membrane of their children with the CellScope, and a physician subsequently used the device to record the same ear as well prior to office visits between September 2015 and December 2015. Later, a pediatric otolaryngologist attempted diagnosis solely based on the videos, blinded to whether the examination was filmed by a parent or physician. Interrater reliability between video diagnosis and original diagnosis on pneumatic otoscopy was measured and objective tympanic membrane landmarks visualized on the films were recorded. Results: Eighty ears were enrolled and recorded. There was moderate interrater agreement (k = 0.42) between diagnosis based on parent films as compared with pneumatic otoscopy. There was substantial agreement (k = 0.71) between diagnosis based on physician films and pneumatic otoscopy. Physician videos and parent videos had only slight agreement on objective landmarks identified (k = 0.087). Conclusions: iPhone otoscopy provides reliable cost‐effective tele‐otoscopy images in the hands of physicians, but improvement is needed for reliable parent use.

This will leverage the electronic medical record (EMR), the Penn Data Store (an electronic repository that can be used to identify study cohorts), and the NIH‐funded Way to Health platform, which provides linkages between home‐based remote monitoring devices and a server that can provide automated feedback to patients. The primary outcome will be hospital readmission rate during the 12 months of study enrollment. Secondary outcomes will include the total cost of hospitalizations. We will enroll CHF patients discharged from UPHS and randomize them to either: usual care with no additional intervention; or 1) the provision of wireless pill bottles and scales with daily lottery incentives to encourage daily adherence 2) asked to provide the name and contact information of a family member or friend to serve as their support partner 3) have their weights monitored for clinically significant threshold, with verified weight gains alerts sent to the managing physician through the EMR. Managing providers will also be sent a weekly report of weight measurements.

KY: Stroke
AB: Approximately 26% of stroke survivors are still fully dependent in activities of daily living (ADLs) when they enter the chronic phase at 6‐months post stroke, and over half have hemiparesis that impacts upper extremity motor function. Exercise and activity in the chronic phase of stroke are essential in reducing disability, improving balance, increasing mobility, and improving overall quality of life. Without regular activity and exercise in the chronic phase, survivors are at risk for a developing comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes) and experiencing a recurrent stroke. Unfortunately, people with stroke report many barriers to exercise, such as fatigue or pain, and lack of motivation and engagement. A promising solution may lie in interactive video games and virtual reality (VR), which have been used as intervention tools to potentially increase patient engagement and adherence, over the past 15 years. The investigators have developed an interactive, customized VR system called Mystic Isle that has shown to be feasible for general home‐based rehabilitation. Mystic Isle utilizes portable, low‐cost technology (the Microsoft Kinect® sensor, Microsoft) and can provide a customized program with remote monitoring by an occupational therapist (OT). This study will explore the preliminary effect of the game‐based home program on adherence to a home program in comparison to a control. It will also explore the barriers and facilitators to home use of a virtual reality‐based intervention.

AB: Introduction. There are some clinical trials showing that shortterm ischemia in one organ can protect different organs against higher intensity and longer ischemic insult. We designed a study to assess whether remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on one organ can decrease the rate of contrast‐induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in diabetic patients who undergo coronary artery angiography (CAA). Materials and Methods. This randomized control trial included 96 diabetic patients who were candidates for CAA. Exclusion criteria were congestive heart failure and complications during CAA. All of the patients received 1000 mL of normal saline before CAA. The RIPC group underwent 3 cycles of 5‐minute ischemia in their right arm. Serum creatinine was measured before and 24 hours after CAA. Results. Contrast‐induced AKI was reported in 5 cases in the control group and 1 case in the RIPC group (P =.13, odds ratio, 5.4). The differences in serum creatinine level before and after the procedure was significantly lower in RIPC group than that in the control group (P =.04, odds ratio, 0.08). Serum creatinine rise significantly correlated with contrast dose (P =.02) and a history of hypertension (P =.02) in both groups. Conclusions. Ischemic preconditioning had a protective effect on contrast‐induced AKI in our study. Since this method is harmless and cost effective, further studies on patients with chronic kidney disease is required to evaluate addition of ischemic preconditioning to our clinical practice for prevention of contrast‐induced AKI.

AB: The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's (AAPD) guidelines (2017) stated that Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a brush‐on liquid that arrest 87.7% of dental caries lesions. The success rate is similar for restorations placed under GA. One of the most exciting aspects of SDF is the 67±4% decrease in new lesions on untreated surfaces, achieved simply by treating active lesions .This is not the same as incidence of any new lesions (elaborated above for treatment under GA), however the relation warrants further investigation. Benefit to the patient ‐ No pain and infection. ‐ Enhance child cooperation. ‐ Enhance better patient compliance. ‐ Decrease cost of dental treatment and may eliminate the need for General Anesthesia. Benefit to the dentist ‐ Develop an effective fast easy method to arrest the caries by using SDF. ‐ Ease of dental treatment. ‐ Better cooperation with the child. ‐ The procedure is simple. ‐ Inexpensive and non‐invasive. ‐ It does not require expensive equipment or support infrastructure, such as pipe water or electricity. Benefit to the population ‐ Reduce the harmful impact of oral health problems in preschool children from low income families. ‐ SDF can be considered a user‐friendly material for use in dental clinics as well as remote areas, schools or deprived communities. Children aged 2‐5 years can benefit from the use of SDF, an easy anticaries treatment. Furthermore, children in this age group may benefit from delayed dental treatment and overall caries arrest, thus reducing potential pain and infection, expensive future emergency room visits, the need for general anesthesia or traumatic dental experiences on uncooperative children.

KY: Coronary Artery Disease; Ischemia; Myocardial Ischemia
AB: Several randomized trials suggested a cardioprotective beneficial effect (eg reduction in cardiac troponin release) of remote ischemic preconditioning in cardiac surgery. Remote ischemic preconditioning by brief episodes of ischemia and reperfusion in a remote organ or vascular territory provides protection from injury by myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. In the translation of remote ischemic preconditioning from bench to bedside, the first proof of principle and small randomized controlled trials have shown a decreased release of myocardial biomarkers after aortic, congenital cardiac, adult valve and coronary artery by‐pass graft surgery. This reduction in cardiac biomarkers release translated into better survival in a recent randomized trial performed in cardiac surgery. No clinical trial on remote ischemic preconditioning in non‐cardiac surgery setting has been performed so far. The investigators study wants to test, for the first time, the hypothesis that remote ischaemic preconditioning is effective in reducing cardiac damage in high risk patients undergoing non‐cardiac surgery. Remote ischaemic preconditioning will be achieved by inflation of a blood‐pressure cuff to 200 mm Hg to the upper arm for 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes reperfusion while the cuff will be deflated. Cardiac troponin will be used as marker of cardiac damage. If the results of a reduction in postoperative cardiac troponin release and perioperative cardiac ischaemic events will be confirmed in a non‐cardiac surgery setting, the investigators could improve a strategy to prevent perioperative cardiac complication easy to apply, safe and low cost.

KY: Motor Neuron Disease
AB: Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rare but debilitating neurological condition that causes paralysis of the body's muscles leading to severe disability and eventually death. Patients often struggle to travel the long distances to specialist clinics to receive the care they require whilst this expert care is often unavailable in the community. Telehealth has the potential to enable a specialist team to monitor the health and wellbeing of patients and their carers whilst they are at home. This could improve the patient's health, improve the quality of life of both patients and their carers, and lead to more effective use of health resources. This is a randomised controlled pilot study that will involve 40 patients who are cared for by the Sheffield Motor Neurone Disease care centre and their main informal carer (a total of 80 participants). Half of the participants will use the telehealth system for a minimum of six months and maximum of eighteen months and information will be collected from patients, carers and their care team. This will include collecting clinical outcome measures, health resource use and the opinions and experience of using the system. All participants will continue to receive their usual care. This is a pilot study. It aims to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the telehealth system to patients, carers and their health care providers. It also aims to determine how a larger trial could successfully evaluate the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of the system.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that Diabeo software enabling individualized insulin dose adjustments combined with telemedicine support significantly improves HbA(1c) in poorly controlled type 1 diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a six‐month open‐label parallel‐group, multicenter study, adult patients (n = 180) with type 1 diabetes (>1 year), on a basal‐bolus insulin regimen (>6 months), with HbA(1c) ≥ 8%, were randomized to usual quarterly follow‐up (G1), home use of a smartphone recommending insulin doses with quarterly visits (G2), or use of the smartphone with short teleconsultations every 2 weeks but no visit until point end (G3). RESULTS: Six‐month mean HbA(1c) in G3 (8.41 ± 1.04%) was lower than in G1 (9.10 ± 1.16%; P = 0.0019). G2 displayed intermediate results (8.63 ± 1.07%). The Diabeo system gave a 0.91% (0.60; 1.21) improvement in HbA(1c) over controls and a 0.67% (0.35; 0.99) reduction when used without teleconsultation. There was no difference in the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes or in medical time spent for hospital or telephone consultations. However, patients in G1 and G2 spent nearly 5 h more than G3 patients attending hospital visits. CONCLUSIONS: The Diabeo system gives a substantial improvement to metabolic control in chronic, poorly controlled type 1 diabetic patients without requiring more medical time and at a lower overall cost for the patient than usual care.

AB: Obesity [Body mass index (BMI kg/m2 ≥ 95th percentile)] affects 1 in 5 adolescents in the United States, with 13 million suffering from severe obesity (BMI ≥ 120% > 95th percentile or ≥ 35 mg/kg2). Adolescents are able to lose weight with behavioral changes in diet and physical activity, but change in these behaviors requires self‐monitoring and support, and weight loss is not always successful. Parent involvement and parent weight‐loss can help their children to lose weight and successfully change their behavior. Guidance from pediatricians can also help to facilitate weight loss among obese adolescents. That said, treatment of obesity through behavior change within the time constraints of a Pediatric practice visit is limited by treatment adherence and clinic visit attendance. Therefore, finding cost‐effective, timely, methods to keep adolescents with severe obesity engaged in therapy outside of standard practice is a critical need. The effects of monetary incentives through games (gamification), and a comprehensive remote digital monitoring system on sleep, physical activity, and dietary intake, has been successful in adults, but has not been tested in adolescents with obesity.

AB: Objectives: We aimed to assess the impact on depot medroxyprogesterone continuation when a large care provider, Planned Parenthood, was banned from a state‐funded family planning program. Methods: We compared the proportion of patients returning to Planned Parenthood for injectable contraception immediately after the ban (January 1, 2013 to April 30, 2013) to prior‐year numbers in a major Texas metropolis. We also examined the impact of the ban in a smaller, remote Texas city. We placed these findings in context by interviewing 224 nonreturning patients by phone about barriers to care. Results: In spring 2013, 14.4% of major metropolitan clients and 64.8% of nonmetropolitan clients returned to Planned Parenthood for the injection. Among148 nonreturning interviewees who remained covered under the family planning program, 80% obtained the dose, but only 56.8% did so at no cost and on time. More than 14% got a late dose. By comparison, in the corresponding months of 2012 in the major metropolis, 92% of injectable contraception patients received a dose on time, and just 7.4% got a late dose. Immediately after the ban, more than one in five women missed a dose because of barriers, most commonly having to find another provider. Outcomes: Injectable contraceptive use was disrupted during the rollout of the state‐funded family planning program. Women living outside the major metropolis encountered increased barriers.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ScriptAssist, a telehealth nursing program using psychological techniques, reduced emergency department (ED) utilization and improved adherence among Medicaid health plan members with serious and persistent mental illness (SPMI). STUDY DESIGN: Nonrandomized controlled trial. METHODS: Of 210 eligible Medicaid health plan members with SPMI, 59 (28%) were contacted by phone and 51 (86%) participated. Participants received an average of 3.5 calls over 9 months, with 2.1 attempts per completed call. Participants had clinically significant levels of impairment; medication switching, polypharmacy, and medical comorbidities were common. Intervention group participants' results were compared with those of nonparticipants to rule out regression to the mean, history, and maturation effects. Intervention group participants' results also were compared with baseline data to rule out selection bias. RESULTS: Program participants had fewer ED visits during the intervention than a comparison group, and reduced their ED use and hospitalization rate compared with the previous year. Participants also had better medication adherence based on pharmacy and interview data. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive‐behavioral and motivational‐interviewing techniques can improve antipsychotic medication adherence. Telehealth may be a useful strategy for disseminating these evidence‐based techniques. Lessons learned included the importance of real‐time referral data, a need to address polypharmacy, and a need to overcome contact difficulties resulting from disease processes and "unknown caller" IDs. Despite these difficulties, using a disease management model, the program was feasible, and the reduced number of ED visits indicated potential cost‐effectiveness.

AB: Background: Subthreshold depression and anxiety are common in the growing population of visually impaired older adults and increase the risk of full‐blown depressive or anxiety disorders. Adequate treatment may prevent the development of depression or anxiety in this high risk group.Method/design: A stepped‐care programme was developed based on other effective interventions and focus groups with professionals and patient representatives of three low vision rehabilitation organisations in the Netherlands and Belgium. The final programme consists of four steps: 1) watchful waiting, 2) guided self‐help, 3) problem solving treatment, 4) referral to general practitioner. The (cost‐)effectiveness of this programme is evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. Patients (N = 230) are randomly assigned to either a treatment group (stepped‐care) or a control group (usual care). The primary outcome is the incidence of depressive and anxiety disorders, measured with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).Discussion: Preventive interventions for depression and anxiety have received little attention in the field of low vision. A stepped‐care programme that focuses on both depression and anxiety has never been investigated in visually impaired older adults before. If the intervention is shown to be effective, this study will result in an evidence based treatment programme to prevent depression or anxiety in patients from low vision rehabilitation organisations. The pragmatic design of the study greatly enhances the generalisability of the results. However, a possible limitation is the difficulty to investigate the contribution of each individual step. 2013 van der Aa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB: Introduction: Annual screening for pediatric diabetic retinopathy (DR) is recommended by the ADA for type 1 diabetes starting at age 10, once duration of diabetes is over 3‐5 years, and starting at diagnosis of type 2. We instituted a telemedicine program for pediatric DR and analyzed epidemiologic and disease factors of screened children. Methods: Retrospective chart review. Results: Over 1 year, 494 childreen meeting ADA criteria for ophthalmic evaluation had non‐mydriatic fundus screening in the diabetes clinic in an ongoing program. Prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 8.3%. The first twenty‐nine patients with abnormal Results: were compared to 35 randomly selected normals. Duration of diabetes (median of 12 and 7 years in the abnormal and normal groups respectively, P = 0.003) and age (median of 17 and 16 respectively, P = 0.04) were different in univariate analysis (Wilcoxon test). Average A1c, duration of disease, age and sex showed some importance as predictors of an abnormal screening, but none reached statistical significance in a penalized logistic regression model, likely due to limited power. Discussion: The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in children screened is substantially higher than that previously reported from retrospective reviews of eye clinic records, likely due to poor compliance of most‐at‐risk children with formal eye examination. This program has decreased the number of children needing eye examinations by 90% compared to ADA recommendations. Conclusions: Telemedicine is an attractive and cost‐effective means of evaluating children at risk for diabetic retinopathy.

AB: Due to treatment accessibility and cost issues, interest in self‐help programs (e.g., bibliotherapy, telehealth) for common psychological disorders is growing. Research supporting the efficacy of such a program for social anxiety, however, is limited. The present study examined the efficacy of an 8‐week self‐directed cognitive behavioral treatment with minimal therapist involvement for social phobia based on a widely available self‐help book. Twenty‐one adults with social phobia initially received either treatment (i.e. assigned readings in the workbook with limited therapist contact) or were wait‐listed. Wait‐listed patients eventually received the same self‐directed treatment. Results revealed that the self‐help/minimal therapist contact treatment was superior to wait‐list on most outcome measures. Across the entire sample, reductions in social anxiety, global severity, general anxiety, and depression were observed at posttest and 3‐month follow‐up. These findings provide preliminary support for using this self‐help workbook for individuals with mild to moderate social anxiety in conjunction with infrequent therapist visits to reinforce the treatment principles. Study limitations and future directions are discussed.

AB: Background/introduction With an ever decreasing financial envelope, sexual health services are being tasked with developing more cost effective ways of managing patients without impacting on quality of care. Centralised patient management systems have reduced the need for face to face contact, using virtual systems, based upon Health and Social Care information Centre (HSCI) definitions, to manage ongoing care for patients including partner notification. Aim(s)/objectives Analyse virtual management undertaken with patients following new attendance for episodes of STI care. To ascertain and categorise the number of virtual contacts that prevented a face to face follow up attendance. Methods Thematic analysis was performed on a randomised sample of telephone consultations definitions between 04/15 and 01/16 Results 82,994 calls were made to automated results systems. 13,373 calls were transferred from the automated system. Discussion/Conclusion The automated system manages 82% of calls without patients opting to speak with clinicians. Significant numbers of patients opted for telephone consultation upon notification of an infection, giving opportunity for initiation of PN alongside management of further testing and treatment. Approaching 1/4 of consultations analysed, showed no additional testing or treatment was indicated, but advice and reassurance was the primary reason for speaking with staff. Virtual consultations can provide a high quality alternative to face to face follow‐ up visits. (Table Presented).

AB: BACKGROUND: Physically active lessons integrating movement into academic content are a way to increase children's physical activity levels. Virtual Traveller was a physically active lesson intervention set in Year 4 (aged 8‐9) primary school classes in Greater London, UK. Implemented by classroom teachers, it was a six‐week intervention providing 10‐min physically active Virtual Field Trips three times a week. The aim of this paper is to report the process evaluation of the Virtual Traveller randomized controlled trial according to RE‐AIM framework criteria (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance). METHODS: A mixed methods approach to evaluation was conducted with five intervention group classes. Six sources of data were collected via informed consent logs, teacher session logs, teacher and pupil questionnaires, teacher interviews and pupil focus groups. RESULTS: High participation and low attrition rates were identified (Reach) alongside positive evaluations of Virtual Traveller sessions from pupil and teachers (Effectiveness). Participants were from more deprived and ethnic backgrounds than local and national averages, with Virtual Traveller having the potential to be a free intervention (Adoption). 70% of sessions were delivered overall (Implementation) but no maintenance of the programme was evident at three month follow‐up (Maintenance). CONCLUSIONS: Mixed method evaluation of Virtual Traveller showed potential for it to be implemented as a low‐cost physically active lesson intervention in UK primary schools.

AB: BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to prescribed medication regimens is a substantial barrier to the pharmacological management of alcohol use disorders. The availability of low‐cost, sustainable interventions that maximize medication adherence would likely lead to improved treatment outcomes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies are increasingly being adopted as a method of delivering behavioral health interventions and represent a promising tool for adherence interventions. We are evaluating a cell‐phone‐based intervention called AGATE that seeks to enhance adherence with regular text‐messaging. METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized controlled effectiveness trial in the context of an eight‐week open label naltrexone efficacy trial delivered in a naturalistic clinical setting. Treatment‐seeking heavy drinkers (N = 105) are currently being recruited and randomly assigned to the AGATE intervention or a control condition. Daily measures of alcohol use and medication side effects are being recorded via cell phone in both conditions. Additionally, participants randomized to the AGATE condition receive medication reminders via SMS text message according to a schedule that adjusts according to their level of adherence. DISCUSSION: Results from this trial will provide initial information about the feasibility and efficacy of mHealth interventions for improving adherence to alcohol pharmacotherapies.

AB: Objective: The effectiveness of shared care combined with telecare in type 2 diabetes patients in an underserved community has not been investigated in Asia. We aimed to investigate this issue. Methods: A total of 95 patients with type 2 diabetes who had hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 7% for at least 1 year were recruited from six community health centers in remote Changhua County, Taiwan. All patients were randomly divided into intervention (shared care combined with telecare) and usual care groups for 6 months. Hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and lipid profiles were checked at baseline and study end. Results: The decrease in HbA1c level was significantly greater in the intervention group than in the usual care group (0.7% + 1.3% versus 0.1% + 1.0%; p = .03, after adjusting sex, age, and body mass index) after 6 months of shared care and telecare programs. There were no significant differences in lipid profiles and blood pressure changes between these two groups. Conclusions: Shared care combined with telecare could significantly reduce HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetes patients with poor glycemic control in rural, underserved communities. However, further studies should be conducted to clarify the target users and to develop cost‐effective and personalized interventions.

AB: BACKGROUND: People with bipolar disorder (BD) experience additional parenting challenges associated with mood driven fluctuations in communication, impulse control and motivation. This paper describes a novel web‐based self‐management approach (Integrated Bipolar Parenting Intervention; IBPI) to support parents with BD. RESULTS: Ninety seven participants were recruited with 98% retention to end of intervention and 90% to final follow‐up (56%‐94% data analysed of retained participants; higher rates for observer measures). 77% of IBPI participants accessed the website (53% accessed parenting modules). Child behaviour, parenting sense of competence and parenting stress improved significantly in IBPI compared to WL to end of intervention, sustained to 48 weeks. Impacts of IBPI on family functioning, parent mood and time to mood relapse were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Online self‐management support for parents with BD is feasible, with promising improvements in parenting and child behaviour outcomes. A definitive clinical and cost‐effectiveness trial is required to confirm and extend these findings. METHOD: Parents with BD with children aged 3‐10 years randomised to IBPI plus treatment as usual (TAU) or waitlist control (WL). IBPI offered 16 weeks access to interactive self‐management information concerning BD and parenting issues. Feasibility was through recruitment, retention and web usage. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 16, 24, 36 and 48 weeks. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN75279027. Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

YR: 2013
KY: Brain Injuries
AB: Aerobic exercise holds a multitude of health benefits. Studies in mice have shown that aerobic exercise improves memory, and increases the volume of the hippocampus, the brain's primary memory center. Only two studies have been conducted in humans, one in healthy elders, and the other in a schizophrenia population. So far, there has never been an aerobic exercise trial in traumatic brain injury (TBI) to look at hippocampal volume and memory as outcomes of interest. The proposed project is a randomized controlled trial of aerobic exercise in persons with TBI. We will conduct a 12‐week (36 sessions) program of aerobic exercise (stationary cycling), versus a control condition of non‐aerobic exercise (stretching), in memory‐impaired TBI patients to a) increase hippocampal volume and b) improve memory. Importantly, we also expect benefits of aerobic exercise on the level of brain function. Specifically, we will look at 'functional connectivity,' which refers to how efficiently remote regions of the brain 'talk' to each other. TBI is an ideal population to benefit from aerobic exercise, given the young age at which many individuals sustain TBI, which allows for benefits of aerobic exercise to be maximally realized in a population with sufficient neurofunctional reserve. The expected benefits of aerobic exercise (increased hippocampal volume, improved memory) from this intervention stand to have a meaningful impact on people with TBI, including improved health, productivity, independence, and quality of life. And, unlike current treatments for memory impairment (e.g., pharmacological agents, cognitive rehabilitation), aerobic exercise is a cost‐effective, all natural, readily‐available treatment for memory problems.

AB: AIMS: There is a critical need to reduce infectious disease transmission among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Here we examine the ability of a novel, automated educational intervention, delivered via iPad in a single visit, to improve human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) knowledge among adults with OUD. METHODS: Participants were 25 adults enrolled in a 12‐week trial evaluating the efficacy of an Interim Buprenorphine Treatment for reducing illicit opioid use and other risk behaviors during delays to opioid treatment. Participants completed baseline HIV and HCV knowledge assessments with corrective feedback. They then completed an interactive HIV flipbook and HCV video followed by a second administration of the knowledge assessments. The knowledge assessments were repeated at post‐intake Weeks 4 and 12. RESULTS: At baseline, participants answered 69% and 65% of items correctly on the HIV and HCV assessments, respectively. The educational intervention was associated with significant increases in knowledge (86% and 86% correct on the HIV and HCV assessments, respectively; p's<.001). These improvements persisted throughout the study, with scores at Week 4 and 12 significantly greater than baseline (p's<.001). CONCLUSION: This HIV+Hepatitis Education intervention was associated with significant and sustained improvements in knowledge of HIV + HCV transmission and risk behaviors in this vulnerable group of individuals with OUD. Given the continuing opioid epidemic, efforts are urgently needed to reduce HIV and HCV contraction and transmission among individuals with OUD. Mobile health educational interventions may offer a time‐ and cost‐effective approach for addressing these risks.

AB: Mental disorders account for 25% of all health‐related disability worldwide. More patients receive treatment for mental disorders in the primary care sector than in the mental health specialty setting. However, brief visits, inadequate reimbursement, deficits in primary care provider (PCP) training, and competing demands often limit the capacity of the PCP to produce optimal outcomes in patients with common mental disorders. More than 80 randomized trials have shown the benefits of collaborative care (CC) models for improving outcomes of patients with depression and anxiety. Six key components of CC include a population‐based approach, measurement‐based care, treatment to target strategy, care management, supervision by a mental health professional (MHP), and brief psychological therapies. Multiple trials have also shown that CC for depression is equally or more cost‐effective than many of the current treatments for medical disorders. Factors that may facilitate the implementation of CC include a more favorable alignment of medical and mental health services in accountable care organizations and patient‐centered medical homes; greater use of telecare as well as automated outcome monitoring; identification of patients who might benefit most from CC; and systematic training of both PCPs and MHPs in integrated team‐based care.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Electronic screening and brief intervention has been identified as a low cost strategy to address marijuana use among students, however there is little known about who may be most responsive to this intervention approach. This study examined whether readiness‐to‐change moderated the influence of a web‐based intervention on frequency of use at 3‐month outcomes. METHODS: One‐hundred twenty‐three students who smoked marijuana at least monthly were identified by screening in a student health center. Baseline and 3‐month outcome assessments were conducted on‐line. Participants were randomly assigned to either eCHECKUP TO GO‐marijuana or a control condition after completing marijuana measures and the Readiness‐to‐Change Questionnaire (RTCQ). Negative binomial regression analyses were conducted to examine whether the effect of the intervention on marijuana use at 3‐month outcomes was moderated by the Action and Problem Recognition dimensions of the RTCQ, adjusting for baseline use. RESULTS: Analyses showed a significant Intervention × Action interaction. Probing of interaction effects showed that among those with high scores on the Action scale participants in the intervention group reported significantly fewer days of use than those in the control condition at follow‐up (IRR=0.53, 95%CI: 0.94, 2.08). The Problem Recognition dimension did not moderate the influence of the intervention on outcomes. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that this eSBI may bolster change efforts among students who have begun taking steps toward changing their marijuana use.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Older adults with multiple chronic conditions face the complex task of medication management involving multiple medications of varying doses at different times. Advances in telehealth technologies have resulted in home‐based devices for medication management and health monitoring of older adults. We examined older adults' perceptions of a telehealth medication dispensing device as part of a clinical trial involving home healthcare clients, nurse coordination and use of the medication dispensing device. METHODS: Ninety‐six frail older adult participants who used the medication dispensing device for 12 months completed a satisfaction survey related to perceived usefulness and reliability. Results were analyzed and grouped by themes in the following areas: Ease of Use, Reliability, Medication Management Assistance, Routine Task Performance and Acceptability. RESULTS: Nearly all participants perceived the medication dispensing device as very easy to use, very reliable and helpful in the management of their medications. Eighty‐four percent of participants expressed a desire to use the machine in the future. CONCLUSION: The technology‐enhanced medication management device in this study is an acceptable tool for older adults to manage medication in collaboration with home care nurses. Improved usability and cost models for medication dispensers are areas for future research.

AB: Improving mid‐term and long‐term outcomes after solid organ transplantation is imperative, and requires both state‐of‐the‐art transplant surgery and optimization of routine, evidence‐based aftercare. This randomized, controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of standard aftercare versus telemedically supported case management, an innovative aftercare model, in 46 living‐donor renal transplant recipients during the first posttransplant year. The model includes three components: (i) chronic care case management initiated after discharge, (ii) case management initiated in emerging acute care situations, and (iii) a telemedically equipped team comprising a transplant nurse case manager and two senior transplant physicians (nephrologist, surgeon). Analyses revealed a reduction of unplanned inpatient acute care, with considerable cost reductions, in the intervention group. The prevalence of nonadherence over the 1‐year study period was 17.4% in the intervention group versus 56.5% in the standard aftercare group (p = 0.013). Only the intervention group achieved their pre‐agreed levels of adherence, disease‐specific quality of life, and return to employment. This comparative effectiveness study provides the basis for multicenter study testing of telemedically supported case management with the aim of optimizing posttransplant aftercare. The trial was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (www.DRKS.de), DKRS00007634.

AB: BACKGROUND: Diabetes outcomes are worse for underserved patients from certain ethnic/racial minority populations. Telephonic disease management is a cost‐effective strategy to deliver self‐management services and possibly improve diabetes outcomes for such patients. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a trial to test the effectiveness of a supplemental telephonic disease management program compared to usual care alone for patients with diabetes cared for in a community health center. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: All patients had type 2 diabetes, and the majority was Hispanic or African American. Most were urban‐dwelling with low socioeconomic status, and nearly all had Medicaid or were uninsured. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical measures included glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid levels, and body mass index. Validated surveys were used to measure dietary habits and physical activity. RESULTS: A total of 146 patients were randomized to the intervention and 149 to the control group. Depressive symptoms were highly prevalent in both groups. Using an intention to treat analysis, there were no significant differences in the primary outcome (HbA1c) between the intervention and control groups at 12 months. There were also no significant differences for secondary clinical or behavioral outcome measures including BMI, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, smoking, or intake of fruits and vegetables, or physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: A clinic‐based telephonic disease management support for underserved patients with diabetes did not improve clinical or behavioral outcomes at 1 year as compared to patients receiving usual care alone.

AB: OBJECTIVES: While telephone care management has shown promise as a cost‐effective approach to manage patients with depression, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of this method for Medicaid beneficiaries in managed care. This study examines a 1‐year telephone care management intervention designed to help this low‐income, hard‐to‐reach population enter and remain engaged with treatment. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial of 499 Rhode Island Medicaid managed care beneficiaries with depression (all parents, average age of 35, and 90% women). Care managers conducted telephonic outreach with the intervention group to establish a relationship, initiate treatment, make referrals for in‐person psychotherapy and/or medication treatment, and monitor treatment progress. The control group received usual care and was given a referral list of providers participating in the Medicaid program. METHODS: Primary outcomes were the use of health services and depression severity at 6 and 18 months. Administrative claims provided information on medical and mental health services use. Surveys of sample members provided information on depression severity. Analysis controlling for sociodemographic characteristics was done to assess the effectiveness of providing care management. RESULTS: Care managers contacted 91% of those assigned to the intervention group. The intervention was effective in enrolling participants into mental health services (42% in intervention group vs 31% in control; P = .05), but did not successfully reduce average depression severity. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention's lack of success in reducing depression severity for Medicaid beneficiaries suggests the need for more intensive interventions that strengthen telephone care management and potentially include in‐person components as well.

KY: Heart Failure
AB: Heart failure (HF) epidemic is an aggressively developing phenomenon, stimulated by developing civilization and generating worrying economic and social effects. Early comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation (CCR) is an accepted method of preventing and treating adverse cardiac events, which allows for care cost reduction. In Poland, CCR availability is highly unsatisfactory (around 8%) and unacceptably varied (0.5‐70%). With the existing organization and technical background, improving this situation seems impossible. Project objective: To apply telemedicine technologies to implement a novel model of home‐based CCR in HF patients. The program, performed in six centers, will comprise 850 HF patients (randomization 1:1), in NYHA class I‐III, EF≤40%, clinically stable, after a hospitalization incident. The study group patients will undergo a 9‐week rehabilitation program consisting of two stages: Stage I ‐ preliminary (one week at stationary ward), Stage II ‐ main (8 weeks of home‐based telerehabilitation). The primary end‐point (days alive and out of hospital) will be assessed during a 24‐month follow‐up in both groups. The project will enable early secondary prevention in the population of people with HF to be implemented. It will be achieved via: ‐ Novel concept ‐ "From Hospital To Home" ‐ Novel technology ‐ telemedicine ‐ Novel method of CCR implementation

AB: The need exist for continued research to find the use of home made mouthwashes in preventing periodontal diseases. Although, Chlorhexidine mouthwash is regarded as Gold standard mouthwash as antiplaque but have some limitations like cost factor and side effects like staining of teeth, loss of taste, oral mucosal ulcerations,paresthesia and may enhanced supragingival calculus formation. Use of various indigenous products and home made preparations are easily available and are being used since ancient time in India and still in practice in various parts of India especially rural and remote areas. At the same time the use of potassium permanganate is still in practice in various parts of India and also it was in practice before the availability of Chlorhexidine, povidone iodine and other antiseptic solutions, as they are used since about 30 years only. Use of hot salt water rinsing is in practice especially to reduce the symptoms of various throat infections such as pharyngitis, tonsillitis and also to improve oral hygiene.It is also being used in oral surgery and their effects are also mention in literature. Hence, the aim of this study is to assess and compare the efficacy of home made remedies like hot salt water and potassium permanganate as a mouthwash in reducing Plaque accumulation and improving Gingival conditions with Gold standard Chlorhexidine mouthwash if found effective may be used as affordable mouthwash for the benefit of population of India.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Although cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) represents the first‐line evidence‐based psychotherapy for bulimia nervosa (BN), most individuals seeking treatment do not have access to this specialized intervention. We compared an Internet‐based manualized version of CBT group therapy for BN conducted via a therapeutic chat group (CBT4BN) to the same treatment conducted via a traditional face‐to‐face group therapy (CBTF2F). METHOD: In a two‐site, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial, we tested the hypothesis that CBT4BN would not be inferior to CBTF2F. A total of 179 adult patients with BN (2.6% males) received up to 16 sessions of group CBT over 20 weeks in either CBT4BN or CBTF2F, and outcomes were compared at the end of treatment and at the 12‐month follow‐up. RESULTS: At the end of treatment, CBT4BN was inferior to CBTF2F in producing abstinence from binge eating and purging. However, by the 12‐month follow‐up, CBT4BN was mostly not inferior to CBTF2F. Participants in the CBT4BN condition, but not CBTF2F, continued to reduce their binge‐eating and purging frequency from the end of treatment to the 12‐month follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: CBT delivered online in a group chat format appears to be an efficacious treatment for BN, although the trajectory of recovery may be slower than face‐to‐face group therapy. Online chat groups may increase accessibility of treatment and represent a cost‐effective approach to service delivery. However, barriers in service delivery such as state‐specific license and ethical guidelines for online therapists need to be addressed.

AB: Background and purpose: Telemedicine is gaining popularity for a variety of indications. We performed a randomized controlled trial comparing telemedical versus conventional clinic follow‐up in terms of feasibility and quality. Methods: Patients discharged from pediatric surgery were randomized to telemedical or onsite follow‐up. In the telemedical group, video telephony was used to obtain interim history and physical findings. Onsite patients were personally seen in the outpatient clinic. Caregivers completed a postvisit survey on satisfaction and efficiency. Providers scored data transmission quality and clinical interpretability. Results: From March 2015 until January 2017, 224 patients were randomized equally to the study groups. Telemedicine was highly accepted by caregivers, and data transmission quality was sufficient for comprehensive follow‐up. No important clinical findings were missed. Quality of interaction scored higher in the telemedical versus the onsite group (77.8% vs. 48%, p < 0.001) as did caregiver satisfaction (5.4 vs. 5.1, p < 0.03). Travel investment, time required, loss of earnings, and days off from work/school were all significantly lower in the telemedical group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Telemedical posthospitalization follow‐up in pediatric surgery provides a cost‐effective, time‐saving alternative for patients and caregivers that is well received and accepted. The quality of clinical data transmission is sufficient to provide safe care and uncompromised clinical judgment. Type of study: Prospective and randomized controlled study. Level of evidence: Level 1b.

AB: Purpose: The Institute of Medicine has made research on pain conditions among its highest priorities due to high prevalence and cost. Health professionals' primary role for chronic pain should be guiding, coaching, and assisting patients with day‐to‐day self‐management. However, they often lack the time and training to perform this role, and there is limited research on self‐management approaches. This transformative care model integrates robust self‐management online training with health and wellness tele‐coaching to improve outcomes from self‐management of chronic pain. Results: Eighty‐one subjects were randomized to PACTand TSC, 1 subject withdraw from the study. Mean age was 47 (SD=16), 86% were female, and 82% had pain onset of 1 year or more. Participants showed significant improvement in measures of pre‐post change at 8 weeks for pain severity (PACT ‐.94 vs TSC ‐0.5), but not for pain interference or jaw functioning (16 week follow‐up data are still in collection at the time of this submission but will be completed and included at the time of the conference). Conclusions: This research demonstrated that transformative care model that includes tele‐health coaching and online training is both feasible and effective. It provides an accessible, scalable, and transferable method for self‐management that can be integrated into routine care without increasing the burden of time demands upon the providers.

AB: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the impact of telephone counseling on quality of life in patients with coronary artery bypass graft. METHODS: A quasi‐experimental study was conducted with 71 discharged patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery at Ekbatan Edcuational hospital in Hamadan, Iran, in 2014. The patients were randomly allocated into intervention (n=36) and control group (n=35). The intervention group received education and counseling about therapeutic plan via telephone after discharge. Patients in the control group received only routines. All patients completed the quality of life questionnaire before and after the intervention period of five weeks. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between intervention and control group about quality of life before intervention (p=0.696). However, there was significant and positive deference between the two groups in favor of the telephone counseling after the intervention (P=0.01) and control group (P=0.04). Quality of life in the intervention group was significantly better compared to control group (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Telephone counseling could be a cost‐effective patient counseling plan for therapeutic adherence after coronary artery bypass surgery in order to improve the patients' quality of life. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Telephone counseling is feasible to implement and well accepted for patient counseling for many diseases.

YR: 2011
AB: Communication between physicians caring for hospitalized patients and those patients' primary care providers (PCPs) is often suboptimal. Hospital‐based information systems can improve communication by automating information exchange between hospital physicians and PCPs, and perhaps, as a result, improve the quality and safety of health care. MedTrak, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) electronic physician communication tool, has proven successful and is poised to move forward with an initiative the investigators call virtual continuity, allowing PCPs to follow their patients electronically if they cannot do so physically. Virtual continuity will include: emails to PCPs triggered by clinical events with embedded links to electronic medical record data and communication portals, medication lists electronically delivered to PCPs at admission and discharge, and immediate PCP notification of discharge with pertinent clinical details. To evaluate virtual continuity, the investigators will examine the frequency of discharge medication errors in complex medical patients using a pre‐post study design of virtual continuity compared to usual communication. Medication errors will be ascertained using accepted methods. The investigators will also investigate differences in rehospitalization, post discharge emergency department visit and PCP follow up rates. The IT cost of implementing and maintaining the virtual continuity intervention will also be assessed. Virtual continuity will allow PCPs to participate more directly in the care of their hospitalized patients. Improved communication could lead to higher‐quality patient care and greater patient care safety for hospitalized patients with complex medical problems.

AB: Workplace interventions have shown beneficial results of resistance training for chronic pain in the neck, shoulder, and arm. However, studies have relied on experienced exercise instructors, which may not be an available resource at most workplaces. The objective of this study is to evaluate the technical performance level of upper limb rehabilitation exercises following video‐based versus personalized exercise instruction. We recruited 38 laboratory technicians and office workers with neck/shoulder pain for a two‐week exercise training period receiving either (1) personal and video or (2) video only instruction in four typical neck/shoulder/arm rehabilitation exercises using elastic tubing. At a 2‐week follow‐up, the participants' technical execution was assessed by two blinded physical therapists using a reliable error assessment tool. The error assessment was based on ordinal deviation of joint position from the ideal position of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist in a single plane by visual observation. Of the four exercises only unilateral shoulder external rotation had a higher normalized error score in the V group of 22.19 (9.30) to 12.64 (6.94) in the P group (P=0.002). For the remaining three exercises the normalized error score did not differ. In conclusion, when instructing simple exercises to reduce musculoskeletal pain the use of video material is a cost‐effective solution that can be implemented easily in corporations with challenging work schedules not allowing for a fixed time of day to go see a personal trainer.

AB: BACKGROUND: Suicide‐related behaviour among young people is of significant concern, yet little is known regarding the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce risk among this population. Of those interventions that have been tested, cognitive‐behavioural therapy appears to show some promise among young people with suicidal ideation. Internet‐based interventions are becoming increasingly popular and have shown some effect in preventing and treating depression and anxiety in young people. However, to date there are no randomised controlled trials examining the impact of Internet‐based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy among suicidal youth. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomised controlled trial testing the effects of Internet‐based cognitive‐behavioural therapy among suicidal high school students who have sought help from the school wellbeing team. The intervention comprises 8 modules of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy delivered online. The study has a staggered, two‐year recruitment phase and participants are assessed at baseline, post intervention and 12 weeks later. DISCUSSION: If effective the program has the ability to be readily adapted and delivered to a range of populations in a range of settings, at relatively little cost. It can also be adapted for mobile applications. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12613000864729. Date registered: 05/08/2013.

AB: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke, predominantly a condition of older age, is a major cause of acquired disability in the global population and puts an increasing burden on health care resources. Clear evidence for the importance of intensity of therapy in optimizing functional outcomes is found in animal models, supported by neuroimaging and behavioral research, and strengthened by recent meta‐analyses from multiple clinical trials. However, providing intensive therapy using conventional treatment paradigms is expensive and sometimes not feasible because of social and environmental factors. This article addresses the need for cost‐effective increased intensity of practice and suggests potential benefits of telehealth (TH) as an innovative model of care in physical therapy. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: We provide an overview of TH and present evidence that a web‐supported program, used in conjunction with constraint‐induced therapy (CIT), can increase intensity and adherence to a rehabilitation regimen. The design and feasibility testing of this web‐based program, "LifeCIT," is presented. We describe how wearable sensors can monitor activity and provide feedback to patients and therapists. The methodology for the development of a wearable device with embedded inertial and mechanomyographic sensors, algorithms to classify functional movement, and a graphical user interface to present meaningful data to patients to support a home exercise program is explained. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: We propose that wearable sensor technologies and TH programs have the potential to provide most‐effective, intensive, home‐based stroke rehabilitation.

AB: Previous studies have found that home‐based intervention programs reduce readmission rates for patients with heart failure. Only one previous trial has compared telephone and videophone to traditional care to deliver a home‐based heart failure intervention program. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a telehealth‐facilitated postdischarge support program in reducing resource use in patients with heart failure. Patients at a Midwestern Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center were randomized to telephone, videophone, or usual care for follow‐up care after hospitalization for heart failure exacerbation. Outcome measures included readmission rates; time to first readmission; urgent care clinic visits; survival; and quality of life. The intervention resulted in a significantly longer time to readmission but had no effect on readmission rates or mortality. There were no differences in hospital days or urgent care clinic use. All subjects reported higher disease‐specific quality of life scores at 1 year. There was evidence of the value of telephone follow‐up, but there was no evidence to support the benefit of videophone care over telephone care. Rigorous evaluation is needed to determine which patients may benefit most from specific telehealth applications and which technologies are most cost‐effective.

AB: BACKGROUND: Telephone‐delivered interventions to provide health counseling for complex chronic medical conditions are convenient, acceptable, and cost‐effective. However, little is known about which patients are reached, their characteristics, and who benefits most from telephone‐delivered counseling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study examined whether baseline characteristics are predictive of being easily reached for a monthly, telephone‐delivered behavioral intervention to improve treatment adherence in Veterans with uncontrolled hypertension. Participants were to complete a telephone session once a month for 6 months. RESULTS: Participants completed an average of 5.71 out of a possible 6 sessions. Participants who were unmarried, African American, unemployed, or younger or did not complete high school required significantly more call attempts per completed session. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, telephone‐delivered counseling is a feasible approach to reaching hypertensive patients. Patients who are married, Hispanic, retired, or older or graduated college may be easier to reach and engage in telephone‐delivered counseling. Reaching patients with other sociodemographic characteristics may require more resources or alternate methods.

AB: BACKGROUND: People with bipolar disorder (BD) experience additional parenting challenges associated with mood driven fluctuations in communication, impulse control and motivation. This paper describes a novel web‐based self‐management approach (Integrated Bipolar Parenting Intervention; IBPI) to support parents with BD. METHOD: Parents with BD with children aged 3‐10 years randomised to IBPI plus treatment as usual (TAU) or waitlist control (WL). IBPI offered 16 weeks access to interactive self‐management information concerning BD and parenting issues. Feasibility was through recruitment, retention and web usage. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 16, 24, 36 and 48 weeks. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN75279027. RESULTS: Ninety seven participants were recruited with 98% retention to end of intervention and 90% to final follow‐up (56%‐94% data analysed of retained participants; higher rates for observer measures). 77% of IBPI participants accessed the website (53% accessed parenting modules). Child behaviour, parenting sense of competence and parenting stress improved significantly in IBPI compared to WL to end of intervention, sustained to 48 weeks. Impacts of IBPI on family functioning, parent mood and time to mood relapse were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Online self‐management support for parents with BD is feasible, with promising improvements in parenting and child behaviour outcomes. A definitive clinical and cost‐effectiveness trial is required to confirm and extend these findings.

AB: Mental disorders and sleep dysfunction are common among Chinese university students. This study aimed to evaluate a low cost scalable mindfulness intervention program to improve psychological health and sleep quality among Chinese university students. A randomized controlled trial with 101 university students (mean age 22.30 ± 2.63, 69.31% female) was conducted. Participants were randomized into 4 groups: Group 1: control group (n = 25), Group 2: mindfulness only group (n = 27), Group 3: mindfulness + plain‐text reminder group (n = 24), and Group 4: mindfulness + enhanced text reminder with animal meme group (n = 25).The mindfulness intervention consisted of two in‐person guided sessions along with weekly self‐guided practice for 7 weeks. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS‐21) and The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to measure depression, anxiety, stress, and sleep dysfunction. After the intervention at week 4, compared to controls, completers in group 2, 3 and 4 (n = 42) showed significantly reduced depression (Cohen's d = 0.83), anxiety (Cohen's d = 0.84), and stress (Cohen's d = 0.75), and improved subjective sleep quality (Cohen's d = 2.00), sleep latency (Cohen's d = 0.55), and habitual sleep efficiency (Cohen's d = 0.86). The effect was maintained at week 7. Low‐intensity mindfulness interventions might be a useful intervention program in university settings.

AB: BackgroundPeople with social anxiety disorder (SAD) fear social interactions and may be reluctant to seek treatments involving exposure to social situations. Social exposure conducted in virtual reality (VR), embedded in individual cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), could be an answer.AimsTo show that conducting VR exposure in CBT for SAD is effective and is more practical for therapists than conducting exposure in vivoMethodParticipants were randomly assigned to either VR exposure (n = 17), in vivo exposure (n = 22) or waiting list (n = 20). Participants in the active arms received individual CBT for 14 weekly sessions and outcome was assessed with questionnaires and a behaviour avoidance test. (Trial registration number ISRCTN99747069)ResultsImprovements were found on the primary (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale) and all five secondary outcome measures in both CBT groups compared with the waiting list. Conducting exposure in VR was more effective at post‐treatment than in vivo on the primary outcome measure and on one secondary measure. Improvements were maintained at the 6‐month follow‐up. VR was significantly more practical for therapists than in vivo exposure.ConclusionsUsing VR can be advantageous over standard CBT as a potential solution for treatment avoidance and as an efficient, cost‐effective and practical medium of exposure.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Telehealth technology may reduce the effect of treatment barriers and improve participation in treatment for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present study is an ongoing randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of prolonged exposure (PE) delivered via in person or home‐based video telehealth modalities. METHOD: A total of 52 veterans with combat‐related PTSD were randomized to receive 8‐12 weeks of PE through either home‐based telehealth or standard in‐person office‐based care. RESULTS: Participants evinced significant reductions in symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety from pre‐ to posttreatment across both conditions. Analyses conducted within a noninferiority framework suggested nonsignificant treatment outcome differences in clinician‐reported PTSD and self‐reported anxiety between the conditions. Results were inconclusive for self‐reported PTSD and depression symptoms. Patient satisfaction ratings did not significantly differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that PE can be delivered via home‐based telehealth with outcomes and satisfaction ratings comparable to in‐person practices for certain symptoms, however additional research is needed. This modality has the potential to address stigma‐ and geographic‐related barriers to treatment, such as travel time and cost.

AB: This study will provide a certain type of exposure therapy, called prolonged exposure therapy (PE), to military Veterans with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). One hundred and seventy‐five Veterans will participate in the study. The main study goal is to compare PE conducted in three different ways: (1) PE that is office‐based (OB; Veterans come to a VA clinic and meet with a therapist via telehealth, using videoconferencing technology), (2) PE delivered via home‐based telehealth (HBT; Veterans stay at home and meet with the therapist via telehealth, using videoconferencing technology), and (3) PE delivered in home, in person (IHIP; the therapist goes to the Veterans' homes to provide the psychotherapy). Symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety will be examined at pre‐treatment, post‐treatment and at six‐month follow up to determine if symptoms change over time. Study hypotheses state that the IHIP approach, compared to the other two approaches, will be more effective at reducing the PTSD symptoms experienced by these Veterans because it will help Veterans attend each session and complete the therapy "homework" assigned by the therapists (such as doing feared, but safe, activities around the house or the neighborhood). However, the delivery of IHIP may cost more than the delivery of PE via the other modalities.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of shared care combined with telecare in type 2 diabetic patients in an underserved community in Asia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In total, 95 patients with type 2 diabetes who had a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of >7% were recruited from six community health centers in remote areas in Changhua County, Taiwan. All patients were randomly divided into intervention (shared care combined with telecare) and usual‐care groups and followed up for 6 months. RESULTS: The decrease in HbA1c level was significantly greater in the intervention group than in the usual‐care group (0.7 ± 1.3% versus 0.1 ± 1.0%, p=0.03). There were no significant differences in lipid profiles and blood pressure changes between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Shared care combined with telecare could significantly reduce HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycemic control in underserved rural communities. Further studies should be conducted to clarify the target users and to develop cost‐effective interventions.

AB: Improving mid‐term and long‐term outcomes after solid organ transplantation is imperative, and requires both state‐of‐the‐art transplant surgery and optimization of routine, evidence‐based aftercare. This randomized, controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of standard aftercare versus telemedically supported case management, an innovative aftercare model, in 46 living‐donor renal transplant recipients during the first posttransplant year. The model includes three components: (i) chronic care case management initiated after discharge, (ii) case management initiated in emerging acute care situations, and (iii) a telemedically equipped team comprising a transplant nurse case manager and two senior transplant physicians (nephrologist, surgeon). Analyses revealed a reduction of unplanned inpatient acute care, with considerable cost reductions, in the intervention group. The prevalence of nonadherence over the 1‐year study period was 17.4% in the intervention group versus 56.5% in the standard aftercare group (p = 0.013). Only the intervention group achieved their pre‐agreed levels of adherence, disease‐specific quality of life, and return to employment. This comparative effectiveness study provides the basis for multicenter study testing of telemedically supported case management with the aim of optimizing posttransplant aftercare. The trial was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (www.DRKS.de), DKRS00007634.

AB: INTRODUCTION: In rural America cigarette smoking is prevalent, few cessation services are available, and healthcare providers lack the time and resources to help smokers quit. This paper describes the design and participant characteristics of Connect2Quit (C2Q), a randomized control trial (RCT) that tests the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of integrated telemedicine counseling delivered by 2‐way webcams mounted on desktop computers in participant's physician office examining rooms (ITM) versus quitline counseling delivered by telephone in participant's homes (Phone) for helping rural smokers quit. METHODS/DESIGN: C2Q was implemented in twenty primary care and safety net clinics. Integrated telemedicine consisted of real‐time video counseling, delivered to patients in their primary care physician's (PCP) office. Phone counseling, was delivered to patients in their homes. All participants received educational materials and guidance in selecting cessation medications. RESULTS: The 566 participants were predominantly Caucasian (92%); 9% were Latino. Most (65%) earned <200% of Federal Poverty Level. One out of three lacked home internet access, 40% were not comfortable using computers, and only 4% had been seen by a doctor via telemedicine in the past. Hypertension, chronic lung disease, and diabetes were highly prevalent. Participants smoked nearly a pack a day and were highly motivated to quit. DISCUSSION: C2Q is reaching a rural low‐income population, with comorbid chronic diseases, that would benefit greatly from quitting smoking. ITM is a good delivery model, which integrates care by holding counseling sessions in the patient's PCP office and keeps the primary care team updated on patients' progress.

AB: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of a system for online glucose monitoring of type 2 diabetes patients. The software automatically filtered the self‐monitored blood glucose data to reduce physicians' time. In the control group, the physicians had to contact the patients manually. We measured the time spent by physicians for online management in a 24‐week study. Seventy‐nine patients were recruited. The frequency of physicians' online monitoring of the patients was decreased by 55% in patients with HbA(1c) ≤ 6.5% and by 29% when HbA(1c) > 6.5% (P < 0.01). Physicians' log‐in time was reduced by 67% and 55% in patients with HbA(1c) ≤6.5% and >6.5%, respectively (P <0.05). HbA(1c) levels were maintained at <6.5% during the study period in both groups. The study showed the efficacy and safety of the software for online communication in diabetes management. The results suggest that it could improve the cost‐effectiveness of online communication systems and form the basis of future clinical applications.

AB: The overall objective of this project is to leverage smartphone‐paired breathalyzers to implement cost‐effective and scalable behavioral interventions to reduce risky drinking behaviors such as drinking and driving. Prospect theory proposes that messages framed in different ways can elicit different responses from individuals. Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains: it's better to not lose $5 than to find $5. People are more motivated to avoid losing something than they are to win something. Studies have found that delivering messaging framed as a loss are also effective in motivating certain behaviors. On the other hand, gain‐framed messages have been shown to have a positive effect on preventative healthcare. By using automated remote monitoring, innovative loss aversion and gain‐framed messaging strategies incorporating insights from behavioral economics could be more easily implemented by delivering effective messaging prior to a risky behavior taking place. The investigators hope that the use of loss aversive and/or gain‐framed messaging will lead to individuals improving planning behavior around drinking, especially in regards to drinking and driving. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a scalable intervention using loss‐ gain‐framed messaging to reduce drinking and driving, compare the effectiveness of each type of messaging, and to increase the use of Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) monitors as a way to plan safer strategies when drinking. The investigators' long‐term objective is to secure federal funding for research that leverages insights from behavioral economics supported by smartphone technology to reduce risky drinking.

AB: Objectives: To assess whether a telephone‐based breastfeeding intervention delivered by lactation educators influenced exclusive breastfeeding rates among low‐income Hispanic women in the USA. Design: Randomised two‐group design. Setting: Pregnant low‐income Hispanic women (298) were recruited from community health clinics in Los Angeles County (USA) and randomly assigned to either a control or an intervention group. Methods: Data relating to the factors associated with breastfeeding were collected during the third trimester. Breastfeeding outcome data were collected at 72 hours, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months postpartum. Results: There were no differences between the groups in rates of breastfeeding initiation. There was a significant difference in the duration of exclusive breastfeeding among participants during the infants first week of life. While not significant, after controlling for covariates and intent to breastfeed at third trimester, the duration of exclusive breastfeeding among all participants was, on average, longer for intervention group mothers than control group mothers. Additionally, the intervention group mothers were more likely to report exclusive and only breastfeeding at all data points compared to the control group and less likely to discontinue breastfeeding. Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that telephone‐based breastfeeding interventions delivered by a lactation educator show promise as a cost‐effective strategy for improving both the quantity and the duration of breastfeeding among low‐income Hispanic women in the USA. Intervention group mothers not only sustained breastfeeding for a longer durations but also provided their infants with greater amounts of breast milk over these longer durations.

AB: This project aims to determine if a smartphone‐delivered cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program could show similar clinical outcomes to in‐person programs at a low cost in a large population of patients. Investigators will also assess the feasibility of tailoring a virtual CR program to a small sample of COPD participants who also stand to benefit in the absence of an established pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program. This is a randomized controlled clinical trial of participants at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center with an applicable diagnosis for cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation versus usual care during the study period. The study team plans to simultaneously recruit two cohorts of participants referred for CR (Cohort A) and PR (Cohort B) to take part in an in‐home, virtual rehabilitation program. To compare this intervention to traditional CR, investigators will perform an observational cohort study of patients who are already enrolled through the CHOICE program in conventional CR. Furthermore, to better understand the potential impact of this intervention, investigators will perform a retrospective chart review of patients referred for CR over the past 5‐years. Investigators seek to address the following: 1. Determine whether a home‐based cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation program delivered through smartphones is feasible and improves functional status. 2. Determine if education and lifestyle counseling lead to increased adherence with prescribed follow‐up, pharmacotherapy, quality of life, self‐efficacy and lifestyle changes. 3. Determine if a home‐based cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation program reduces health system utilization, including ED visits and readmission rates.

AB: BACKGROUND: Most outpatient orthopedic follow‐up visits for patients who had total joint arthroplasty are routine among those with well‐functioning implants. The technology and resources now exist to enable patient assessment without requiring attendance in hospital. We tested an electronic clinic for routine follow‐up in a small cohort of arthroplasty patients. METHODS: We randomly assigned primary arthroplasty patients scheduled for routine annual outpatient review into 2 groups: group A completed a Web‐based assessment 4 weeks after the clinical assessment, whereas group B completed the Web‐based assessment first. Standard clinical questionnaires were included. We also collected radiographic data and information on assessment duration and cost. RESULTS: Forty patients participated in the study. The average age of participants was 58 years. There were 12 men and 8 women in each of the 2 groups. The average total time spent by patients on an outpatient visit was 115 minutes, compared with 52 minutes for the electronic assessment. Participants reported the electronic assessment to be more convenient and less costly. CONCLUSION: This pilot study supports the practical use of an electronic clinic for the follow‐up of arthroplasty patients. Further studies examining the complex interaction of factors involved in patient clinics are needed.

AB: Background: Suicide‐related behaviour among young people is of significant concern, yet little is known regarding the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce risk among this population. Of those interventions that have been tested, cognitive‐behavioural therapy appears to show some promise among young people with suicidal ideation. Internet‐based interventions are becoming increasingly popular and have shown some effect in preventing and treating depression and anxiety in young people. However, to date there are no randomised controlled trials examining the impact of Internet‐based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy among suicidal youth.Methods/design: This is a randomised controlled trial testing the effects of Internet‐based cognitive‐behavioural therapy among suicidal high school students who have sought help from the school wellbeing team. The intervention comprises 8 modules of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy delivered online. The study has a staggered, two‐year recruitment phase and participants are assessed at baseline, post intervention and 12 weeks later.Discussion: If effective the program has the ability to be readily adapted and delivered to a range of populations in a range of settings, at relatively little cost. It can also be adapted for mobile applications.Trial registration: ACTRN12613000864729. Date registered: 05/08/2013. 2014 Robinson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB: Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and re‐lapsing gastrointestinal disorder that requires continuous and per‐sonalized follow‐up to achieve long remission and minimize short and long‐term damage. Telemedicine has been successfully used to provide healthcare services remotely with the implementation of information and communication technologies in IBD patients. Aims: To develop a platform web, TECCU (Telemonitorización en Enfer‐medad de Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa), for a remote control of complex IBD patients (moderate‐severe activity) and compare disease activity over 24 weeks in a clinical trial of IBD patients who received standard care (Control‐G) vs nursing care by telephone (NT‐G) vs intervention based on distance monitoring TECCU‐G). Secondarily, to assess health‐related quality of life, adverse events, therapeutic adherence and the impact on direct health care costs. Methods: We describe the development of a remote monitoring system and the difficulties encountered in the platform design. Moreover, a three‐arm randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this web platform in decreasing disease activ‐ity compared to NT‐G and Control‐G [Image Presented] Inclusion criteria: IBD patients diagnosed according to internation‐ally criteria; >be 18 years; CD or UC patients with moderate or severe activity attending in the IBD unit during the inclusion period; Patients starting medical treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive or biological agents. Results: Patients from each group, according to schedules established in relation to the started treatment, answer periodic questionnaires regarding disease activity, quality of life, treatment adher‐ence, side effects, satisfaction, work productivity and social activities. Blood and stool (fecal calprotectin) analysis is performed periodically. Based on the results of these tests in G‐TECCU, alerts are generated in a platform web, with adapted action plans including changes in medication and following‐up frequency. Similarly, in the telephone and usual care groups these interventions are developed by telephone and clinical visits, respectively. Conclusions: The development of a remote management program of IBD patients via web (TECCU) can be a challenge for achieving adequate and safe control of the disease from a distance. The results of this clinical trial could show the efficacy of a web‐based telemonitor‐ing system to improve disease activity, quality of life and to decrease health care using in complex IBD patients.

AB: Introduction: Untreated Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) can lead to high morbidity, such as reduced cognitive function and increased risk of accidents, and it is associated with diseases such as systemic arterial hypertension, metabolic syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. Multimorbidity implies to change organization of care and follow‐up. Objective: We prospectively assessed adherence using daily telemonitoring of naïve Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) OSA patients data and other associated clinical parameters of cardio‐metabolic risk during six months. The ultimate goal of this pilot trial will be to develop an effective, extensible and cost‐effective system to promote improved adherence to CPAP patients, as well as monitor clinical parameters (HR, hypertension, glycaemia, and oximetry) of frequently associated OSA co‐morbidities. Materials and methods: In a single center, 33 naïve PAP adult patients with moderate to severe OSA were randomized in two groups: standard care consisting in first week and weekly, if necessary, first, third and sixth month consultations and those with daily telemonitoring information (i.e., adherence, air leak, residual AHI) plus standard care. If problems were identified from information from the website, the patientwas contacted by telephone and eventually by a consultation of a homecare technician. Subjects who used PAP for at least 6 hours per night for at least 90% of the days monitored were regarded as adherent. We also analyzed the correlation between adherence and cardio‐metabolic clinical parameters. Results: 32 patients were enrolled, 16 were randomized to telemedicine and 17 to standard care. The mean age was 56, 2 yr., mean AHI was 39, 4 events/hr., and 57% of patients were male. Only after 1 month, mean PAP adherence was significantly greater in the telemedicine arm versus the standard arm. After 3 mo. PAP adherence in the telemedicine arm was almost total sleep time (7h34) versus 5h58 in the standard arm. But after 6 months, there was no difference between the two groups. Additionally, we analyzed cardio‐metabolic clinical parameters with PAP adherence and independent predictors of PAP adherence. Conclusions: Early PAP adherence can be improved with the use of a webbased telemedicine system at the beginning of the treatment. Standard Care implied much more resources and time‐consuming. This trial demonstrates that good PAP adherence occurs during the first few days and was predicted by the correction of the interface problems in the first two weeks of treatment, greater AHI, severity as measured by both AHI and TC90, greater Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, greater Body Mass Index (BMI) and by the presence of comorbidities as hypertension and diabetes at baseline. Cardio‐metabolic diseases and inherent clinical parameters significantly improved with total sleep time PAP adherence associated with body mass control and an exercise regular program.

DOI: 10.1186/s12890-016-0288-z
AB: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an effective intervention for the management of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, available resources are often limited, and many patients bear with poor availability of programmes. Sustaining PR benefits and regular exercise over the long term is difficult without any exercise maintenance strategy. In contrast to traditional centre‐based PR programmes, telerehabilitation may promote more effective integration of exercise routines into daily life over the longer term and broaden its applicability and availability. A few studies showed promising results for telerehabilitation, but mostly with short‐term interventions. The aim of this study is to compare long‐term telerehabilitation with unsupervised exercise training at home and with standard care. METHODS/DESIGN: An international multicentre randomised controlled trial conducted across sites in three countries will recruit 120 patients with COPD. Participants will be randomly assigned to telerehabilitation, treadmill and control, and followed up for 2 years. The telerehabilitation intervention consists of individualised exercise training at home on a treadmill, telemonitoring by a physiotherapist via videoconferencing using a tablet computer, and self‐management via a customised website. Patients in the treadmill arm are provided with a treadmill only to perform unsupervised exercise training at home. Patients in the control arm are offered standard care. The primary outcome is the combined number of hospitalisations and emergency department presentations. Secondary outcomes include changes in health status, quality of life, anxiety and depression, self‐efficacy, subjective impression of change, physical performance, level of physical activity, and personal experiences in telerehabilitation. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide evidence on whether long‐term telerehabilitation represents a cost‐effective strategy for the follow‐up of patients with COPD. The delivery of telerehabilitation services will also broaden the availability of PR and maintenance strategies, especially to those living in remote areas and with no access to centre‐based exercise programmes.

AB: BACKGROUND: Telemonitoring of symptoms and physiological signs has been suggested as a means of early detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, with a view to instituting timely treatment. However, algorithms to identify exacerbations result in frequent false‐positive results and increased workload. Machine learning, when applied to predictive modelling, can determine patterns of risk factors useful for improving prediction quality. OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to (1) establish whether machine learning techniques applied to telemonitoring datasets improve prediction of hospital admissions and decisions to start corticosteroids, and (2) determine whether the addition of weather data further improves such predictions. METHODS: We used daily symptoms, physiological measures, and medication data, with baseline demography, COPD severity, quality of life, and hospital admissions from a pilot and large randomized controlled trial of telemonitoring in COPD. We linked weather data from the United Kingdom meteorological service. We used feature selection and extraction techniques for time series to construct up to 153 predictive patterns (features) from symptom, medication, and physiological measurements. We used the resulting variables to construct predictive models fitted to training sets of patients and compared them with common symptom‐counting algorithms. RESULTS: We had a mean 363 days of telemonitoring data from 135 patients. The two most practical traditional score‐counting algorithms, restricted to cases with complete data, resulted in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) estimates of 0.60 (95% CI 0.51‐0.69) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.50‐0.67) for predicting admissions based on a single day's readings. However, in a real‐world scenario allowing for missing data, with greater numbers of patient daily data and hospitalizations (N=57,150, N+=55, respectively), the performance of all the traditional algorithms fell, including those based on 2 days' data. One of the most frequently used algorithms performed no better than chance. All considered machine learning models demonstrated significant improvements; the best machine learning algorithm based on 57,150 episodes resulted in an aggregated AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.67‐0.80). Adding weather data measurements did not improve the predictive performance of the best model (AUC 0.74, 95% CI 0.69‐0.79). To achieve an 80% true‐positive rate (sensitivity), the traditional algorithms were associated with an 80% false‐positive rate: our algorithm halved this rate to approximately 40% (specificity approximately 60%). The machine learning algorithm was moderately superior to the best symptom‐counting algorithm (AUC 0.77, 95% CI 0.74‐0.79 vs AUC 0.66, 95% CI 0.63‐0.68) at predicting the need for corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection and management of COPD remains an important goal given its huge personal and economic costs. Machine learning approaches, which can be tailored to an individual's baseline profile and can learn from experience of the individual patient, are superior to existing predictive algorithms and show promise in achieving this goal.

AB: Although the efficacy and effectiveness of lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive pharmaceutical treatment for the prevention and control of hypertension and concomitant cardiovascular disease have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, this scientific knowledge has not been fully applied in the general population, especially in low‐income communities. This article summarizes interventions to improve hypertension management and describes the rationale and study design for a cluster randomized trial testing whether a comprehensive intervention program within a national public primary care system will improve hypertension control among uninsured hypertensive men and women and their families. We will recruit 1,890 adults from 18 clinics within a public primary care network in Argentina. Clinic patients with uncontrolled hypertension, their spouses and hypertensive family members will be enrolled. The comprehensive intervention program targets the primary care system through health care provider education, a home‐based intervention among patients and their families (home delivery of antihypertensive medication, self‐monitoring of blood pressure [BP], health education for medication adherence and lifestyle modification) conducted by community health workers and a mobile health intervention. The primary outcome is net change in systolic BP from baseline to month 18 between intervention and control groups among hypertensive study participants. The secondary outcomes are net change in diastolic BP, BP control and cost‐effectiveness of the intervention. This study will generate urgently needed data on effective, practical and sustainable intervention programs aimed at controlling hypertension and concomitant cardiovascular disease in underserved populations in low‐ and middle‐income countries.

AB: Anticipated Impact on Veterans' Healthcare: This project addresses the mental health and functioning needs of Veterans and their families by increasing the access to an established treatment using telemental health technology. Project Background: Veterans and their families experience the deleterious effects of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated negative sequelae. PTSD is related to a variety of comorbid mental health symptomatology and psychosocial impairment, including high rates of intimate relationship problems which impact Veterans' recovery and functioning. Despite available couple‐based interventions, barriers to care such as stigma regarding mental health treatment, travel time to receive care, and transportation costs, make it difficult for Veterans and their families to access specialty PTSD treatments necessary for rehabilitation. Home‐based clinical video teleconferencing (CVT) delivers specialized mental health treatments to clients in the ease of their own home, which allows clinicians to directly observe the client's home environment and family milieu. Cognitive‐Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT), a couple‐based treatment designed to target PTSD symptoms and improve individual and relationship functioning, has shown evidence of improvements in clinical symptom outcomes in research conducted with Veterans and their partners. Project Objectives: This is a 4‐year randomized controlled trial. The primary objective of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy (PTSD symptoms, relationship distress, and functional impairment) of CBCT delivered via an office‐based (CBCT‐OB) or a home‐based CVT (CBCT‐HB) delivery modality to the PTSD Family Education control condition (PFE). In addition, this study will estimate and compare the difference in clinical efficacy between CBCT delivered via an office‐based (CBCT‐OB) or a home‐based CVT (CBCT‐HB) delivery modality if indicated by results of the primary objective. This study will also compare process outcomes (therapeutic alliance, enrollment and dropout rates, and treatment satisfaction) for CBCT‐OB, CBCT‐HB, and PFE. Project Methods: Participants will be 180 intent‐to‐treat couples in which one partner is a PTSD‐positive Veteran. Couples will be randomly assigned to receive treatment through one of the three treatment delivery modalities: CBCT‐OB, CBCT‐HB or PFE. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, mid‐ and post‐treatment, and 3‐ and 6‐months post‐treatment. The primary outcome variables of clinical efficacy will be measures of PTSD symptom severity, relationship distress and functional impairment. Secondary process outcomes will include measures of treatment retention, attendance, therapeutic alliance, and treatment satisfaction. The results will provide evidence that can be used to further increase the clinical efficacy, ease of access to, and utilization of specialty PTSD treatment to Veterans and their families.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of home based telehealth interventions on the use of secondary healthcare and mortality. DESIGN: Pragmatic, multisite, cluster randomised trial comparing telehealth with usual care, using data from routine administrative datasets. General practice was the unit of randomisation. We allocated practices using a minimisation algorithm, and did analyses by intention to treat. SETTING : 179 general practices in three areas in England. PARTICIPANTS : 3230 people with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or heart failure recruited from practices between May 2008 and November 2009. INTERVENTIONS: Telehealth involved remote exchange of data between patients and healthcare professionals as part of patients' diagnosis and management. Usual care reflected the range of services available in the trial sites, excluding telehealth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of patients admitted to hospital during 12 month trial period. RESULTS: Patient characteristics were similar at baseline. Compared with controls, the intervention group had a lower admission proportion within 12 month follow‐up (odds ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 0.97, P = 0.017). Mortality at 12 months was also lower for intervention patients than for controls (4.6% v 8.3%; odds ratio 0.54, 0.39 to 0.75, P < 0.001). These differences in admissions and mortality remained significant after adjustment. The mean number of emergency admissions per head also differed between groups (crude rates, intervention 0.54 v control 0.68); these changes were significant in unadjusted comparisons (incidence rate ratio 0.81, 0.65 to 1.00, P = 0.046) and after adjusting for a predictive risk score, but not after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Length of hospital stay was shorter for intervention patients than for controls (mean bed days per head 4.87 v 5.68; geometric mean difference ‐0.64 days, ‐1.14 to ‐0.10, P = 0.023, which remained significant after adjustment). Observed differences in other forms of hospital use, including notional costs, were not significant in general. Differences in emergency admissions were greatest at the beginning of the trial, during which we observed a particularly large increase for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth is associated with lower mortality and emergency admission rates. The reasons for the short term increases in admissions for the control group are not clear, but the trial recruitment processes could have had an effect.

AB: BACKGROUND: The prevalence of depression is high and results in huge costs for society. Internet‐based cognitive behavioural treatment (ICBT) has been suggested for use in primary care and has been shown to be more effective when combined with human support. However, non‐completion rates remain a challenge. Current recommendations state that steps to improve persistence with ICBT should be determined and the impact of therapist support on persistence explored. A few earlier studies have explored motivations to persist with ICBT without face‐to‐face therapist support. The present study explored the motivation to persist as experienced by a group of patients who sought help in primary care and used "blended care", i.e. ICBT supported by short face‐to‐face consultations. METHODS: To elucidate motivation in an everyday context and the meaning of patients' experiences we chose a phenomenological hermeneutical approach. We interviewed participants in the intervention group of a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of an ICBT programme called MoodGYM, an eHealth intervention used to treat depression. Fourteen participants, both completers and non‐completers, went through individual, semi‐structured interviews after they ended their treatment. RESULTS: Hope of recovery and a desire to gain control of one's life were identified as intrinsic motivators. The feeling of being able to freely choose how, when and where to complete the ICBT modules was identified as an important supporting condition and satisfied the participants' need for autonomy. Furthermore, the importance of a sense of belonging towards partners, friends or family was essential for motivation as was the ability to identify with ICBT content. Another supporting condition was the experience of connectedness when met with acknowledgement, flexibility and feedback from a qualified therapist in the face‐to‐face consultations. CONCLUSIONS: A key finding was that participants were motivated to persist with ICBT when their overall need for relatedness was satisfied. This was achieved through a sense of belonging towards partners, friends and family. Connectedness with the therapist and the participant's ability to identify with the ICBT modules also gave a sense of relatedness. Improving these motivational aspects may increase patients' persistence with ICBT.

AB: PCIT is an evidence‐based behavioral intervention for children exhibiting emotional and behavioral disorders (Brinkmeyer & Eyberg, 2003). PCIT has been found to have several profound short‐and long‐term effects for families who graduate from treatment. However, attrition rates for PCIT have ranged from 32 to 56%. Children who prematurely drop out of treatment continue to demonstrate significant problems over time. Another particular difficulty of behavioral parent training programs is generalization of skills to natural environments. That is, PCIT therapists find that families may not practice the learned parenting skills outside of session in the manner that they were intended. Parents may also have difficulties using the skills effectively during real interactions with their child in their natural environment versus a simulated interaction during actual therapy sessions. While PCIT Therapists provide parents with handouts that explain skills in more detail, parents often misplace handouts given to them. Further, the extent that written materials match a parents' learning style may also dictate rate of CDI and PDI concept and skill acquisition. These treatment limitations may impact the rate at which families complete treatment and ultimately the number of families who can receive PCIT. As such, mechanisms for increasing family engagement in therapy and retention into services are needed to improve the overall long‐term functioning of families. To help increase family engagement in therapy and retention into services, UM PCIT and UM TeleHealth is developing a mobile PCIT app. This mobile app will provide families with constant access to support and resources outside of therapy sessions. Specifically, this app will provide parents with a multimedia resource that includes video and audio demonstrations and examples of skills and treatment strategies (e.g. video examples of using PRIDE skills during special time and in natural environments, how to use time‐out in public places, etc.). The aim of the study is to determine if usage of a PCIT app during therapy increases the efficiency of treatment and allows families to graduate in fewer sessions relative to traditional PCIT. Specifically, families will be randomly assigned to receive traditional PCIT services or receive PCIT plus mobile app services. Results will be measured by examining the number of sessions needed to reach CDI and PDI mastery and treatment completion with the mobile app compared to traditional PCIT. Further, it is expected that there will less attrition in the PCIT plus mobile app group as families will have access to more resources to learn and understand PCIT skills. Gaining insight on the ability of a PCIT app to improve treatment efficiency may not only help more children who exhibit emotional and behavioral disorders, and strengthen the quality of parent‐child interactions, but also result in significant healthcare savings, as shorter treatment length means less costs associated with therapist time, family transportation, space, materials, and equipment.

AB: IMPORTANCE: Teleophthalmology has the potential to reduce costs and inconveniences associated with frequent patient visits. Evaluating teleophthalmology in the management of age‐related macular degeneration (AMD) will allow for future implementation of this technology. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate teleophthalmology as a tool for the screening and monitoring of neovascular AMD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective, randomized clinical trial that included 106 referral eyes for suspected neovascular AMD and 63 eyes with stable neovascular AMD. New referrals for patients with suspected neovascular AMD and patients with stable neovascular AMD were randomized into either routine or teleophthalmologic groups. In the routine group, patients received clinical assessment and diagnostic imaging at a tertiary hospital‐based retina clinic. In the teleophthalmologic group, patients received basic examination and diagnostic imaging at a stand‐alone teleophthalmologic site, where patient information and imaging studies were acquired and electronically sent over to tertiary hospital‐based retina specialists. Patients in the teleophthalmologic group were called back to the tertiary treatment center if the teleophthalmologic data set suggested pathology or was inconclusive for diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient wait times for diagnosis and/or treatment, referral accuracy, and visual outcome. RESULTS: For neovascular AMD screening, the average referral‐to‐diagnostic imaging time was 22.5 days for the teleophthalmologic group and 18.0 days for the routine group, for a difference of 4.5 days (95%CI, 11.8 to ‐2.8 days; P = .23). The average diagnostic imaging to treatment time was 16.4 days for the teleophthalmologic group and 11.6 days for the routine group, for a difference of 4.8 days (95%CI, 10.7 to ‐1.1 days; P = .11). For neovascular AMD monitoring, the average recurrence to treatment time was shorter for the routine group (0.04 days) compared with 13.6 days for the teleophthalmologic group, for a difference of ‐13.5 days (95%CI, ‐18.2 to ‐9.0days; P < .01). There was no difference identified between end‐of‐study visual acuities in the 2 groups (P = .99). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A delay of referral to treatment time could not be identified when comparing teleophthalmologic screening for suspected neovascular AMD with retinal specialist‐based screening. Teleophthalmologic monitoring for neovascular AMD recurrence resulted in longer wait times for treatment reinitiation, but no adverse visual outcomes were identified.

KY: Lung Diseases; Lung Diseases, Obstructive; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive
AB: Rationale: Application of long‐term non‐invasive ventilation (NIV) in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (CHRF) has recently been shown to improve survival and quality of life when applied with sufficiently high inspiratory pressures and adequate backup breathing frequencies (so called high‐intensity NIV). However, for a broader implementation of this therapy in a potentially large group of patients, important issues have to be solved. First, the initiation of high‐intensity NIV, currently performed in the hospital, is often time‐consuming, expensive and inconvenient for patients. Secondly, although clinicians recognise that not all patients benefit, it is not known which factors predict a positive response. Objectives: 1. To investigate whether home initiation of chronic NIV in stable COPD patients with CHRF is non‐inferior to inpatient initiation. 2. To investigate predictors of a favourable response to chronic NIV in COPD patients with CHRF. Study design: The study is 1:1 two‐arm parallel group randomised controlled trial comparing the usual inpatient NIV initiation to home initiation. Study population: Seventy‐two COPD patients with a NIV indication (COPD GOLD stage III or IV; partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) > 6.0 kPa in stable condition, i.e. no COPD exacerbation for 4 weeks and a pH > 7.35), a sufficient social network at home, without severe cardiac comorbidities, will be included. Intervention: Home initiation of NIV will be compared with standard in‐hospital initiation. NIV at home will be titrated by a specialised nurse of our home mechanical ventilation centre (HMV) on transcutaneously measured gas exchange and respiratory electromyography and will be adjusted with the use of telemedicine. Main study parameters/endpoints: 1. To investigate non‐inferiority of home initiation, the change in arterial carbon dioxide pressure after 3 months treatment will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are safety, change in lung function, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and costs. 2. To investigate predictors of a favourable response, patient demographics, and baseline data on lung function as well as measures of respiratory muscle activity, arterial blood gases, comorbidities, inflammatory blood markers and anxiety and depressions scores will be collected of all patients.

AB: INTERVENTION: Intervention group: Mobile application (App) After randomization patients will receive access to the App‐ URinControl. In the App, basic information is provided in a video fragment. Next, participants will be guided for type of UI and starting level of exercises and start with a tailored training program. Women with stress (predominant) UI will start with pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT); women with urgency (predominant) UI will start with bladder training and PFMT will be added later in the program. All exercises will be supported by audio fragments. All information will be available through a bibliography within the app. During the program patients are asked to fill out the number of incontinence episodes, as well as the intensity with which they performed the exercises. Treatment will be reinforced by regularly sending 'push' notifications to stimulate treatment adherence. The content of the app is a translation of the recommendations of the guidelines on the treatment of UI of women in primary care. If the progress of the treatment is unsatisfactory participants are advised to contact their general practitioner (GP). Control group: Standard Care Patients in the standard care group will be diagnosed and treated according to NHG‐guideline on UI (PFMT in case of stress UI, bladder training for urgency UI). GP’s can instruct patients themselves, or refer them to a practice nurse or a specialized pelvic physiotherapist.

AB: Rationale: Psychogenic non‐epileptic seizures (PNES) are typically diagnosed in long‐term video EEG monitoring (LTVM) units. The practice of delivering the diagnosis and arranging follow‐up for PNES varies among LTVM units and no standard treatment approach exists. The contribution of an inpatient psychiatry consultation also varies across centers, and patients who do not understand their diagnosis often return to emergency departments or seek second opinions, incurring high healthcare costs. We compared event frequency and behavioral outcomes following three different treatment approaches with the goal of identifying the best treatment option and developing a standardized approach to PNES following diagnosis. Methods: Patients admitted to the LTVM unit for diagnostic evaluation of spells of unclear etiology at Emory University Hospital from July 2011 to May 2012 were consented for the study. All subjects completed a baseline questionnaire as well as the Beck Depression Index (BDI) and Quality of Life in Epilepsy‐10 (QOLIE‐ 10) scale. Patients diagnosed with PNES by video EEG were randomized to one of three treatment groups: Group A received an unscripted diagnosis delivered by the epilepsy attending and no further management; Group B received a scripted discussion of the diagnosis, a formal psychiatry consultation, and an educational handout; and Group C underwent the same treatment as Group B but also received weekly phone follow‐up. All groups were called at 8 weeks to determine event frequency, BDI and QOLIE‐10 score. Results: A total of 75 patients were consented for the study of which 30 were randomized and completed follow‐up with the following distribution: Group A= 10, Group B=9, Group C=11. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics among the groups (Table 1). There was a significant decrease in event frequency at 8 week follow‐up for patients in Group B and C (p=0.011, 0.004, respectively) (Table 2). QOLIE 10 scores improved in all patient groups, particularly in group B and C (p= 0.05, 0.001, 0.001). Patients in Group B and C also endorsed fewer social and work limitations and were less afraid of having further events. There was a significant decline in BDI score seen in group C only (p=0.004). Although not statistically significant, Group C was also more likely to seek follow‐up from a mental health provider and believe their events would stop, while they were less likely to seek a second opinion. Conclusions: A defined PNES treatment strategy that includes inpatient psychiatry consultation, scripted discussion of the diagnosis, and weekly phone contact may impact event frequency, quality of life, depression, and appropriate healthcare utilization. Further studies evaluating PNES treatment algorithms are warranted. (Table Presented).

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03635151
YR: 2018
AB: Stroke is a leading cause of serious, long‐term disability, and has a very sudden onset; families are often thrust into providing care without any training from health care providers. Studies have shown that caregiving without training can be detrimental to caregiver's physical and mental health, which can impede survivor rehabilitation and lead to institutionalization and higher societal costs. Unlike existing stroke caregiver interventions that require costly face to face interactions, and that focus primarily on the survivor's care, the Telephone Assessment and Skill‐Building Kit (TASK II) is delivered completely by telephone, and empowers caregivers to address both their own and the survivor's needs using innovative skill‐building strategies. Aligned with current patient and caregiver guidelines, TASK II has demonstrated evidence of content validity, treatment fidelity, caregiver satisfaction, and efficacy for reducing depressive symptoms; however, future development of TASK II requires a stronger focus on self‐management strategies to improve caregiver health, and enhanced use of other telehealth modes of delivery prior to implementation into ongoing stroke systems of care. The purpose of this study is to optimize the TASK III intervention through the innovative leveraging of technologies and theoretically‐based self‐management strategies to improve caregiver health. Specific Aim 1 consists of focus groups and individual interviews with 40 experts (10 interdisciplinary researchers, 10 technology experts, 10 clinicians and clinical leaders, and 10 stroke family caregivers) to provide preferences about essential areas of new self‐management content, proposed technologies (e.g., iBook, eBook, interactive website, FaceTime, Zoom), and future implementation strategies to inform a novel TASK III prototype. Specific Aim 2 will determine feasibility of the TASK III intervention with a pilot study of 74 stroke caregivers randomized to TASK III or an Information, Support, and Referral (ISR) group in preparation for a larger randomized controlled clinical trial. Recruitment, retention, treatment fidelity, satisfaction, and technology ratings will be obtained for both TASK III and ISR groups who will receive 8 weekly sessions with a booster session 4 weeks later. Outcome measures will be explored at baseline, 8 weeks (end of intervention), and 12 weeks (after booster). If TASK III is shown to be efficacious in a future randomized controlled clinical trial, our next goal will be to translate TASK III into ongoing stroke systems of care; and, someday to adapt it for use among caregivers with other debilitating/chronic conditions providing a tremendous public health impact.

AB: Background: Healthcare costs have grown at unsustainable rates. Avoiding low value hospitalizations from the ED through clinical pathways, decision support tools, observation care and coordination of services are potential strategies but there may be important rural‐urban differences to consider. Methods: A cross‐sectional web‐based survey was emailed to medical directors and/or nurse managers of the 135 hospital‐based EDs in Michigan. Questions included presence of clinical pathways, factors influencing admission decisions, standardized services aimed at reducing avoidable admissions and barriers in connecting patients to outpatient services. We determined if EDs were located in rural/micropolitan or urban counties based on the U.S. Office of Management and Budget definitions. Descriptive statistics and chi‐square were used for the analysis. Results: Responses were received from 64 (49%) of the 131 EDs reached. EDs were well distributed throughout the state, 36 in urban counties and 28 in rural/micropolitan counties. Clinical pathways to facilitate discharge or avoid admission were reported at 31 sites and more likely in urban than rural EDs (58% vs. 36%). Three quarters of both urban and rural EDs reported presence of programs to connect patients to outpatient resources and avoid admission. Of these, home health services and wound care were more commonly reported by rural than urban EDs (46% vs. 41% and 50% vs. 31%, p < 0.001) and observation units were less common (39% vs. 47%, p < 0.001). Rapid PCP and specialist follow‐up, ED follow‐up clinics and telemedicine programs were infrequent. Urban EDs reported greater influence of PCPs and specialists on admission decision (50% vs. 41% and 53% vs. 27%, p < 0.001). Few sites utilized social workers, care managers, physical therapy and ED‐based pharmacy regardless of urban/rural setting. Barriers to connecting ED patients to outpatient services were reported lower for rural than urban settings, including lack of family support (74% vs. 83%), timely PCP follow‐up (65% vs. 80%), timely specialist follow‐up (83% vs. 87%), and support for discharge planning (65% vs. 83%) (p < 0.001 for each comparison). Conclusion: Rural‐urban differences in ED resources and barriers demonstrate unique challenges necessitating a tailored approach to reducing avoidable hospitalizations.

AB: INTERVENTION: In addition to routine care, the patients receive the following interventions that are not included in routine care: Case management: This takes place over two years and involves continuous organization of KTX related health care by a case manager. Psychosocial assessments: These take place twice yearly over two years and involve assessment of adherence in personal interviews using the Basel Assessment of Adherence with Immunosuppressive Medication Scale (BAASIS©). A collaborative rather than confrontational interview style will be used in order to elicit honest replies and to avoid social desirability. We will assess the following potential barriers of adherence using established instruments: cognitive dysfunctions, lack of resources, lack of knowledge regarding IS, experience of adverse events, mental disorders, psychological distress, low quality of life, and low social support. Psychococial intervention: Patients in need of more information about IS will be referred to an educational group offered by the case manager. Patients can also be referred to a psychologist within the psychosocial team who will offer up to eight treatment sessions per year without waiting period. This intervention can be conducted face‐to‐face or over the internet and will deal with psychosocial correlates of non‐adherence (e.g., social or work problems, psychological distress) and offer behavioral interventions. Cardiovascular assessment: This takes place twice yearly over two years and involves a physical examination and an incremental exercise testing on an ergometer including blood lactate measurements for determination of cardiovascular and skeletal muscle function. Furthermore a 30 minute constant load test on a cycle ergometer with ECG, blood pressure, blood lactate and glucose monitoring, a Timed up and go test, a Sit‐to‐Stand‐test and measurement of steps per day will be performed initially and every 6 months for evaluation of second outcome parameters. Training pr CONDITION: Kidney transplantation ; Surgery ; Kidney transplantation PRIMARY OUTCOME: Health care costs due to hospitalization are measured using health insurance data at end of all interventions (12 or 24 months). SECONDARY OUTCOME: In all patients all endpoints will be evaluated 24 months after study start, taking into account that some patients will only have 12 months of interventions.; ; 1. Adherence for outpatient visits is measured by actual visits/scheduled visits at end of all interventions; 2. Adherence to immunosuppressive therapy is measured by BAASIS‐Scale at each psychosocial assessment; 3. Cardiovascular fitness and stabilization of weight is measured by different parameters at each CV‐assessment; 4. Quality of life is measured by Peds‐QL and/or SF35 at each psychosocial assessment; 5. Implementation of an internet‐based case file including all sectors of care is assessed using case file at end of all interventions; 6. Implementation and acceptance of telemedicine visits are measured using case file at end of all interventions INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients receiving a kidney transplant between 2010 and 2019 in lower Saxoney.

AB: Background: Previous published studies on home telemetry have suggested inconsistent results and current published systematic reviews have not included recent trials leading to indeterminate conclusions. This meta‐analysis aims to assess the utility of home telemonitoring strategies on disease management and clinical outcome in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (chronic CHF). Methods: A search in Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1995 to Nov 2016) was performed and identified 14 randomized controlled studies (RCT's) designed to evaluate the effect of home telemonitoring on the management and clinical outcome of patients with chronic HF (Table 1). For the clinical endpoints of All‐ Cause Mortality (primary objective) and Hospital Readmission for HF (secondary objective), we calculated Risk Ratios with 95% confidence intervals using Mantel‐Haenszel Random Effects model. The degree of heterogeneity was evaluated by the I2 index. Publication bias assessed using Funnel plots. Results: In total, 4410 patients were randomized for primary outcome, of whom 2,150 were allocated to home telemonitoring (HTM) and 2,260 patients to control. The time of follow‐up ranged from 3 months to 1 year. Pooled analysis of primary objective across 9 RCT's showed that there was 20% mortality benefit which was statistically significant in Telemonitoring group (MH‐RR=.80, 95% CI: 0.67‐0.97, p<0.02; Figure 1) as compared to control. Analysis based on secondary objective among 11 RCT's showed that there was 13% benefit in HF hospitalization but was not statistically significant in Telemonitoring group (MH‐RR=.87, 95% CI: 0.73‐0.1.03, p=0.11; Figure 2) as compared to control. Conclusion: Home telemonitoring has lost favor as a promising noninvasive strategy to intensify and improve HF management in the outpatient setting. However, its role may be under utilized in the patientcentered home with potential to reduce all‐cause mortality. Furthermore, albeit statistically insignificant, there was a reduction in hospitalization for HF. Future studies should evaluate this potential in more detail and reveal if this strategy is cost‐effective in reducing the health and economic burden associated with HF.

AB: BACKGROUND: Despite their high rates of depression, homebound older adults have limited access to evidence‐based psychotherapy. The purpose of this paper was to report both depression and disability outcomes of telehealth problem‐solving therapy (tele‐PST via Skype video call) for low‐income homebound older adults over 6 months postintervention. METHODS: A 3‐arm randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of tele‐PST to in‐person PST and telephone care calls with 158 homebound individuals who were aged 50+ and scored 15+ on the 24‐item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). Treatment effects on depression severity (HAMD score) and disability (score on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule [WHODAS]) were analyzed using mixed‐effects regression with random intercept models. Possible reciprocal relationships between depression and disability were examined with a parallel‐process latent growth curve model. RESULTS: Both tele‐PST and in‐person PST were efficacious treatments for low‐income homebound older adults; however the effects of tele‐PST on both depression and disability outcomes were sustained significantly longer than those of in‐person PST. Effect sizes (dGMA‐raw ) for HAMD score changes at 36 weeks were 0.68 for tele‐PST and 0.20 for in‐person PST. Effect sizes for WHODAS score changes at 36 weeks were 0.47 for tele‐PST and 0.25 for in‐person PST. The results also supported reciprocal and indirect effects between depression and disability outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and potential low cost of tele‐delivered psychotherapy show its potential for easy replication and sustainability to reach a large number of underserved older adults and improve their access to mental health services.

DOI: 10.2196/jmir.4716
AB: BACKGROUND: Diabetes patients are usually started on a low dose of insulin and their dose is adjusted or "titrated" according to their blood glucose levels. Insulin titration administered through face‐to‐face visits with a clinician can be time consuming and logistically burdensome for patients, especially those of low socioeconomic status (SES). Given the wide use of mobile phones among this population, there is the potential to use short message service (SMS) text messaging and phone calls to perform insulin titration remotely. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this pilot study were to (1) evaluate if our Mobile Insulin Titration Intervention (MITI) intervention using text messaging and phone calls was effective in helping patients reach their optimal insulin glargine dose within 12 weeks, (2) assess the feasibility of the intervention within our clinic setting and patient population, (3) collect data on the cost savings associated with the intervention, and (4) measure patient satisfaction with the intervention. METHODS: This was a pilot study evaluating an intervention for patients requiring insulin glargine titration in the outpatient medical clinic of Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City. Patients in the intervention arm received weekday SMS text messages from a health management platform requesting their fasting blood glucose values. The clinic's diabetes nurse educator monitored the texted responses on the platform website each weekday for alarm values. Once a week, the nurse reviewed the glucose values, consulted the MITI titration algorithm, and called patients to adjust their insulin dose. Patients in the usual care arm continued to receive their standard clinic care for insulin titration. The primary outcome was whether a patient reached his/her optimal insulin glargine dose within 12 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients consented and were randomized into the study. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the intervention arm reached their optimal insulin glargine dose than patients in the usual care arm (88%, 29/33 vs 37%, 10/27; P<.001). Patients responded to 84.3% (420/498) of the SMS text messages requesting their blood glucose values. The nurse reached patients within 2 attempts or by voicemail 91% of the time (90/99 assigned calls). When patients traveled to the clinic, they spent a median of 45 minutes (IQR 30‐60) on travel and 39 minutes (IQR 30‐64) waiting prior to appointments. A total of 61% (37/61) of patients had appointment copays. After participating in the study, patients in the intervention arm reported higher treatment satisfaction than those in the usual care arm. CONCLUSIONS: MITI is an effective way to help low‐SES patients reach their optimal insulin glargine dose using basic SMS text messaging and phone calls. The intervention was feasible and patients were highly satisfied with their treatment. The intervention was cost saving in terms of time for patients, who were able to have their insulin titrated without multiple clinic appointments. Similar interventions should be explored to improve care for low‐SES patients managing chronic disease.

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03755063
YR: 2018
KY: Aphasia; Communication Disorders; Stroke
AB: Post‐stroke aphasia is a major cause of disability. Aphasia is a heterogeneous condition and can manifest in a variety of communication impairments, including difficulty producing words or sentences and understanding spoken and/or written language. Compared to stroke patients without aphasia, patients with aphasia have longer hospital stays, more severe disability, greater nursing care dependency, are at a greater risk for depression, are discharged to long‐term care more frequently, and are less likely to return to work, even when younger. When compared to non‐aphasic patients with similar physical abilities, well‐being and social supports, patients with aphasia engage in fewer instrumental activities of daily living (iADL) and report worse quality of life. Investigators launched the RecoverNow research program in 2014 in an attempt to address the delays to access stroke rehabilitation from acute care centres. Our concept was to use mobile tablets to "bring rehab to the patient", and leverage the significant downtime experienced by stroke survivors in acute care. A pilot feasibility study using iPads to deliver speech therapy in the acute setting was started. In this study, our speech language pathologist (SLP) personalized the iPads by selecting commercially available speech therapy applications that specifically targeted the individual patients' deficits. Patients admitted to our stroke center underwent standard of care SLP assessments, and were then offered an iPad with instructions to work with the selected apps for a minimum of 1‐hour a day. 30 patients in 6 months were enrolled, and demonstrated a recruitment rate of 68%, a retention rate of 97%, and an 83% adherence rate to a prescribed 1hour/day therapy regimen. Patients began using the tablet at a mean 6.8 days after stroke onset, for an average of 149.8 minutes/day throughout their inpatient stay. It was determined feasible to deliver speech therapy in the acute care setting using mobile tablets. Based on these preliminary studies, the research group worked with the Ottawa Hospital Mobile Health Lab (mHealth) to refine the RecoverNow platform and develop a secure customizable Android operating system‐based tablet. Briefly, this new platform is designed to be used by patients with post‐stroke aphasia, meets all security requirements of health‐care institutions, allows remote interaction between patients and SLPs, and allows patients to take the device with them as they transition from acute care to rehabilitation, home, or alternate levels of care. In summary, it was shown that it is feasible to deliver speech therapy in the acute care setting using mobile tablets. The therapeutic intervention based on our experiences, the existing literature, and patient preferences was refined. The next step is to test the efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of tablet‐based speech therapy that begins in the acute care setting. It is proposed to begin with a pilot futility design, given the limited funding envelope for a clinical trial. Using a novel futility design, this investigation will be Phase II clinical trial to test the potential efficacy of mobile tablet‐based speech therapy for post stroke aphasia. Secondary objectives include a preliminary cost‐effectiveness analysis and a capturing a variety of outcomes relevant to stroke recover to inform future studies and identify new opportunities for tablet‐based therapy.

AB: BACKGROUND: Interventions to promote mental well‐being can bring benefits to the individual and to society. The Internet can facilitate the large‐scale and low‐cost delivery of individually targeted health promoting interventions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a self‐directed Internet‐delivered cognitive‐behavioral skills training tool in improving mental well‐being in a population sample. METHODS: This was a randomized trial with a waiting‐list control. Using advertisements on a national health portal and through its mailing list, we recruited 3070 participants aged 18 or over, resident in England, and willing to give their email address and access a fully automated Web‐based intervention. The intervention (MoodGYM) consisted of 5 interactive modules that teach cognitive‐behavioral principles. Participants in the intervention arm received weekly email reminders to access the intervention. The control group received access to the intervention after the trial was completed and received no specific intervention or email reminders. Outcomes were assessed by using self‐completion questionnaires. The primary outcome was mental well‐being measured with the Warwick‐Edinburgh Mental Well‐being Scale (WEMWBS). Secondary outcomes were Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES‐D) depression scores, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7‐item scale (GAD‐7) anxiety scores, EuroQol Group 5‐Dimension Self‐Report Questionnaire (EQ‐5D) quality of life scores, physical activity, and health service use. All outcomes were measured at baseline, and at 6‐ and 12‐week follow‐ups. RESULTS: A total of 1529 (49.80%) participants completed final follow‐up at 12 weeks. Retention was 73.11% (1123/1536) in the control arm and 26.47% (406/1534) in the intervention arm. No relationship between baseline measures and withdrawal could be established. The analysis of WEMWBS mental well‐being scores using a linear mixed model for repeated measures showed no difference between intervention and control group at baseline (difference ‐0.124 points, 95% CI ‐0.814 to 0.566), and significant improvements for the intervention group at 6 weeks (2.542 points, 95% CI 1.693‐3.390) and at 12 weeks (2.876 points, 95% CI 1.933‐3.819). The model showed a highly significant (P<.001) intervention by time interaction effect. There were also significant improvements in self‐rated scores of depression and anxiety. Given the high level of attrition, a sensitivity analysis with imputed missing values was undertaken that also showed a significant positive effect of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Participants allocated to the intervention arm had an average increase of approximately 3 points on the WEMWBS scale compared to no increase for participants in the control group. Three points on this scale is approximately one‐third of a standard deviation. In a low‐cost automated intervention designed to shift the population distribution of mental well‐being, a small difference per individual could yield a major benefit in population terms. In common with other Web‐based interventions, there were high rates of attrition. Further work is needed to improve acceptability, to evaluate against placebo effect, and to disaggregate the effect on mental well‐being from the effect on depression and anxiety.

AB: Stroke Self‐Management: Effect on Function and Stroke Quality of Life Anticipated Impacts on Participant's Healthcare: This planned evaluation of the investigators' stroke self‐management program may improve the patient's healthcare by establishing an evidence‐based program for which VA case managers may implement to improve patient self‐management and the health‐related quality of life of stroke survivors. This program produced standardized manuals for case managers and stroke survivors that may be used in the field, in the patient medical care home and via telehealth. Project Background: Stroke is prevalent and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Stroke is the leading cause of long‐term disability in the US. Within the VA, approximately 60,000 patients had a primary outpatient encounter for stroke during fiscal year 2010 (FY10). Data from the Office of Quality and Performance (OQP) Stroke Special Study demonstrate that more than 5,000 Veterans were admitted to a VA facility for acute ischemic stroke in FY07 and another 5000 Veterans with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini‐stroke, were admitted in a VA facility or received care at an urgent clinic or emergency department in VA. The total VA cost of stroke treatment was almost $315 million in FY05, with a cost per patient of over $18,000. Stroke/TIA survivors are at elevated risk for future vascular events and yet, there are no systematic post stroke programs offered widely in VA designed to reduce this risk and increase stroke specific quality of life in Veterans. The investigators recently developed and pilot tested a stroke self‐management program that adapted the Stanford Chronic Disease program for stroke. Project Objectives: The objectives of this project were to: 1. Conduct a randomized trial comparing stroke survivors randomly assigned to receive a stroke self‐management program on patient functioning, stroke self‐management, and stroke specific quality of life compared to stroke survivors assigned to usual care; and 2. Conduct a summative evaluation among VA clinical providers, patients with stroke and their caregivers to understand the barriers and facilitators of implementing the stroke self‐management program. Project Methods: To accomplish these aims, the investigators employed mixed methods. For the first aim, the investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing subjects randomly assigned to the stroke self‐management intervention to subjects randomly assigned to usual care. Subjects from both groups were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. We delivered the stroke self‐management program over 6 months (12 weeks biweekly sessions followed by 12 weeks of bimonthly telephone and group support sessions). Usual care participants received written stroke risk factor materials. The primary outcomes were stroke specific quality of life and the secondary outcomes were stroke self‐management, self‐efficacy, functioning, and post stroke depression. We are evaluating clinical risk factor management after stroke.

AB: INTERVENTION: Study subjects will be connected to the backend monitoring via a usual primary care visit and set up through Florence©, Simple Telehealth, Web‐based monitoring system (Stoke on Trent, NHS England) (www.florence.co.net). Test runs undertaken locally confirm that the system is 3G compatible so does not require 4G or WiFi but does require a reliable mobile phone signal. The patient will be trained in the use of the Tm equipment and will need to demonstrate satisfactory understanding of text messaging before the patient consents to use. The study subject will use a provided blood glucose monitoring device for the measurement of blood glucose levels and will be sent reminders to perform their blood glucose readings by an automated programme. The device feeds back the blood glucose level to the patient who then uses a gateway device manually or automatically to transmit the data to an automated programme. This programme analyses the data according to an individualised set of parameters and provides instant feedback to the patient via their gateway device along with locally agreed advice messages if required. Should a parameter be critically breached the patient will be advised on immediate action and who to contact. An alert message will also be sent to their primary health care provider which can be reviewed immediately (or the next working day if the anomalous parameter occurs out of working hours). During the study, the subject will also receive standardised, weekly, health coaching messages and study subjects will be reminded upon entering the study and through the Patient Information Sheet that if they require the attention of a healthcare professional in relation to their diabetes and the message that they have received, that it is their responsibility to make the contact. The devices used for the Tm will be the patient?s own unless they do not already have one, in which case one will be supplied by their GP surgery as part of their routine care.

However, no study has been reported yet regarding telehaptic palpation using mobile phone images for teledermatology or teleconsultations of skincare. METHODS: This study is therefore aimed at introducing a new algorithm accurately reconstructing a haptic augmented skin surface for telehaptic palpation using a low‐cost clip‐on microscope simply attached to a mobile phone. Multiple algorithms such as gradient‐based image enhancement, roughness‐adaptive tactile mask generation, roughness‐enhanced 3D tactile map building, and visual and haptic rendering with a three‐degrees‐of‐freedom (DOF) haptic device were developed and integrated as one system. RESULTS: Evaluation experiments have been conducted to test the performance of 3D roughness reconstruction with/without the tactile mask. The results confirm that reconstructed haptic roughness with the tactile mask is superior to the reconstructed haptic roughness without the tactile mask. Additional experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is robust against varying lighting conditions and blurring. In last, a user study has been designed to see the effect of the haptic modality to the existing visual only interface and the results attest that the haptic skin palpation can significantly improve the skin exam performance. CONCLUSION: Mobile image‐based telehaptic palpation technology was proposed, and an initial version was developed. The developed technology was tested with several skin images and the experimental results showed the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of the performance of haptic augmentation of real skin images.

AB: Aims: Remote management of heart failure using implantable electronic devices (REM‐HF) aimed to assess the clinical and cost‐effectiveness of remote monitoring (RM) of heart failure in patients with cardiac implanted electronic devices (CIEDs). Methods and results: Between 29 September 2011 and 31 March 2014, we randomly assigned 1650 patients with heart failure and a CIED to active RM or usual care (UC). The active RM pathway included formalized remote follow‐up protocols, and UC was standard practice in nine recruiting centres in England. The primary endpoint in the time to event analysis was the 1st event of death from any cause or unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. Secondary endpoints included death from any cause, death from cardiovascular reasons, death from cardiovascular reasons and unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization, unplanned cardiovascular hospitalization, and unplanned hospitalization. REM‐HF is registered with ISRCTN (96536028). The mean age of the population was 70 years (range 23‐98); 86% were male. Patients were followed for a median of 2.8 years (range 0‐4.3 years) completing on 31 January 2016. Patient adherence was high with a drop out of 4.3% over the course of the study. The incidence of the primary endpoint did not differ significantly between active RM and UC groups, which occurred in 42.4 and 40.8% of patients, respectively [hazard ratio 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87‐1.18; P = 0.87]. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to any of the secondary endpoints or the time to the primary endpoint components. Conclusion: Among patients with heart failure and a CIED, RM using weekly downloads and a formalized follow up approach does not improve outcomes.

DOI: 10.1177/2396987318770127
AB: Background and Aims: Despite best medical management, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and acute ischaemic strokes have high risk of early neurological deterioration, recurrent strokes and death, particularly in first 12 weeks. Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is a low‐cost intervention that may improve cerebral perfusion and prevent recurrent stroke. We tested the hypothesis that self or caregiver delivered early RIC in acute ischaemic stroke for the first 12 weeks is feasible and safe. Method: Adult TIA and ischaemic stroke patients presenting within first 48 h of symptom onset were screened. Patients with a MRI evidence of acute infarct were randomized (1:1) to receive either 4 or 6‐cycles of RIC therapy sessions two times daily in both arms for 12 weeks. All patients underwent MRI, CT perfusion, Endothelial dependent flow mediated dilation assessment and Ankle brachial index at baseline, 7 days and 12 weeks. Results: A total of 60 patients with mean±SD age of 59.4±12.4years were randomised to either 4‐cycles group (n=29) or 6‐cycles group (n=31). The median (IQR) baseline NIHSS was 5 (3‐8) in the 4‐cycles group and 3.5(2‐7) in the 6‐cycles group. Transeint capillary fragility was noted in 2 patients each with 4‐cycles and 6‐cycles groups. Eighty percent patients in 4‐cycles group and 90% in 6‐cycles completed 12 weeks of RIC therapy delivered by themselves or by the caregiver. Conclusion: Short‐term self or caregiver delivered RIC therapy is safe and feasible in acute ischaemic stroke patients. A randomised control is needed to prove the efficacy of RIC therapy to reduce infarct growth and recurrent stroke.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a telehealth system, using digital pen‐and‐paper technology and a modified smartphone, to remotely monitor and support the effectiveness of wound management in nursing home residents. METHOD: A randomised controlled pilot study was conducted in selected nursing homes in Bradford, which were randomised to either the control or evaluation group. All patients with a wound of any aetiology or severity, resident in the selected nursing homes were considered eligible to participate in the study. Residents in the control homes who had, or developed, a wound during the study period, continued to receive unsupported care directed by the nursing home staff (defined as 'standard care'), while those in the evaluation homes received standard care supported by input from the remote experts. RESULTS: Thirty‐nine patients with a wound were identified in the 16 participating Bradford nursing homes. Analysis of individual patient management pathways suggested that the system provided improved patient outcomes and that it may offer cost savings by improving dressing product selection, decreasing inappropriate onward referral and speeding healing. Despite initial anxiety related to the technology most nursing‐home staff found the system of value and many were keen to see the trial continue to form part of routine patient management. CONCLUSION: The current study supports the potential value of telemedicine in wound care and indicates the value that such a system may have to nursing‐home staff and patients. DECLARATION OF INTEREST: This study was funded by a Regional Innovation Fund grant from the Yorkshire and Humberside Strategic Health Authority.

AB: Objectives: To determine the awareness and willingness‐to‐pay for smart healthcare among the general population of Korea Methods: A survey was conducted during December of 2017 using data obtained via an Internet‐based survey from 500 randomized people between 20‐59 years old. To make a generalized selection, it was conducted across the nation on a pro‐rata basis covering seven regions. The survey instrument included questions regarding demographics, preferences, importance and affordability Results: About smart healthcare awareness, 78.2% of respondents replied that they had heard about smart healthcare but only 14% were well‐informed about it. The main channels of exposure to information were from internet news articles, TV news and health information programs 74% of respondents replied that they would like to use smart healthcare services, 22% were neutral, and 5% replied that they did not intend to use a service. Regarding a willingness to pay, 51% of respondents replied that they were not willing to pay more than 10,000KRW per month while 28% replied that 10,000~30,000KRW was acceptable, 13% replied that they were willing to pay 50,000~100,000KRW, and 2% replied that 100,000KRW was tolerable One‐way remote‐monitoring is allowed under medical law in Korea but only 20% were aware of this, while 80% of respondents were misinformed This survey has a 95% confidence level with a +/‐4.4% sampling error Conclusions: As a result of the population aging and an increase of healthcare expenditure, interest in cost‐effective healthcare services has been rising while the healthcare service paradigm has been gradually shifting from treatment to prediction, prevention and personalized medicine. Aligned with this trend, smart healthcare services will play an important role for effective disease management and improved quality of life. We could find that to make that happen, providing the right information to the general population and developing prescient political system are very important Copyright © 2018

AB: BACKGROUND: Vocal local (VL) is a non‐pharmacological pain management technique for gynecological procedures. In Africa, it is usually used in combination with pharmacological analgesics. However, analgesics are associated with side‐effects, and can be costly and subject to frequent stock‐outs, particularly in remote rural settings. We compared the effectiveness of VL + local anesthesia + analgesics (the standard approach), versus VL + local anesthesia without analgesics, on pain and satisfaction levels for women undergoing tubal ligations in rural Kenya. METHODS: We conducted a site‐randomised non‐inferiority trial of 884 women receiving TLs from 40 Marie Stopes mobile outreach sites in Kisii and Machakos Districts. Twenty sites provided VL + local anesthesia + analgesics (control), while 20 offered VL + local anesthesia without additional analgesics (intervention). Pain was measured using a validated 11‐point Numeric Rating Scale; satisfaction was measured using 11‐point scales. RESULTS: A total of 461 women underwent tubal ligations with VL + local anesthesia, while 423 received tubal ligations with VL + local anesthesia + analgesics. The majority were aged ≥30 years (78%), and had >3 children (99%). In a multivariate analysis, pain during the procedure was not significantly different between the two groups. The pain score after the procedure was significantly lower in the intervention group versus the control group (by 0.40 points; p = 0.041). Satisfaction scores were equally high in both groups; 96% would recommend the procedure to a friend. CONCLUSION: VL + local anesthesia is as effective as VL + local anesthesia + analgesics for pain management during tubal ligation in rural Kenya. Avoiding analgesics is associated with numerous benefits including cost savings and fewer issues related to the maintenance, procurement and monitoring of restricted opioid drugs, particularly in remote low‐resource settings where these systems are weak.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease and dementia share a number of risk factors including hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, smoking, obesity, diabetes and physical inactivity. The rise of eHealth has led to increasing opportunities for large‐scale delivery of prevention programmes encouraging self‐management. The aim of this study is to investigate whether a multidomain intervention to optimise self‐management of cardiovascular risk factors in older individuals, delivered through an coach‐supported interactive internet platform, can improve the cardiovascular risk profile and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: HATICE is a multinational, multicentre, prospective, randomised, open‐label blinded end point (PROBE) trial with 18 months intervention. Recruitment of 2600 older people (≥65 years) at increased risk of cardiovascular disease will take place in the Netherlands, Finland and France. Participants randomised to the intervention condition will have access to an interactive internet platform, stimulating self‐management of vascular risk factors, with remote support by a coach. Participants in the control group will have access to a static internet platform with basic health information.The primary outcome is a composite score based on the average z‐score of the difference between baseline and 18 months follow‐up values of systolic blood pressure, low‐density‐lipoprotein and body mass index. Main secondary outcomes include the effect on the individual components of the primary outcome, the effect on lifestyle‐related risk factors, incident cardiovascular disease, mortality, cognitive functioning, mood and cost‐effectiveness. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Ouest et Outre Mer in France and the Northern Savo Hospital District Research Ethics Committee in Finland.We expect that data from this study will result in a manuscript published in a peer‐reviewed clinical open access journal.

AB: Background: Creative, cost‐effective interventions to improve the quality of care of chronic illnesses are needed. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of remote physician‐pharmacist team‐based care on cholesterol levels in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods: This 2‐year prospective, cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted within the Providence Primary Care Research Network in Oregon. Participants at least 18 years of age were identified by a diagnosis of DM. The intervention included remote physician‐pharmacist teambased care focused on cholesterol management in DM. All clinicians in the study had access to the health information technology tool CareManager, which provided automated DM‐related point‐of‐care prompts, a Web‐based registry, and performance feedback with benchmarking. Study outcomes included the difference in low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) goal attainment, mean LDL‐C, prescribed lipid‐lowering therapy, and patient satisfaction between the intervention and control arms. Results: A total of 6963 patients with DM cared for by 68 physicians in 9 clinics were evaluated. Patients in the intervention arm were more likely to achieve their target LDL‐C levels compared with controls (78% vs 50%; P=.003). The mean LDL‐C level was 12 mg/dL lower in the intervention arm compared with the control arm (P<.001). The rate of LDL‐C testing was significantly higher in the intervention arm compared with the control arm. Patients in the intervention arm were also 15% more likely to receive a prescription for a lipid‐lowering medication (P=.008). There was no significant difference in patient satisfaction between study arms (P=.15). Conclusion: Remotely located physician‐pharmacist team‐based care resulted in significantly improved LDL‐C levels and goal attainment among patients with DM. 2011 American Medical Association.

DESIGN: A total of 102 participants (mean ± SD age, 46.5 ± 12.7 yrs; body mass index, 32.0 ± 5.8 kg/m(2)) with a physical disability (spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, stroke, or lupus) were randomized to one of three conditions: physical activity only (POWERS), physical activity plus nutrition (POWERS(plus)), and control. The POWERS group received a physical activity tool kit and regular coaching telephone calls. The POWERS(plus) group received an intervention identical to that of the POWERS group plus nutritional information. The control group received the physical activity tool kit and self‐guided health promotion resources at the completion of the trial but no coaching. RESULTS: Postintervention differences in body weight were found between the groups. There was a significant group × time interaction (P < 0.01) in postintervention body weight, with both the POWERS and POWERS(plus) groups demonstrating greater reduction in body weight compared with the control group (POWERS: ‐2.1 ± 5.5 kg, ‐2.4 ± ‐5.9%; POWERS(plus): ‐0.5 ± 5.0 kg, ‐0.6 ± 4.3%; control: +2.6 ± 5.3 kg, 3.1 ± 7.4%). CONCLUSIONS: A low‐cost telephone intervention supported with a Web‐based remote coaching tool (POWERS) can be an effective strategy for assisting overweight adults with physical disabilities in maintaining or reducing their body weight.

AB: Introduction: Telemedicine attracts the attention of health care providers and payers due to possibly increased safety and cost‐effectiveness issues. Objective: Comparison of the standard approach in the outpatient follow‐up after implantation of cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) with the remote follow‐up using the access to the Home Monitoring (HM) service (BIOTRONIK) with respect to workload, efficiency and safety in ambulatory care. Methods: 198 patients (67+12 years, 81% men) with newly implanted dual or single chamber ICD (165/35) were followed prospectively. One‐third represented patients with primary prevention indications. Mean follow‐up was 620+215 days. Patients were randomized to standard outpatient management (HM‐) group and remotely monitored group (HM+). We evaluated regular outpatient visits, emergency visits, delivered shock therapy, and their adequacy and hospitalization associated with the ICD. Geographical data and availability of the access to the cardiology department were also analyzed. Results: Both groups of patients were comparable with respect to the demographical data, clinical data and parameters of the ICD with significant difference only in the representation of single and dual chamber devices between the groups. Almost two‐thirds of the total 621 outpatient controls were carried out in the HM‐ group. The number of planned inspections decreased by more than 40% in the HM+ group, but the number of extra controls with the physician assistance called upon the inspection of HM messages significantly increased. Mortality did not differ significantly in both groups as well as the number of hospitalized patients and patients with delivered shock therapy. The proportion of inadequate shocks, however, was significantly reduced in the HM+ group. Conclusion: Home Monitoring system proved to be effective in reducing the number of planned visits and the proportion of inadequate shock therapy with no impact on the overall mortality in our patient group. Patients with poorer accessibility of the adequate medical management tend to prefer to be monitored remotely.

AB: Introduction: Rural Andhra Pradesh has a large disease burden attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) with significant under‐utilisation of evidence based low‐cost preventive medications.[ 1] Primary care physicians are first point of contact and the main providers of healthcare for individuals with CVDs. In low and middle income countries too few doctors exist and physician workforce disparities for rural and remote regions are very substantial.[2, 3] Objectives: In response to the health workforce shortage in rural regions, we designed, implemented and evaluated a CVD prevention strategy that could be delivered by nonphysician healthcare workers (NPHWs) Methods: This study was a cluster‐randomised control trial done in 44 villages located in the Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh, India. Villages were randomised to receive the intervention package which involved the use of an algorithm designed to increase the identification and treatment of individuals at high‐risk of CVD and to be used by NPHWs. High‐risk individuals were referred to physicians for initiation of treatment. The primary outcome was the proportion of high‐risk individuals identified. Results: Outcomes were assessed between 12 and 24 months amongst 1135 high‐risk individuals. The clinical algorithm increased the proportion of high‐risk individuals identified (63.3% versus 51.4%, p=0.028). By following the algorithm, NPHWs were able to make clinical care recommendations identical to those of physicians in 87% of cases studied. Conclusion: Models of care that train and empower NPHWs to diagnose and treat highrisk individuals appear to have considerable potential for the management of CVD in resource poor settings.

AB: Background/Purpose: Prostate cancer patients with localised disease have a good prognosis but experience acute and long‐term effects of radiotherapy (up to 20% gastrointestinal problems, and 30‐45% post‐radiotherapy sexual dysfunction). The true extent is undoubtedly underestimated, as adverse events (AE) are rarely systematically recorded and under‐reported in clinician assessments. We have proposed a feasible cost‐effective model allowing remote measurement of radiotherapy AE. eRAPID is a web‐based electronic patient reporting system including severity linked notifications/self‐management advice (an RCT assessing feasibility in systemic therapy is underway). An eRAPID system for patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy is being developed in St James's Institute of Oncology, Leeds and the Christie Hospital, Manchester. Methods: N= 10 prostate cancer patients completed weekly online symptom reports (or when unwell) via eRAPID during radical radiotherapy. To assess usability and engagement with eRAPID, patients completed the System Usability Scale and took part in an end‐of‐study audio‐recorded interview. Results: Patients were recruited over a 6‐week period (Mean age 70 range 63‐84), and compliance for weekly completion was 100%. All patients 'strongly agreed' that the system was easy to use and 90% patients 'agreed or strongly agreed' they had confidence in using the system. In interviews, patients described eRAPID to be 'a reassuring tool' giving them 'peace of mind'. Conclusions: Patients found the system easy to use and a beneficial adjunct to usual care despite daily visits to the RT department. A multi‐site randomised pilot study is planned with 168 prostate, gynaecological, anal and rectal patients in Leeds and Manchester.

AB: BACKGROUND: Hospitals are frequently faced with high levels of emergency department presentations and demand for inpatient care. An important contributing factor is the subset of patients with complex chronic diseases who have frequent and preventable exacerbations of their chronic diseases. Evidence suggests that some of these hospital readmissions can be prevented with appropriate transitional care. Whilst there is a growing body of evidence for transitional care processes in urban, non‐indigenous settings, there is a paucity of information regarding rural and remote settings and, specifically, the indigenous context. METHODS: This randomised control trial compares a tailored, multidimensional transitional care package to usual care. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the transitional care package for Indigenous and non‐Indigenous Australian patients with chronic diseases at risk of recurrent readmission with the aim of reducing readmission rates and improving transition to primary care in a remote setting. Patients will be recruited from medical and surgical admissions to Alice Springs Hospital and will be followed for 12 months. The primary outcome measure will be number of admissions to hospital with secondary outcomes including number of emergency department presentations, number of ICU admissions, days alive and out of hospital, time to primary care review post discharge and cost‐effectiveness. DISCUSSION: Successful transition from hospital to home is important for patients with complex chronic diseases. Evidence suggests that a coordinated transitional care plan can result in a reduction in length of hospital stay and readmission rates for adults with complex medical needs. This will be the first study to evaluate a tailored multidimensional transitional care intervention to prevent readmission in Indigenous and non‐Indigenous Australian residents of remote Australia who are frequently admitted to hospital. If demonstrated to be effective it will have implications for the care and management of Indigenous Australians throughout regional and remote Australia and in other remote, culturally and linguistically diverse populations and settings.

AB: Within recent years, public health interventions have become technology based to reflect the digital age we currently live in and appeal to the public in innovative and novel ways. The Internet breaks down boundaries distance imposes and increases our ability to reach and connect with people. Internet‐based interventions have the potential to expand access to effective behavioral interventions (EBIs). The US National HIV/AIDS Strategy states that people living with HIV should have access to EBIs such as healthy relationships (HR) to help them develop safe sex and disclosure skills. However, access to HR is limited across the country, especially for people in remote or rural areas. Internet‐based healthy relationships video groups (HR‐VG) delivered at home or community‐based organizations (CBOs) can possibly expand access. This study assesses the preferences of women living with HIV (WLH) for participation in HR‐VG among 21 WLH who participated in a randomized control trial (RCT) testing HR‐VG and completed open‐ended semi‐structured telephone interviews. Transcripts were thematically analyzed to determine advantages and disadvantages of home or CBO delivery of HR‐VG. Themes relating to convenience, technology access, privacy, distractions, HIV serostatus disclosure, and social opportunities were identified as advantages or disadvantages to participating in HR‐VG at each location. Overall, privacy was the most salient concern of accessing HR‐VG at home or at a CBO. Considering the concerns expressed by WLH, further studies are needed to assess how an Internet‐based intervention delivered at home for WLH can maintain privacy while being cost effective.

AB: Aims: With current time pressures on laparoscopic training, it is vital that new educational strategies be employed to optimally utilize the period available for skill acquisition. Review of task performance videos (with a tutor's voiced‐over oral feedback) aids the short‐term laparoscopic training of experienced learners. We examined the long‐term effects of using this strategy, versus regular practice, on laparoscopic suturing skills in novices. Methods: After 4 practice sessions, 14 novices (7 per group) were randomized post recording of task video (to eliminate bias) to engage in either twice‐weekly regular practice (group A) or review of their fourth trial video [with voiced‐over oral feedback] (group B). Only subjects in group B received their task videos. Remote monitoring of sessions was via YouTube™ analytics. Results: Averages over 4 trials, of performance time and errors, were obtained after 4 to 6 weeks. Errors were assessed with Group C completed the task faster but not significantly so (p values B Vs A=0.9555). There were significantly less errors in group A compared to group B (p=0.0481). In addition, less errors were noted in those subjects in group B who reviewed their combined visual and oral feedback video just before or on the day of assessment (Just prior to assessment: OSATS scores[18 out of 20; OSATS scores<18 out of 20) Conclusion (50 words max): In comparison to regular, review of performance videos (with voiced‐over oral feedback) produces significantly better technical ability with comparable performance time. It maximizes skill retention in novices (in the long term) learning core laparoscopic procedures and is may be suitable for mastery of more advanced procedures by experienced trainees. Key Statement (50 words max): This strategy produces safer surgeons at little or no cost. Performance videos, incorporating voicedover oral feedback, can be created using smart phones (simulated sessions) and laparoscopic recorders, with audio input provided form wireless head‐mounted microphones on the tutor.

AB: Obesity prevalence is higher in rural compared to urban residents. Rural health clinics offer a potential venue for delivery of weight management. However, traditional programs require travel to attend on‐site meetings which is impractical or inconvenient for rural residents. Clinic staff in most rural settings are unlikely to be trained to provide effective weight management. Remote delivery using group phone conferences (GP) or individual phone calls (IP), by staff associated with rural clinics eliminates the need for travel to attend on‐site meetings. The effectiveness of these approaches will be the focus of this trial. Staff at five primary care clinics, serving primarily rural residents, will be trained to deliver GP and IP interventions and an enhanced usual care (EUC), (i.e., individual face‐to‐face meetings (~45 min) at clinic site, four times across 18 mos.). Two hundred overweight/obese adults (BMI >= 25.0‐45.0 kg/m2, age >= 21 yrs.) will be recruited through each clinic and randomized to GP (n = 80), IP (n = 80), or EUC (n = 40) to compare weight loss (0‐6 mos.), weight maintenance (7‐18 mos.), and weight change during a 6 mo. no contact follow‐up (19‐24 mos.) between intervention arms. The GP and IP interventions will be identical in lesson plan content, diet, and physical activity. The only difference between groups will be the delivery format (group vs. individual) and session duration (GP ~45 min/session; IP ~15 min/session). Primary (body weight) and secondary outcomes (waist circumference, energy/macronutrient intake, physical activity) will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 mos. Cost and contingent valuation analyses will also be completed. NCT registration: NCT02932748. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB: BACKGROUND: Approximately 70% of Australian adults aged over 50 are overweight or obese, with the prevalence significantly higher in regional/remote areas compared to cities. This study aims to determine if a low‐cost, accessible lifestyle program targeting insufficiently active adults aged 50‐69 y can be successfully implemented in a rural location, and whether its implementation will contribute to the reduction/prevention of metabolic syndrome, or other risk factors for type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. METHODS/DESIGN: This 6‐month randomised controlled trial will consist of a nutrition, physical activity, and healthy weight intervention for 50‐69 year‐olds from a disadvantaged rural community. Five hundred participants with central obesity and at risk of metabolic syndrome will be recruited from Albany and surrounding areas in Western Australia (within a 50 kilometre radius of the town). They will be randomly assigned to either the intervention (n = 250) or wait‐listed control group (n = 250). The theoretical concepts in the study utilise the Self‐Determination Theory, complemented by Motivational Interviewing. The intervention will include a custom‐designed booklet and interactive website that provides information, and encourages physical activity and nutrition goal setting, and healthy weight management. The booklet and website will be supplemented by an exercise chart, calendar, newsletters, resistance bands, accelerometers, and phone and email contact from program staff. Data will be collected at baseline and post‐intervention. DISCUSSION: This study aims to contribute to the prevention of metabolic syndrome and inter‐ related chronic illnesses: type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers; which are associated with overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet. This large rural community‐based trial will provide guidelines for recruitment, program development, implementation, and evaluation, and has the potential to translate findings into practice by expanding the program to other regional areas in Australia.

AB: Background: In radiotherapy, precise targeting is required to kill cancer cells and minimize impact on healthy cells. The dose delivered by radiation treatment machines is audited by independent organizations. Conventional audits are performed through site visits or mailing dosimeters to the centers, involving either high cost or increased measurement uncertainties. Aim: This study lays the foundation for remotely auditing of radiotherapy machines. Using center images from readily available electronic imagers, it measures central pixel value (CPV) and gravitational sag of the imager and. It then models delivered dose. Method: Images of eight centers were used in this pilot study. CPV: Two 10 x 10 cm2 images with different collimator angles were used to determine CPV. Values of 50% points of each image width were calculated using linear interpolation and then, they were normalized to approximate CPV. Mean value of the points was considered as CPV. Sag: 10 x 10 images acquired at every 45degree gantry angle were employed to model sag values. CPV of 0degree image was calculated and compared with CPV of images acquired at other angles. The difference versus gantry angle showed best fit with first order of Fourier series. Finally, the corrections are used to model complex delivered dose distributions. Results: CPV and sag were modeled for each center. Sag parameters were identified with 99.2% (SD: 0.94%) mean R‐square fitting over the centers. Applying the corrections, delivered open field doses were modeled with mean isocenter dose discrepancy of 0.04% (SD: 0.11%). Conclusion: The characterization method could be consistently applied to all centers. The remote audit approach is inexpensive and fast. It is feasible since all radiotherapy machines are equipped with similar imagers. Translational research aspect: This project falls into the T1‐T2 translational pipeline. Fundamental research on imagers resulted in a novel application for remote assessment of treatment delivery at various centers.

AB: Pediatric functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) are associated with increased health care utilization, school absences, and poor quality of life (QoL). Cost‐effective and accessible interventions are needed. This multisite study tested the effects of a 3‐session cognitive behavioral intervention delivered to parents, in‐person or remotely, on the primary outcome of pain severity and secondary outcomes (process measures) of parental solicitousness, pain beliefs, catastrophizing, and child‐reported coping. Additional outcomes hypothesized a priori and assessed included functional disability, QoL, pain behavior, school absences, health care utilization, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The study was prospective and longitudinal (baseline and 3 and 6 months' follow‐up) with 3 randomized conditions: social learning and cognitive behavioral therapy in‐person (SLCBT) or by phone (SLCBT‐R) and education and support condition by phone (ES‐R). Participants were children aged 7 to 12 years with FAPD and their parents (N = 316 dyads). Although no significant treatment effect for pain severity was found, the SLCBT groups showed significantly greater improvements compared with controls on process measures of parental solicitousness, pain beliefs, and catastrophizing, and additional outcomes of parent‐reported functional disability, pain behaviors, child health care visits for abdominal pain, and (remote condition only) QoL and missed school days. No effects were found for parent and child‐reported gastrointestinal symptoms, or child‐reported QoL or coping. These findings suggest that for children with FAPD, a brief phone SLCBT for parents can be similarly effective as in‐person SLCBT in changing parent responses and improving outcomes, if not reported pain and symptom report, compared with a control condition.

AB: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) is a randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether screening with low‐dose helical computed tomography reduces lung cancer mortality relative to screening with conventional chest x‐ray in persons at elevated risk of lung cancer. As the coordinating center (CC) for NLSTs Lung Screening Study component (NLST/LSS), we are responsible for systems development and central database management for ten sites that enrolled 34,614 participants, with the goal of ensuring the production of quality data. The NLST/LSS utilizes the Integrated Data Entry and Administration System (IDEAS), a distributed study management system that supports remote data entry with nightly replication of data from site servers to the central database. IDEAS performs standard data quality assurance (QA) tasks including front‐end logic checks and forms tracking but lacks a mechanism for performing edit check overrides and back‐end logic checks. Initially, these data QA tasks were handled manually by distributing edit forms to sites using e‐mail or regular mail. However, with time and an increase in data volume, the need arose for a more efficient and cost‐ effective approach. In response, we designed a user‐friendly Web‐ based data QA system that enables CC staff to generate and upload pre‐programmed data cleaning tasks for immediate viewing, printing, and resolution by sites. In addition, nightly interaction with the IDEAS database facilitates swift task close‐out, resulting in more timely availability of cleaned data. This presentation will highlight the unique features of this efficient tool, illustrate how its implementation has streamlined the data QA process for NLST/LSS, and explore the lessons learned along the way.

AB: BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing use of pre‐ and post‐hydration protocols and low osmolar instead of high osmolar iodine containing contrast media, the incidence of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) is still significant. There is evidence that contrast media cause ischemia reperfusion injury of the renal medulla. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a non‐invasive, safe, and low cost method to reduce ischemia reperfusion injury. The aim of this study is to investigate whether RIPC, as an adjunct to standard preventive measures, reduces contrast induced acute kidney injury in patients at risk of CIN. METHODS: The RIPCIN study is a multicenter, single blinded, randomized controlled trial in which 76 patients at risk of CIN received standard hydration combined with RIPC or hydration with sham preconditioning. RIPC was applied by four cycles of 5 min ischemia and 5 min reperfusion of the forearm. The primary outcome measure was the change in serum creatinine from baseline to 48 to 72 hours after contrast administration. RESULTS: With regard to the primary endpoint, no significant effect of RIPC was found. CIN occurred in four patients (2 sham and 2 RIPC). A pre‐defined subgroup analysis of patients with a Mehran risk score ≥11, showed a significantly reduced change in serum creatinine from baseline to 48 to 72 hours in patients allocated to the RIPC group (Δ creatinine ‐3.3 ± 9.8 μmol/L) compared with the sham group (Δ creatinine +17.8 ± 20.1 μmol/L). CONCLUSION: RIPC, as an adjunct to standard preventive measures, does not improve serum creatinine levels after contrast administration in patients at risk of CIN according to the Dutch guideline. However, the present data indicate that RIPC might have beneficial effects in patients at a high or very high risk of CIN (Mehran score ≥ 11). The RIPCIN study is registered at: http://www.controlled‐trials.com/ISRCTN76496973.

AB: Introduction/Background: Knee osteoarthritis is a major cause of disability among the middle to senior age groups. Despite being effective, office‐based physical therapy (OBPT) needs professional human resources and is both costly and time‐consuming. We aimed to compare the efficacy of tele‐rehabilitation (tele‐rehab) compared with OBPT in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Material and method: In this randomized clinical trial, patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee were assigned to participate in either a 6‐week home‐based tele‐rehab or an OBPT program between 2015 and 2016. Our primary outcome was the mean change from the baseline until 1 and 6 month's post‐intervention in scores of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). We used analysis of variance for the repeated measure statistical test. Results: A total of 54 patients entered the final analysis, with 27 in each group. The mean age of the patients was 58.2‐7.41years and 60.2% were female. In the tele‐rehab and OBPT group, KOOS scores increased from baseline to 6 months post‐intervention (50.6 to 83.1 and 49.8 to 81.8) respectively. There was no significant difference between tele‐rehab and OBPT groups in any of the studied scales. Conclusion/Discussion: The tele‐rehab program is as effective as OBPT in improving the function of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Considering the much lower time and cost consumed by tele‐rehab, it is the recommended program for the older population living in remote sites. Copyright © 2018

DOI: 10.1007/s00520-012-1479-7
AB: Introduction: A mobile phone‐based system (ASyMS‐H) was developed to remotely monitor key chemotherapy toxicities in 'real time' (e.g. fever/infection, bleeding, nausea/vomiting, mucositis, diarrhoea) alongside algorithms to alert treating clinicians (via SMS) of significant toxicities and to provide tailored evidence‐based self‐care information to patients. Objective: The objective was to pilot ASyMS‐H with patients/nurses and obtain feedback for system refinement. Methods: A convenience sample of haematological cancer patients used ASyMS‐H twice daily for one cycle of chemotherapy. Nurses monitoring automated alerts, as well as patients, completed semistructured interviews which were audio‐recorded, transcribed and underwent qualitative analyses. Basic system usage frequencies were collected. Results: Seventeen patients (mean age, 49 years) with non‐Hodgkin (ten), Hodgkin's lymphoma (five) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (two) used ASyMS‐H for a total of 365 days and competed interviews. Thirty‐two alerts (red, 11; amber, 21) were generated most commonly for nausea (nine) and mucositis (eight). Nine cancer nurses used ASyMS‐H and completed interviews. The use of ASyMS‐H was supported by patients/nurses with common themes, including: good fit with patient/nurse routine; ease of use; source of patient reassurance/ empowerment; enabling early intervention, promoting communication and potential use for predictive symptom modeling. Patient guilt over generating alerts was noted; however, nurses felt alerts were appropriate for clinical intervention. Suggested changes to the system included additional symptoms and disease‐specific information and improved symptom descriptors. Conclusions: ASyMS‐H was highly valued and the feedback used to build an amended version of the system. ASyMS‐H is currently incorporated into a unique nurse‐led supportive care/educational intervention, with improvements in patient outcomes/cost effectiveness investigated in a randomized controlled trial.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Expanded access to efficacious interventions is needed for women living with human immunodeficiency virus (WLH) in the United States. Availability of "prevention with (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV)] positives" interventions in rural/remote and low HIV prevalence areas remains limited, leaving WLH in these communities few options for receiving effective behavioral interventions such as Healthy Relationships (HR). Offering such programs via videoconferencing groups (VGs) may expand access. This analysis tests the effectiveness of HR‐VG (versus wait‐list control) for reducing sexual risk behavior among WLH and explores intervention satisfaction. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial unprotected vaginal/anal sex occasions over the prior 3 months reported at the 6‐month follow‐up were compared across randomization groups through zero‐inflated Poisson regression modeling, controlling for unprotected sex at baseline. Seventy‐one WLH were randomized and completed the baseline assessment (n=36 intervention and n=35 control); 59 (83% in each group) had follow‐up data. RESULTS: Among those who engaged in unprotected sex at 6‐month follow‐up, intervention participants had approximately seven fewer unprotected occasions than control participants (95% confidence interval 5.43‐7.43). Intervention participants reported high levels of satisfaction with HR‐VG; 84% reported being "very satisfied" overall. CONCLUSIONS: This study found promising evidence for effective dissemination of HIV risk reduction interventions via VGs. Important next steps will be to determine whether VGs are effective with other subpopulations of people living with HIV (i.e., men and non‐English speakers) and to assess cost‐effectiveness. Possibilities for using VGs to expand access to other psychosocial and behavioral interventions and reduce stigma are discussed.

AB: Cancer survival continues to improve, and thus cardiovascular consequences of chemotherapy are increasingly important determinants of long‐term morbidity and mortality. Conventional strategies to protect the heart from chemotherapy have important hemodynamic or myelosuppressive side effects. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) using intermittent limb ischemia‐reperfusion reduces myocardial injury in the setting of percutaneous coronary intervention. Anthracycline cardiotoxicity and ischemia‐reperfusion injury share common biochemical pathways in cardiomyocytes. The potential for RIC as a novel treatment to reduce subclinical myocyte injury in chemotherapy has never been explored and will be investigated in the Effect of Remote Ischaemic Conditioning in Oncology (ERIC‐ONC) trial (clinicaltrials.gov NCT 02471885). The ERIC‐ONC trial is a single‐center, blinded, randomized, sham‐controlled study. We aim to recruit 128 adult oncology patients undergoing anthracycline‐based chemotherapy treatment, randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2 groups: (1) sham procedure or (2) RIC, comprising 4, 5‐minute cycles of upper arm blood pressure cuff inflations and deflations, immediately before each cycle of chemotherapy. The primary outcome measure, defining cardiac injury, will be high‐sensitivity troponin‐T over 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 12 months follow‐up. Secondary outcome measures will include clinical, electrical, structural, and biochemical endpoints comprising major adverse cardiovascular clinical events, incidence of cardiac arrhythmia over 14 days at cycle 5/6, echocardiographic ventricular function, N‐terminal pro‐brain natriuretic peptide levels at 3 months follow‐up, and changes in mitochondrial DNA, micro‐RNA, and proteomics after chemotherapy. The ERIC‐ONC trial will determine the efficacy of RIC as a novel, noninvasive, nonpharmacological, low‐cost cardioprotectant in cancer patients undergoing anthracycline‐based chemotherapy.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Registry data demonstrate considerably low complication rates after implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) procedures for primary prevention of sudden death. Yet standard of care includes postimplant overnight in‐hospital observation that may levy substantial unnecessary financial burden on health care systems. In appropriate patients, discharge soon after implant could translate into significant cost savings, if such practice does not result in complications. We applied a simple clinical algorithm to assess feasibility of discharge on the same day of ICD implantation in patients at low risk for procedural complications. METHODS: We prospectively randomized primary prevention ICD candidates at low risk for complications (not pacing‐dependent or requiring bridging heparin anticoagulation) to next‐day discharge with overnight in‐hospital observation, or same‐day discharge with remote monitoring for 24 hours after ICD implant. Implants were performed via cephalic vein access, and randomization occurred after 4‐hours clinical observation and device interrogation. All patients were followed for a minimum of 6 weeks to assess acute procedural complications. RESULTS: 71 patients comprised the study cohort (mean age 62, 79% male) after 3 were excluded. The most common indication for ICD implant was ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction ≤35%. Device data obtained through 24‐hour remote monitoring was comparable to 4‐hour postimplant parameters in same‐day discharge patients. No acute complications occurred in same‐day discharge patients; 1 next‐day discharge patient developed pneumothorax. CONCLUSION: ICD implantation with same‐day discharge is reasonable in patients at low risk for complications. Remote monitoring can be useful in indicating lead‐parameter stability during the immediate postoperative period.

AB: We plan to conduct a randomized pilot trial evaluating the feasibility and promise of computerized CBT as a single module targeting risky sexual behavior in a HIV/Hepatitis C virus(HCV) high risk population. In the context of a drug treatment program, we will randomize 60 methadone maintenance patients to either standard treatment as usual at the program (TAU) or TAU plus the HIV/HCV/STD risk reduction module of CBT4CBT("Stay Safe"). Participants will be assessed at baseline, one month and three month time points. The primary outcome measures will be knowledge regarding risk of infection and transmission of HIV/HCV/STD,self report assessment of risky sexual practices, retention in the study and client satisfaction with the module. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. To determine the feasibility of integrating CBT4CBT/"Stay Safe" into this setting. Feasibility will be determined by completion of assessments at 1 and 3 month time points (retention) and satisfaction ratings by participants randomized to the computer module. 2. Compare knowledge of HIV/HCV/STD transmission and its prevention before and after intervention. This will be assessed by percent correct answers on a quiz administered at each assessment. 3. To evaluate changes in drug and sex risk behaviors by treatment. The primary outcome measure will be number of unprotected sexual encounters on self‐assessment instruments for risky sexual behaviors. We hypothesize that the single session of computer‐based CBT will result in reduced risky sexual behaviors and increased knowledge of HIV/HCV/STD transmission with differences in retention by intervention. A successful outcome for this pilot project would result in an effect size of 0.30 or more on outcomes of risk behavior. This intervention will be compared to treatment as usual at the participating site, which currently consists of two group educational sessions on safety regarding risks of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis. Preliminary Data‐ The case for computer‐based behavioral treatments Computer‐assisted therapies offer a relatively novel approach to the dissemination of Evidence Based Therapies (EBT) for behavioral interventions. Existing evidence points to their efficacy and cost‐effectiveness. Computer‐based interventions offer a number of attractive characteristics for use in primary care and substance treatment settings. Their low cost coupled with high consistency, accessibility and standardization are some associated advantages. Ease of implementation will be critical to reaching patients in remote and rural areas or in small medical offices as primary care providers become a mainstay of substance abuse treatment. Risky sexual behaviors can be targeted without the potential negative associations of face to face behavioral interventions for this highly sensitive domain and thus may be ideally modulated with computer‐based therapies. Equivalency to counselor‐based education for learning new health behaviors, cost‐effectiveness, patient satisfaction and accessibility for illiterate patients are other advantages shown with computer‐based therapy. Computer‐based CBT: Carroll et al. at Yale have developed an effective computer‐based version of CBT, called "CBT4CBT" and have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing drug use and building coping skills.(38) The program makes extensive use of 'movies' as teaching tools: In each module, the user watches an individual confront a difficult situation relevant to that module's topic; after teaching the key skill through a variety of strategies, the 'movie' repeats but has a different ending because the characters implement the targeted coping skills. In developing CBT4CBT, we sought to develop an engaging version of CBT that could take advantage of the capacity of computer‐based learning to convey information via a wide range of media (e.g., text, video, graphics, audio instruction, interactive exercises). The CBT4CBT program is highly user‐friendly, requiring no previous experience with computers and minimal use of text‐based material (i.e., minimal reading is required), and is highly interactive. In particular, we capitalize on the use of videotaped examples to allow users to actually see examples of individuals utilizing skills and strategies in a range of realistic situations. Viewers are able to watch real‐life challenges acted out and safe behaviors modeled, while addressing negative or detrimental thought processes that predispose to unhealthy or risky behavior choices (e.g. making a decision to have sex without a condom). Viewer knowledge base is targeted by didactic portions and role playing is modeled by the actors. The module includes the opportunity for the client to print out and perform 'homework' worksheets, shown to be predictive for successful outcomes in CBT. The module allows for considerable control by the viewer, who can choose the speed of progression through the screens and has the capability to go back to previous screens for reviewing. Single CBT module application: Our original feasibility, efficacy, durability and cost‐effectiveness studies for addictions treatment employed the full version of CBT4CBT, comprised of 7 modules. One independent module focuses entirely on targeting risky sexual and drug use practices (titled "Stay Safe"), but has not been evaluated as an independent module for effects on risk reduction. The "Stay Safe" module was developed by Dr. Kathleen Carroll and her team at Yale in consultation with the Connecticut AIDS Education and Training Center director (Karina Danvers) and others. Its development involved the input of the CBT experts (Dr. Carroll, Dr. Michael Copenhaver), infectious disease specialists and substance abuse treatment patients who volunteered to review the module. Like the substance abuse targeted sections, the script was written to be easily recognizable across many socioeconomic and cultural groups. Professional actors were hired to play the parts of substance users in two separate high risk situations, one sexual and one Intravenous drug use (IDU). Skills are taught with multimedia presentation allowing the user to direct the pace of the module, as well as to view the consequences of various choices during the risky situation. The intervention for the proposed pilot study is this single targeted module, "Stay Safe". The module can be completed on virtually any computer, and thus is ideal for implementation in this, and a wide range of settings. Its expense for clinical use will also be reduced as a result of its brevity. These characteristics will make it easily disseminated, with "real world" applications for settings of substance use treatment and primary care medicine. Overview: In order to maximize scientific yield from this project, we intentionally designed the study to parallel the landmark Calsyn(5) and Tross(6) randomized trials evaluating effects of the 5‐session group CDC behavioral approach for risky sex practices reduction in substance abuse treatment programs. We seek to compare as closely as possible the variable of therapy type (computerized CBT in our study versus group therapy for safer sex skills building in theirs), so we sought to minimize the differences between outcome measures and methods. Use of parallels in design and outcome measures will allow us to 'benchmark' outcomes to reported changes in those studies. Study Population and Sample: Hartford Dispensary (Hartford, CT) will serve as the site. Drug treatment and medical services are offered on an outpatient basis there. This study will enroll clients undergoing IDU treatment with methadone at the site. These clients come in regularly for scheduled maintenance medication and clinical monitoring as well as standard counseling. Many (roughly 55%) of these patients are already HCV and/or HIV positive and therefore pose a significant risk for the transmission of the virus through routes other than IDU. Recruitment: Clients will be identified through self‐presentation response to advertisements and fliers in the clinic. Drug counseling providers may also ask clients if they are interested in participating in the study. A sample size of 60 (30 patients per group) is feasible and would be sufficient to detect a large effect size on risky sexual behavior of [Cohen's d= 0.3, (alpha.05, power0.8)]. This effect size is smaller than that reported for behavioral studies in the literature, but should be sufficient to evaluate feasibility and promise of the proposed intervention in this pilot.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of a multi‐modal, remote monitoring intervention on medication adherence of patients previously nonadherent to therapy (proportion of days covered (PDC) < 80%) according to Independence Blue Cross claims data. METHODS: Patients with ongoing care at Penn Medicine, taking 4+ chronic oral medications, and established nonadherence to lipid lowering, anti‐hypertensive, or oral diabetes therapies were invited to participate in the randomized controlled trial. Consenting patients were randomized to treatment or control arms and observed for 6 months. Patients in the treatment group received a commercially available service that includes 1) aligning the patient's medication regimen into weekly multi‐dose blister packages that insert into 2) a remote monitoring pillbox that alerts the patient with lights, sounds, phone, or text message reminders when a dose is missed and 3) relays adherence information to study staff for outreach if < 80% of doses are taken for three consecutive days. Patients in the control group received usual care without reminders or outreach. RESULTS: Treatment (N=17) and control (N=33) groups were well‐matched for demographics and adherence prior to randomization. In the 12 months prior to index date, the treatment group had an average PDC of 70.4% vs. 69.5% for the control group. All patients in the treatment group moved from non‐adherent (PDC< 80%) in the prior period to adherent in the treatment period across all drug classes of interest with number of on‐time refills moving to 98%. At 6 months, treatment patients had higher rates of therapy persistence at 91.3% remaining persistent at 6 months vs 61.8% for control (Log‐rank p< 0.05). Potential covariates age, gender, education level, and race were not statistically significant in predicting early therapy termination. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on the intervention demonstrated significant and sustained improvements in medication adherence. Further testing should be done to determine the effectiveness of the approach on clinical outcomes and cost related measures.

AB: Objectives To improve access to contraceptives in remote and rural areas, sub‐Saharan African countries are allowing community health workers (CHWs) to distribute hormonal contraceptives. Before offering hormonal contraceptives, CHWs must determine pregnancy status but often lack a reliable way to do so. No studies have evaluated the impact of providing CHWs with urine pregnancy test kits. We assessed the impact of giving CHWs free pregnancy test kits on the number of new clients purchasing hormonal contraceptives from CHWs. Study design We implemented a randomized experiment in Eastern Madagascar among CHWs who sell injectable and oral hormonal contraceptives. A total of 622 CHWs were stratified by region and randomly assigned at the individual level. Treatment‐group CHWs were given free pregnancy tests to distribute (n analyzed=272) and control‐group CHWs did not receive the tests (n analyzed=263). We estimated an ordinary least‐squares regression model, with the monthly number of new hormonal contraceptive clients per CHW as our primary outcome. Results We find that providing CHWs with free pregnancy test kits increases the number of new hormonal contraceptive clients. Treatment‐group CHWs provide hormonal contraceptives to 3.1 new clients per month, compared to 2.5 in the control group. This difference of 0.7 clients per month (95% confidence interval 0.13‐1.18; p=.014) represents a 26% increase. Conclusions Giving CHWs free pregnancy tests is an effective way to increase distribution of hormonal contraceptives. As pregnancy tests become increasingly affordable for health‐care systems in developing countries, community‐based distribution programs should consider including the tests as a low‐cost addition to CHWs' services. Implications No study has evaluated the impact of giving CHWs free urine pregnancy test kits for distribution to improve provision of hormonal contraceptives. Giving CHWs free pregnancy test kits significantly increases the number of clients to whom they sell hormonal contraceptives. Community‐based distribution programs should consider including these tests among CHWs' services.

AB: Background: eHealth systems are being rapidly diffused and used by health organizations, healthcare providers and patients for diabetes educational purposes because of perceived cost savings, convenience and access from remote locations. Objective: To compare the use of 3 education systems that varied media (face‐to‐face vs. electronic), communication (e.g. synchronous and asynchronous) and information processing functionality (e.g. Internet searching, view laboratory blood test results) for education of newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Design/Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, changes in glycated hemoglobin (A1C), self‐efficacy and diabetes knowledge were compared between 3 models of education and communication support in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes: controls (face‐to‐face education, synchronous and asynchronous communication), Web Static (electronic education and virtual appointments using asynchronous communication) and Web Interactive (electronic education and virtual appointments using both synchronous and asynchronous communication). Results: In an intent‐to‐treat analysis, all 3 groups had similar improvement in diabetes knowledge, selfefficacy and diabetes self‐care activities. Independent of which group subjects were randomized to, findings were significant when examining correlation between website usage and outcomes: a higher total use was associated with a higher diabetes knowledge score (r=0.265, p=0.029), a higher total diabetes self‐efficacy by final study visit (r=0.317, p=0.008) and a lower A1C by final study visit (r=‐0.271, p=0.026) by the last visit. Conclusions: Initial diabetes education can be delivered successfully through electronic media. Higher adoption of electronic media is associated with improved clinical outcomes. © 2012 Canadian Diabetes Association.

AB: Background: Smartphones provide a low‐cost and efficient means to collect population level data. Several small studies have shown promise in predicting mood variability from smartphone‐based sensor and usage data, but have not been generalized to nationally recruited samples. This study used passive smartphone data, demographic characteristics, and baseline depressive symptoms to predict prospective daily mood. Method: Daily phone usage data were collected passively from 271 Android phone users participating in a fully remote randomized controlled trial of depression treatment (BRIGHTEN). Participants completed daily Patient Health Questionnaire‐2. A machine learning approach was used to predict daily mood for the entire sample and individual participants. Results: Sample‐wide estimates showed a marginally significant association between physical mobility and self‐reported daily mood (B = –0.04, P < 0.05), but the predictive models performed poorly for the sample as a whole (median R2 ∼ 0). Focusing on individuals, 13.9% of participants showed significant association (FDR < 0.10) between a passive feature and daily mood. Personalized models combining features provided better prediction performance (median area under the curve [AUC] > 0.50) for 80.6% of participants and very strong prediction in a subset (median AUC > 0.80) for 11.8% of participants. Conclusions: Passive smartphone data with current features may not be suited for predicting daily mood at a population level because of the high degree of intra‐ and interindividual variation in phone usage patterns and daily mood ratings. Personalized models show encouraging early signs for predicting an individual's mood state changes, with GPS‐derived mobility being the top most important feature in the present sample.

AB: Objective To report the 6‐year results of the Stanford University Network for Diagnosis of Retinopathy of Prematurity (SUNDROP) initiative in the context of telemedicine screening initiatives for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Design A retrospective analysis. Participants Premature newborns requiring ROP screening at 6 neonatal intensive care units from December 1, 2005, to November 30, 2011. Methods Infants were evaluated via remote retinal photography by an ROP specialist. A total of 608 preterm infants meeting ROP examination criteria were screened with the RetCam II/III (Clarity Medical Systems, Pleasanton, Calif.). Primary outcomes were treatment‐warranted ROP (TW‐ROP) and adverse anatomical events. Results During the 6 years, 1216 total eyes were screened during 2169 examinations, generating 26 970 retinal images, an average of 3.56 examinations and 44.28 images per patient. Twenty‐two (3.6%) of the infants screened met criteria for TW‐ROP. Compared with bedside binocular ophthalmoscopy, remote interpretation of RetCam II/III images had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 99.8%, positive predicative value of 95.5%, and negative predicative value of 100% for the detection of TW‐ROP. No adverse anatomical outcomes were observed for any enrolled patient. Conclusions The 6‐year results for the SUNDROP telemedicine initiative were highly favourable with respect to diagnostic accuracy. Telemedicine appears to be a safe, reliable, and cost‐effective complement to the efforts of ROP specialists, capable of increasing patient access to screening and focusing the resources of the current ophthalmic community on infants with potentially vision‐threatening disease.

AB: Objectives Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), using brief cycles of limb ischaemia/reperfusion, is a non‐invasive, low‐cost intervention that may reduce perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We investigated whether RIPC can also improve short‐term clinical outcomes. Methods One hundred and eighty patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and/ or valve surgery were randomised to receive either RIPC (2‐5 min cycles of simultaneous upper arm and thigh cuff inflation/deflation; N=90) or control (uninflated cuffs placed on the upper arm and thigh; N=90). The study primary end point was PMI, measured by 72 h area under the curve (AUC) serum high‐sensitive troponin‐T (hsTnT); secondary end point included short‐term clinical outcomes. Results RIPC reduced PMI magnitude by 26% (‐9.303 difference (CI ‐ 15.618 to ‐ 2.987) 72 h hsTnT‐AUC; p=0.003) compared with control. There was also evidence that RIPC reduced the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation by 54% (11% RIPC vs 24% control; p=0.031) and decreased the incidence of acute kidney injury by 48% (10.0% RIPC vs 21.0% control; p=0.063), and intensive care unit stay by 1 day (2.0 days RIPC (CI 1.0 to 4.0) vs 3.0 days control (CI 2.0 to 4.5); p=0.043). In a post hoc analysis, we found that control patients administered intravenous glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) intraoperatively sustained 39% less PMI compared with those not receiving GTN, and RIPC did not appear to reduce PMI in patients given GTN. Conclusions RIPC reduced the extent of PMI in patients undergoing CABG and/or valve surgery. RIPC may also have beneficial effects on short‐term clinical outcomes, although this will need to be confirmed in future studies. Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00397163.

AB: Purpose: To determine the feasibility of using a portable, low‐cost tablet device in a home setting to detect changes of central retinal sensitivity in agerelated macular degeneration (AMD). Method: Cases of bilateral intermediate AMD, involved in a longitudinal study were enrolled into the home monitoring project. Our customized tablet application (PsyPad) measures the central retinal sensitivity (within the central 2° radius). Participants were asked to perform the test at least once a week at home, with half the participants randomized to receive weekly text reminders. The participants' engagement and results with the test were remotely stored and analysed. Results: Thirty participants aged 70.7 ± 7.5 years with intermediate AMD are enrolled in the study, with fourteen receiving weekly reminders. Currently, eight participants have been in the study for more than 6 weeks with 156 tests between them. The reminder group performed the test every 5.9 ± 3.8 days compared with 8.4 ± 3.5 days in the group without reminders (p = 0.007). The mean test duration per eye was 99.4 ± 10.5 seconds. The coefficient of repeatability of mean central retinal sensitivity between participant's last two tests was ± 4.13 dB. Conclusion: This pilot study found that elderly individuals were compliant to regularly test their eyes using PsyPad in a home setting. The weekly reminders assisted in maintaining routine testing. This study highlights the potential for using home based, digital methods, with remote surveillance for monitoring visual function in people at high risk of vision loss from AMD.

AB: Introduction Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) has emerged as a non‐invasive, low‐cost therapeutic intervention for reducing peri‐operative myocardial injury (PMI) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or valve surgery. However, some studies have been neutral, suggesting that the standard single limb RIPC stimulus may be ineffective under certain conditions. We investigated the effect of increasing the strength of the RIPC stimulus in patients undergoing elective cardiac bypass surgery. Methods and results 180 consecutive patients undergoing elective CABG and/or valve surgery were randomised to receive either RIPC (2‐5 min cycles of simultaneous upper arm and thigh cuff inflation and deflation, N=90) or control (uninflated cuffs placed on the upper arm and thigh for 20 min, N=90). Patients randomised to RIPC had less PMI (26% reduction in 72 h area‐under‐the‐curve high‐sensitivity Troponin T; p=0.003), reduced incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF, 11% RIPC vs 24% control; p=0.031), decreased the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI, 7% RIPC vs 17% control; p=0.036), and shortened the stay on the intensive care unit (ICU, 2 days RIPC vs 3 days control; p=0.043). Interestingly, we found that in those patients who received IV GTN during surgery sustained less PMI, and RIPC was ineffective. Conclusions Multi‐limb RIPC induced by simultaneous upper arm and leg cuff inflation reduced PMI, decreased the incidence of postoperative AF, reduced the incidence of AKI and shortened the ITU stay, in patients undergoing CABG and/or valve surgery.

KY: Cerebral Infarction; Ischemia; Stroke
AB: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and the main cause of incapacity. Currently, the only therapies for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients are the administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt‐PA) and/or endovascular treatment. Unfortunately, many patients cannot benefit from these therapies due to contraindications or evolution time. Neuroprotective therapies could not only increase the benefits of available reperfusion therapies but also provide an option for patients who are not candidates for these treatments. Remote ischemic conditioning, consisting on brief episodes of transient limb ischemia, represents a new paradigm in neuroprotection. It can be categorized in pre‐, per‐ or postconditioning, depending on the moment of application. According to studies in coronary ischemia, remote ischemic perconditioning (RIPerC) during the ischemic event is safe, cost‐effective, feasible and associated with a reduction in myocardial injury. The investigators aim to conduct a multicentre study (5 university hospitals) of pre‐hospital RIPerC in AIS patients (within 8 hours of stroke onset), which would include 572 stroke code activated patients (286 would undergo RIPerC and 286 would be sham). Our hypothesis is that RIPerC would be safe and would induce endogenous neuroprotective phenomena associated with good outcomes in AIS patients whether treated with revascularization therapies or not. Moreover, the development of systemic ischemic tolerance should provide metabolomic and lipidomic signatures that would present an opportunity to find specific molecular markers (biomarkers). The main objectives will be to assess: 1) RIPerC clinical benefits in AIS, 2) whether RIPerC is safe not only in AIS but also in all cases of stroke code activation, 3) whether RIPerC is associated with a reduction in cerebral infarct size and 4) metabolomic and lipidomic signatures of the RIPerC effect.

AB: This is a single‐center, prospective, randomized, 'open‐label,' investigator initiated pilot study evaluating the role of mobile technology to improve diabetes care in adults with type 1 diabetes (REMOTE‐T1D). We hypothesize that the use of mobile technology (iBGStar® technology [iPhone® plus the BGStar®]) will result in improvement in Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO), and Treatment Satisfactions with a possible reductions of glucose excursions, A1c, and severe hypoglycemia as compared to routine clinical care using traditional glucose meter SMBG‐Accu‐chek®. This study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of these technologies in a clinical setting with a hope to improve outcomes and health care cost savings. The study will enroll 100 patients from the Barbara Davis Center Adult clinic over the age of 18 years who will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to intervention group using mobile technology (iBG Star) vs. continued routine clinical care (control) using SMBG‐Accu‐chek meter. All subjects will be followed for study visits with similar frequency at baseline, 1‐week, 1‐month, 3‐months, and 6‐months and wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) using a DexCom SEVEN Plus® system in a blinded mode for 7 days at baseline (wk0), 1mo, 3mo, and 6mo. Laboratory analysis for A1c will be performed at baseline, 1‐month 3‐months, and 6‐months. Routine blood tests will be performed in all subjects at baseline, 3months, and 6‐months. Blinded CGM data will be analyzed for mean blood glucose values, time spent in hyperglycemic (>240, >300mg/dl) and hypoglycemic (<50, <70, <80 mg/dl) ranges and various indices of glycemic variability.

AB: Background: Resistance to change is comprised in the behavioural phenotypes of Prader‐Willi (PWS) fragile X (FXS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and often precipitates temper outbursts. Pilot work shows that signalling changes using a distinctive cue card to individuals with PWS can reduce the disruptive behavioural response following specific changes. Here, change signalling or visual scheduling to avoid change were implemented by caregivers following web‐based training and compared in a randomised controlled trial. Methods: The caregivers of 122 children (8‐16 years) with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, recruited via support groups and research databases, expressed an interest in participating. Of these, 60 were willing and eligible to participate based on their child evidencing temper outbursts following changes. Blended face‐to‐face and remote focus groups of parents and professionals allowed the collaborative design of a web‐based temper outburst diary and caregiver training on the two intervention strategies. Semi‐structured interview and/or questionnaire measures assessed temper outbursts and cost to services before baseline; following a 6 M baseline; and 6 M following training being made available. The diary was available throughout and included intervention process information. Following baseline, 36 families were allocated to change signalling or planning ahead using randomised minimisation (balancing frequency of temper outbursts, diary usage, adaptive behaviour and diagnosis). At the end of the study, semistructured interviews were conducted with all available caregivers on intervention process. Results: Engagement with training resources, perceived success in applying the allocated strategy and changes in reported temper outbursts, varied extensively across caregivers. And individual variability was greater than group difference. Conclusion: There is potential to intervene with specific aspects of behavioural phenotypes via careful measurement and targeting of individuals for whom that aspect is a particular problem. However, there is a need for an individualised approach to providing caregivers with the strategies most likely to be effective for their child.

AB: Purpose: Despite the increasing use of pre‐ and posthydration protocols and low‐osmolar iodine‐containing contrast media, the incidence of contrast‐induced nephropathy (CIN) is still significant. There is evidence that contrast media cause ischemia reperfusion injury of the renal medulla. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a noninvasive, safe, and low‐cost method to reduce ischemia‐ reperfusion injury. The aim of this study is to investigate whether RIPC, as an adjunct to standard preventive measures, reduces CI‐AKI. Material and Methods: The RIPCIN study is a multicenter, single‐ blinded, RCT in which 76 patients at risk of CIN received standard hydration combined with RIPC or hydration with sham preconditioning. RIPC was applied by four cycles of 5‐min ischemia and 5‐min reperfusion of the forearm. The primary outcome measure was the change in serum creatinine from baseline to 48 to 72 hours after contrast administration. Results: With regard to the primary endpoint, no significant effect of RIPC was found. CIN occurred in 4 patients (2 sham and 2 RIPC). A pre‐defined subgroup analysis of patients with a Mehran risk score ≥ 11, showed a significantly reduced change in serum creatinine from baseline to 48 to 72 hours in patients allocated to the RIPC group (Δcreatinine ‐3.3±9.8 μmol/L) as compared to the sham group (Δcreatinine +17.8±20.1 μmol/L). Conclusion: RIPC, as an adjunct to standard preventive measures, does not improve serum creatinine levels after contrast administration in patients at risk of CIN. Our data indicate that RIPC might have beneficial effects in patients with a high or very high risk of CIN (Mehran risk score ≥ 11).

AB: BACKGROUND: Novel cardioprotective strategies are required to improve clinical outcomes in high risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) ± valve surgery. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIC), in which brief episodes of non‐lethal ischemia and reperfusion are applied to the arm or leg, has been demonstrated to reduce perioperative myocardial injury following CABG ± valve surgery. Whether RIC can improve clinical outcomes in this setting is unknown and is investigated in the effect of remote ischemic preconditioning on clinical outcomes (ERICCA) trial in patients undergoing CABG surgery. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01247545). METHODS: The ERICCA trial is a multicentre randomized double‐blinded controlled clinical trial which will recruit 1,610 high‐risk patients (Additive Euroscore ≥ 5) undergoing CABG ± valve surgery using blood cardioplegia via 27 tertiary centres over 2 years. The primary combined endpoint will be cardiovascular death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization and stroke at 1 year. Secondary endpoints will include peri‐operative myocardial and acute kidney injury, intensive care unit and hospital stay, inotrope score, left ventricular ejection fraction, changes of quality of life and exercise tolerance. Patients will be randomized to receive after induction of anesthesia either RIC (4 cycles of 5 min inflation to 200 mmHg and 5 min deflation of a blood pressure cuff placed on the upper arm) or sham RIC (4 cycles of simulated inflations and deflations of the blood pressure cuff). IMPLICATIONS: The findings from the ERICCA trial have the potential to demonstrate that RIC, a simple, non‐invasive and virtually cost‐free intervention, can improve clinical outcomes in higher‐risk patients undergoing CABG ± valve surgery.

AB: This study involves prospective data collection from an intervention to investigate the impact of participation by MS patients in a 12‐week guided online social support group. All outcomes will be compared to active control group. At the completion of a 12‐week interval, all participants (placebo and treatment) will complete follow‐up questionnaires. Three months after completing, participants will be sent follow‐up questionnaires that will be evaluated as a 6‐month follow‐up, to assess retention of benefits. Social support has been linked to better health outcomes in many clinical populations. Multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic neurological disease that affects over 400,000 people in the United States, involves physical and cognitive disability that can have negative consequences on social integration. This can lead to social isolation, which may be dynamically related to depression, fatigue, and disease progression. The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of support group involvement on persons with MS. Outcomes of interest include mood, loneliness, and quality of life (QOL). Many people with MS feel isolated and are unable to participate in support groups that meet in locations that may be far from home, difficult to travel to (due to physical disability or lack of resources), or may not be convenient for their schedules. Another hindrance is the apprehension that MS patients sometimes experience when they encounter patients with severe physical disability, or worse impairment than their own. For these reasons, the study is introducing remote support groups to be conducted via the internet, "e‐Support." Attending a remote, internet based support group may be more appealing to patients with MS as it obviates the need to travel, thereby reducing cost, time, and energy.

AB: BACKGROUND: Bivalirudin (Angiomax) is a direct thrombin inhibitor used in interventional cardiology due to its several distinct advantages over heparin, most notably a shorter half‐life and a potentially superior safety profile. Bivalirudin is also safe to use in patients with active or remote heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia. Our objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of high‐intensity anticoagulation using bivalirudin during neuroendovascular procedures. METHODS: The bivalirudin dosing regimens reported in the cardiac literature were modified empirically for two different activated clotting time (ACT) target ranges. The low‐dose protocol (ACT of 250 to 300 s) was used for embolization procedures and the high‐dose protocol (ACT of 300‐350) was employed for angioplasty and stent placement. The bivalirudin treated patients were matched for age, gender, and type of procedure with a random sample of patients who underwent neuroendovascular procedures with the standardized heparin protocol. The thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications were compared between the two groups and bleeding complications were categorized as major (hemorrhage that was intra‐cerebral or resulted in Hb decrease ≥ 5 g/dl), minor, or insignificant. RESULTS: Bivalirudin was used in 30 patients with high‐dose and low‐dose bivalirudin protocols used in 26 and 4 patients, respectively. These were compared to the 60 control patients who received heparin. There were no bleeding or thromboembolic complications in the bivalirudin treated patients; however one patient reported a transient headache. In patients treated with heparin, one bleeding complication of a groin hematoma was reported. Also one patient was found to have left‐arm weakness following the procedure which was attributed to a new small middle cerebral artery ischemic event. CONCLUSIONS: Our data supports that bivalirudin usage is likely a safe alternative to heparin for high‐intensity anticoagulation in neuroendovascular procedures. Further studies are required for more definitive comparisons for efficacy and cost‐effectiveness between the two agents.

AB: Objectives: In Ireland, as elsewhere, GPs and practice nurses play a key role in cervical cancer prevention. As well as providing services via a national screening programme, they provide advice about human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, testing and vaccination. Thus, their knowledge and practices in these areas have a major influence on the success of cervical cancer prevention in Ireland. ATHENS (A Trial of HPV Education and Support) aims to (1) develop practical resource(s) to support health professionals in this area; and (2) test the efficacy of these resources in improving knowledge and influencing clinical practice. Methods: Resource(s) will be developed through primary research based on theories of behaviour change. In‐depth semi‐structured telephone interviews have been conducted amongst 19 GPs and 14 practice nurses. Analysis has identified key clinical practices/behaviours that the resources will seek to influence, and associated barriers or facilitators for these behaviours. A nationwide quantitative survey will now be conducted to identify the frequency and distribution of these key behaviours and the modifiable determinants which predict these behaviours. A randomised controlled trial will then be undertaken to test the efficacy of the resource(s). Results: Analysis has revealed that male GPs are moving away from the role of smear taker. HPV infection is not widely discussed with patients. Reasons cited include their own lack of knowledge, avoidance of the topic, unwillingness to embarrass patients, and uncertainty about how to tackle the subject. Cost emerged as a major barrier to conducting HPV vaccination in general practice. Professionals' awareness of HPV testing is limited and there is considerable uncertainty regarding its clinical benefit and role in management. Conclusions: As well as facilitating best practice in relation to cervical cancer prevention, ATHENS will help to ensure that women receive the most up‐to‐date information and appropriate advice.

AB: BACKGROUND: Patient adherence to appointments is key to improving outcomes in health care. "No‐show" appointments contribute to suboptimal resource use. Patient navigation and telephone reminders have been shown to improve cancer care and adherence, particularly in disadvantaged populations, but may not be cost‐effective if not targeted at the appropriate patients. METHODS: In 5 clinics within a large academic cancer center, patients who were considered to be likely (the top 20th percentile) to miss a scheduled appointment without contacting the clinic ahead of time ("no‐shows") were identified using a predictive model and then randomized to an intervention versus a usual‐care group. The intervention group received telephone calls from a bilingual patient navigator 7 days before and 1 day before the appointment. RESULTS: Over a 5‐month period, of the 40,075 appointments scheduled, 4425 patient appointments were deemed to be at high risk of a "no‐show" event. After the patient navigation intervention, the no‐show rate in the intervention group was 10.2% (167 of 1631), compared with 17.5% in the control group (280 of 1603) (P<.001). Reaching a patient or family member was associated with a significantly lower no‐show rate (5.9% and 3.0%, respectively; P<.001 and .006, respectively) compared with leaving a message (14.7%: P = .117) or no contact (no‐show rate, 21.6%: P = .857). CONCLUSIONS: Telephone navigation targeted at those patients predicted to be at high risk of visit nonadherence was found to effectively and substantially improve patient adherence to cancer clinic appointments. Further studies are needed to determine the long‐term impact on patient outcomes, but short‐term gains in the optimization of resources can be recognized immediately.

AB: BACKGROUND: Secondary prevention by risk factor modification improves patient outcomes, yet it is often not achieved in clinical practice. Reasons for failure stem from challenges of prioritizing risk factor reduction and engaging patients in changing their behaviors. We hypothesize that a novel telemedicine intervention with tailored patient education could improve cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: To evaluate this intervention, we propose enrolling 450 patients with a recent myocardial infarction and hypertension into a 3‐arm randomized, controlled trial. The first arm (n=150) will receive home blood pressure (BP) monitors plus a nurse‐delivered, telephone‐based tailored patient education intervention and will be enrolled into HealthVault, a Microsoft electronic health record platform. The second arm (n=150) will also receive BP monitors plus a tailored patient education intervention and be enrolled in HeartVault. However, the patient education intervention will be delivered by a Web‐based program and will cover topics identical to those in the nurse‐delivered intervention. Both arms will be compared with a control group receiving standard care (n=150). All participants will have an in‐person assessment at baseline and at completion of the study, including standardized measurements of BP, LDL cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin (in diabetic subjects). The study design will allow assessment of a telephone‐based, nurse‐administered disease management program versus standard care. The main outcome of interest is the reduction in systolic BP in each intervention group compared with the control group at 12 months. Secondary outcomes assessed will include reductions in LDL cholesterol, body weight, and glycosylated hemoglobin, as well as adherence to evidence‐based therapies and improvement in health behaviors. CONCLUSION: If successful in optimizing BP control, managing other coronary heart disease risk factors, and demonstrating a lower cost, the Web‐based disease management tool has the potential to enhance coronary artery disease management, quality of care, and ultimately, patient outcomes.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Child pedestrian injury is a global public health challenge. This randomized, controlled trial considered comparative efficacy of individualized streetside training, training in a virtual pedestrian environment, training using videos and Web sites, plus no‐training control, to improve children's street‐crossing ability. METHODS: Pedestrian safety was evaluated among 231 7‐ and 8‐year‐olds using both streetside (field) and laboratory‐based (virtual environment) trials before intervention group assignment, immediately posttraining, and 6 months posttraining. All training groups received 6 30‐min sessions. Four outcomes assessed pedestrian safety: start delay (temporal lag before initiating crossing), hits/close calls (collisions/near‐misses with vehicles in simulated crossings), attention to traffic (looks left and right, controlled for time), and missed opportunities (safe crossing opportunities that were missed). RESULTS: Results showed training in the virtual pedestrian environment and especially individualized streetside training resulted in safer pedestrian behavior postintervention and at follow‐up. As examples, children trained streetside entered safe traffic gaps more quickly posttraining than control group children and children trained streetside or in the virtual environment had somewhat fewer hits/close calls in postintervention VR trials. Children showed minimal change in attention to traffic posttraining. Children trained with videos/websites showed minimal learning. CONCLUSION: Both individualized streetside training and training within virtual pedestrian environments may improve 7‐ and 8‐year‐olds' street‐crossing safety. Individualized training has limitations of adult time and labor. Virtual environment training has limitations of accessibility and cost. Given the public health burden of child pedestrian injuries, future research should explore innovative strategies for effective training that can be broadly disseminated.

AB: BACKGROUND: Text‐message and e‐mail are emerging as potential methods for improving weight outcomes among obese individuals. The optimal volume, frequency, and timing of such interventions are unknown. This study investigated the effect of adjunct technological support on weight and psychological variables after a 3‐month cognitive‐behaviour therapy (CBT) group intervention. METHODS: Sixty obese adults were randomised to a CBT programme plus intensive (text‐message and e‐mail; CBT+ITS) or minimal (text‐message only; CBT+MTS) technological support. Assessments occurred at baseline, 3‐, 6‐, 9‐, and 15‐months. Outcome variables included weight (kg), body mass index (kg/m2), waist circumference (cm), binge‐eating tendencies, weight self‐efficacy, and weight control cognitions and behaviours. RESULTS: CBT+ITS (n=31) and CBT+MTS (n=29) participants lost 5.2% (±1.1) and 4.7% (±1.1) of their baseline weight by 3‐months, 8.4% (±1.2) and 6.4% (±1.1) by 6‐months, 9.6% (±1.3) and 6.4% (±1.3) by 9‐months, and sustained a 7.5% (±1.3) and 5.1% (±1.3) loss at 15‐months, respectively. There were no significant differences between intensive and minimal support, however, the CBT+ITS group showed a marginal advantage across all anthropometric measures. CONCLUSIONS: A low intensity text‐message support programme is just as effective as higher intensity technological support for maintaining weight loss in obese adults. This represents a low‐cost means of aiding weight loss maintenance without reliance on extended face‐to‐face treatment.

AB: BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence and associated cost of treating Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is unsustainable, and focus is needed on self‐management and prevention of hospital admissions. Telehealth monitoring of patients' vital signs allows clinicians to prioritise their workload and enables patients to take more responsibility for their health. This paper reports the results of a qualitative study embedded within a feasibility and pilot Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) of Telehealth‐supported care within a community‐based COPD supported‐discharge service. The aim of the study was to qualitatively explore the experiences of patients with COPD who had received either a Telehealth‐supported or a specialist nursing intervention following their discharge from hospital after an admission for a COPD exacerbation. METHODS: Patients were invited to either participate in semi‐structured interviews or to complete a semi‐structured self‐administered questionnaire on completion of the intervention. Nine patients were interviewed (67 % female) and seventeen patients completed the questionnaires. In addition, three clinicians responsible for the delivery of both interventions were interviewed to obtain their perspectives on the new services. RESULTS: Seven underlying themes emerged from the patient interviews and were further explored in the questionnaires: (1) patient demographics; (2) information received by the participants; (3) installation of the Telehealth technology; (4) Telehealth service functionality; (5) visits; (6) service withdrawal; and (7) service perceptions. Recipients of both services reported feelings of safety derived from the delivery of an integrated, community‐based service. CONCLUSIONS: Although recipients of the Telehealth service received 50 % fewer home visits from the clinicians than recipients of a more traditional community‐based nursing intervention, the patients were enthusiastic about the service, with some describing it as the best service they had ever received. This suggests that a Telehealth intervention is an acceptable alternative to a more traditional home nursing visit model for monitoring community‐based patients with COPD following their discharge from hospital.

AB: Background: Recent cognitive science advances now permit treatment development for schizophrenia that is guided by an understanding of underlying neural system impairments. Among these impairments, deficits in general cognition, social cognition, and motivated behavior are critical factors in long‐term outcome that have often not been addressed by conventional interventions. Methods: Automated cognitive training methods that target cognitive operations, socio‐affective processes, and motivation have been developed based on the basic science of learning, cortical plasticity, and reward and motivated behavior. We have recently integrated these methods with advances in interactive software development and innovations in mobile health platforms. We have initiated randomized trials in both first‐episode patients and in those with persistent illness that focus on: 1) The use of iPads and Facetime to perform remote assessments and cognitive training interventions to individuals in distant locations; 2) The development of a mobile app incorporating 1:1 remote coaching and social networking that is explicitly designed to harness intrinsic motivational processes to improve healthpromoting behavior in young people with schizophrenia. Results: Interim data indicate that it these methods show good acceptability, feasibility, and tolerability as well as strong patient adherance. Assessments performed remotely show acceptable reliability with those performed in person. On average, participants train for 2.5 hours per week. Mobile app users access the app an average of once per day, and require less than 15 minutes of direct coaching per day. They report goal achievement at 80%. They cite the social networking aspects as a particularly rewarding feature. Conclusion: Initial data indicate that these approaches show potential to increase cost‐effectiveness, accessibility, and scalability of interventions, while increasing autonomy, competence and social support. In addition, these approaches permit real‐time quantification of patients' symptoms, adherence, and progress, allowing for continuous dynamic customization of rehabilitation support and the delivery of true "personalized psychiatry".

AB: Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition that is widely underdiagnosed. In adults ranging from 30 to 70 years of age, it is estimated that the prevalence of OSA is 26 percent. Many patients are undiagnosed, and access to evaluation is limited due to geographic concerns and the paucity of sleep specialists. Telemedicine visits may allow for greater access to this care. Patient‐centered care and satisfaction surveys are an important way to better assess patient needs. Methods: Subjects ranging from 30‐70 years of age, with a variety of sleep concerns, were recruited from the University of Rochester sleep center as part of an inter‐rater reliability study. Subjects were evaluated in‐person and online. During the telemedicine encounter, a separate, randomized provider performed an independent evaluation for OSA via tele‐video conferencing with the subject. Following this encounter, subjects were given a link to an online survey to complete regarding their experience. Results: Of 50 subjects that were recruited to date, 28 (56%) successfully completed the telemedicine encounter and online survey. Of these patients, 82% had never before had a telemedicine encounter with a provider. However, 75% had communicated with their provider through a secure email program at some point and 32% did this routinely. The majority, 82%, of subjects felt comfortable conducting a new patient appointment for their sleep medicine concerns via telemedicine, and 75% thought telemedicine would make it easier to make their appointments. Only 7% of subjects surveyed would not be interested in having online appointments with their sleep medicine provider, and 64% would be interested if it were the same cost or even a little bit more than their current co‐pay. Conclusion: These results suggest that patients are comfortable with telemedicine appointments for evaluation of OSA, and find it convenient to make these appointments. Telemedicine may improve access for evaluation of OSA, without reducing patient satisfaction, especially if these appointments are financially comparable to an in‐person visit.

AB: Introduction Knee osteoarthritis is a major cause of disability among the middle to senior age groups. Despite being effective, office‐based physical therapy (OBPT) needs professional human resources and is both costly and time‐consuming. We aimed to compare the efficacy of tele‐rehabilitation (tele‐rehab) compared with OBPT in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods In this randomized clinical trial, patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee were assigned to participate in either a 6‐week home‐based tele‐rehab or an OBPT program between 2015 and 2016. Our primary outcome was the mean change from the baseline until 1 and 6 month's post‐intervention in scores of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). We used analysis of variance for the repeated measure statistical test. Results A total of 54 patients entered the final analysis, with 27 in each group. The mean age of the patients was 58.2 ± 7.41 years and 60.2% were female. In the tele‐rehab and OBPT group, KOOS scores increased from baseline to 6 months post‐intervention (50.6 to 83.1 and 49.8 to 81.8) respectively. There was no significant difference between tele‐rehab and OBPT groups in any of the studied scales. Discussion The tele‐rehab program is as effective as OBPT in improving the function of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Considering the much lower time and cost consumed by tele‐rehab, it is the recommended program for the older population living in remote sites.

AB: BACKGROUND: Computer‐tailored eHealth interventions to improve health behavior have been demonstrated to be effective and cost‐effective if they are used as recommended. However, different subgroups may use the Internet differently, which might also affect intervention use and effectiveness. To date, there is little research available depicting whether adherence to intervention recommendations differs according to personal characteristics. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to assess which personal characteristics are associated with using an eHealth intervention as recommended. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted among a sample of the adult Dutch population (N=1638) testing an intervention aimed at improving 5 healthy lifestyle behaviors: increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, increasing physical activity, reducing alcohol intake, and promoting smoking cessation. Participants were asked to participate in those specific online modules for which they did not meet the national guideline(s) for the respective behavior(s). Participants who started with fewer than the recommended number of modules of the intervention were defined as users who did not follow the intervention recommendation. RESULTS: The fewer modules recommended to participants, the better participants adhered to the intervention modules. Following the intervention recommendation increased when participants were older (chi(2)1=39.8, P<.001), female (chi(2)1=15.8, P<.001), unemployed (chi(2)1=7.9, P=.003), ill (chi(2)1=4.5, P=.02), or in a relationship (chi(2)1=7.8, P=.003). No significant relevant differences were found between groups with different levels of education, incomes, or quality of life. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that eHealth interventions were used differently by subgroups. The more frequent as‐recommended intervention use by unemployed, older, and ill participants may be an indication that these eHealth interventions are attractive to people with a greater need for health care information. Further research is necessary to make intervention use more attractive for people with unhealthy lifestyle patterns.

AB: Background/objectives Lifestyle modification is recommended as the primary intervention for metabolic syndrome (MetS). The study was to examine the effects of a lifestyle intervention program (LIP) on physical outcomes, depression, and quality of life (QoL) in Chinese adults with MetS. Methods A randomized control trial design was used. A three‐month LIP guided by the Health Promotion Model was developed, including a lifestyle modification booklet, one session of discharge education, and six telephone follow‐ups. Patients with MetS were recruited from the inpatient departments of a hospital and were randomized to receive either the LIP or usual care. The physical outcomes, depression (Depression subscale of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and QoL (Medical Outcome Study Short Form‐12, SF‐12) were measured at baseline, one‐month (T1) and three‐month (T2). The effects of the LIP were examined by the generalized estimating equation (GEE) model. Results The study recruited 173 participants, with 86 in the intervention group and 87 in the control. Continuous improvements were observed in all the study outcomes in the intervention group. The GEE model revealed significant improvements in body weight (T1: p = 0.017, T2: p = 0.007), body mass index (T1: p = 0.015, T2: p = 0.009), depression (T1: p = 0.027, T2: p < 0.001), and physical aspects of QoL at T2 (p = 0.02). Conclusions The current LIP was effective in losing body weight, improving depression and QoL of MetS populations in three‐month observation. Considering its low‐cost and convenience, the LIP could be applied in clinical practice to improve patient outcomes. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd

AB: BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation programs offer effective means to prevent recurrence of a cardiac event, but poor uptake of current programs have been reported globally. Home based models are considered as a feasible alternative to avoid various barriers related to care centre based programs. This paper sets out the study design for a clinical trial seeking to test the hypothesis that these programs can be better and more efficiently supported with novel Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). METHODS/DESIGN: We have integrated mobile phones and web services into a comprehensive home‐ based care model for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Mobile phones with a built‐in accelerometer sensor are used to measure physical exercise and WellnessDiary software is used to collect information on patients' physiological risk factors and other health information. Video and teleconferencing are used for mentoring sessions aiming at behavioural modifications through goal setting. The mentors use web‐portal to facilitate personal goal setting and to assess the progress of each patient in the program. Educational multimedia content are stored or transferred via messaging systems to the patients phone to be viewed on demand. We have designed a randomised controlled trial to compare the health outcomes and cost efficiency of the proposed model with a traditional community based rehabilitation program. The main outcome measure is adherence to physical exercise guidelines. DISCUSSION: The study will provide evidence on using mobile phones and web services for mentoring and self management in a home‐based care model targeting sustainable behavioural modifications in cardiac rehabilitation patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial has been registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) with number ACTRN12609000251224.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Persons with concomitant heart failure (HF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) have complicated, often competing, self‐care expectations and treatment regimens that may reduce quality of life (QOL). This randomized controlled trial tested an integrated self‐care intervention on outcomes of HF and DM QOL, physical function, and physical activity (PA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants with HF and DM (n = 134; mean age 57.4 ± 11 years, 66% men, 69% minority) were randomized to usual care (control) or intervention. The control group received standard HF and DM educational brochures with follow‐up telephone contact. The intervention group received education and counseling on combined HF and DM self‐care (diet, medications, self‐monitoring, symptoms, and PA) with follow‐up home visit and telephone counseling. Measures included questionnaires for HF‐ and DM‐specific and overall QOL, PA frequency, and physical function (6‐min walk test [6MWT]) and were obtained at baseline and 3 and 6 months. Analysis included mixed models with a priori post hoc tests. Adjusting for age, body mass index, and comorbidity, the intervention group improved in HF total (P = .002) and physical (P < .001) QOL scores at 3 months with retention of improvements at 6 months, improved in emotional QOL scores compared with control at 3 months (P = .04), and improved in health status ratings (P = .04) at 6 months compared with baseline. The intervention group improved in 6MWT distance (924 ft to 952 ft; P = .03) whereas the control group declined (834 ft to 775 ft; F1,63 = 6.86; P = .01). The intervention group increased self‐reported PA between baseline and 6 months (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: An integrated HF and DM self‐care intervention improved perceived HF and general QOL but not DM QOL. Improved physical functioning and self‐reported PA were also observed with the integrated self‐care intervention. Further study of the HF and DM integrated self‐care intervention on other outcomes, such as hospitalization and cost, is warranted.

AB: Background: Traditional obesity prevention programs are time‐ and cost‐intensive. Mobile phone technology has been successful in changing behaviors and managing weight; however, to our knowledge, its potential in young children has yet to be examined.Objective: We assessed the effectiveness of a mobile health (mHealth) obesity prevention program on body fat, dietary habits, and physical activity in healthy Swedish children aged 4.5 y.Design: From 2014 to 2015, 315 children were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Parents in the intervention group received a 6‐mo mHealth program. The primary outcome was fat mass index (FMI), whereas the secondary outcomes were intakes of fruits, vegetables, candy, and sweetened beverages and time spent sedentary and in moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity. Composite scores for the primary and secondary outcomes were computed.Results: No statistically significant intervention effect was observed for FMI between the intervention and control group (mean ± SD: ‐0.23 ± 0.56 compared with ‐0.20 ± 0.49 kg/m2). However, the intervention group increased their mean composite score from baseline to follow‐up, whereas the control group did not (+0.36 ± 1.47 compared with ‐0.06 ± 1.33 units; P = 0.021). This improvement was more pronounced among the children with an FMI above the median (4.11 kg/m2) (P = 0.019). The odds of increasing the composite score for the 6 dietary and physical activity behaviors were 99% higher for the intervention group than the control group (P = 0.008).Conclusions: This mHealth obesity prevention study in preschool‐aged children found no difference between the intervention and control group for FMI. However, the intervention group showed a considerably higher postintervention composite score (a secondary outcome) than the control group, especially in children with a higher FMI. Further studies targeting specific obesity classes within preschool‐aged children are warranted. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02021786.

AB: BACKGROUND: Today's generation of young adults are gaining weight faster than their parents; however, there remains insufficient evidence to inform interventions to prevent this weight gain. Mobile phones are a popular means of communication that may provide a convenient, inexpensive means to deliver health intervention programmes. This pilot study aimed to measure the effect of a 12‐week mobile health (mHealth) intervention on body weight, body mass index and specific lifestyle behaviours addressed by the programme. METHODS: University students and staff aged 18‐35 years (n = 51) were randomised (ratio 1 : 1, intervention : control). Both groups received a printed diet booklet with instructions prepared by a dietitian. The intervention group also received Short Message Service (SMS) text messages (four per week), e‐mails (four per week), and had access to smartphone applications and Internet forums. RESULTS: Pre‐ to post‐intervention, participants in the intervention group decreased their body weight [mean (SD)] [‐1.6 (2.6) kg], increased their light intensity activity [34 (35) min day(‐1)] and reported an increased vegetable (1.0 median serving day(‐1)) and decreased sugar‐sweetened beverage intake [‐355 (836) mL week(‐1)]. Despite this, post‐intervention changes in outcomes were not significantly different from controls. CONCLUSIONS: The piloted mHealth programme provided some short‐term positive changes in weight, nutrition and physical activity using a low cost, convenient delivery method for this population. However, changes were no different from those observed among controls. This might partly be explained by intervention participants' low engagement with the programme, which is likely to require further modification to provide more regular, personalised, monitored support.

AB: This study evaluated a nurse‐delivered, telehealth intervention of cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) versus supportive psychotherapy for chronic back pain. Participants (N = 61) had chronic back pain (pain "daily" >=6 months at an intensity of >=4 of 10 scale) and were randomized to an 8‐week, 12‐session, CBT or to supportive care (SC) matched for frequency, format, and time, with each treatment delivered by a primary care nurse. The primary outcome was the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). Secondary outcomes included the numeric rating scale (NRS) and the Patient Global Impressions Scale (CGI). CBT participants (n = 30) showed significant improvements on the RMDQ (mean = 11.4 [SD = 5.9] vs 9.4 [SD = 6.1] at baseline and post‐treatment, respectively, P <.05; d =.33), NRS (mean = 4.9 [SD = 2.1] vs 4.0 [SD = 1.9], respectively, P <.05; d =.45), and on the CGI (39.1% reporting "much improved" or "very much improved"). SC participants (n = 31) also showed significant improvements on the RMDQ (mean = 11.1 [SD = 5.4] vs 9.1 [SD = 5.2], respectively, P <.05; d =.38), the NRS, (mean = 5.0 [SD = 1.9] vs 3.8 [SD = 2.1], respectively, P <.05; d =.60), and 26.7% reporting "much improved" or "very much improved" on the CGI. Between groups comparisons of CBT and SC showed no differences on the study outcomes (Ps >.10). The results suggest that telehealth, nurse‐delivered CBT, and SC treatments for chronic back pain can offer significant and relatively comparable benefits. Perspective: This article describes the benefits of training primary care nurses to deliver evidence‐based behavioral therapies for low back pain. Because of the high prevalence of chronic pain and the growing emphasis on nonopioid therapies, training nurses to provide behavior therapies could be a cost‐effective way to improve pain management.

AB: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the use of automated systems to prompt patients with diabetes mellitus to obtain overdue laboratory tests for its effectiveness in promoting test compliance and to compare letters, telephone messages, and combinations. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. METHODS: All subjects (N = 13,057) were adult members of Southern California Kaiser Permanente with diabetes and with no record of glycosylated hemoglobin, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and urinary microalbumin tests in more than 1 year. The effectiveness of automated telephone calls and letters was compared versus a no‐contact control group using the following 5 intervention groups: letter, call, letter that is followed by a call 4 weeks later, call that is followed by a letter 4 weeks later, and letter‐call‐letter combination. Messages were in English and in Spanish. Adherence to all testing was compared at 8 weeks and 12 weeks after initial contact using chi(2) test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The proportions of each study group compliant with all tests were 18% to 19% among controls, 21% for a letter or a call, 25% for a letter‐call or call‐letter, and 26% for a letter‐call‐letter; letter‐call and call‐letter were significantly different versus controls (P <.001), and letter‐call‐letter was not significantly different versus letter‐call. Older age was associated with compliance (P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: The pairing of automated letters and telephone calls in any order was more effective than any single intervention in promoting compliance with diabetes monitoring tests. The relative cost of the letter‐call and call‐letter approaches to outreach should be considered to determine which is preferred in any given situation.

AB: Introduction: Cognitive training (CT) offers a potential approach for dementia prevention and maintenance of cognitive function in older adults. Online delivery provides a cost‐effective means of implementing CT compared with in‐person interventions, with the potential of providing an effective public health intervention for risk reduction. Methods: A double‐blind 6‐month online randomized controlled trial in adults older than 50 randomized to General CT, Reasoning CT, or control. The primary outcome was instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in adults older than 60. Secondary outcomes were reasoning, verbal short‐term memory, spatial working memory, verbal learning (VL), and digit vigilance in adults older than 50. Secondary analyses were performed with a group defined as showing age‐associated impairment in reasoning according to baseline scores in this domain. Results: A total of 2912 adults older than 60 (6742 > 50) participated. General and reasoning packages conferred benefit to IADL (P = .008, P = .011), reasoning (P < 0.0001, P < .0001), and VL (P = .007, P = .008) at 6 months. Benefit in reasoning was evident from 6 weeks. Other benefits developed over 6 months. Analysis of participants with age‐associated impairment also showed the same pattern of benefit. A clear dose‐response effect was seen. Conclusions: Online CT confers significant benefit to cognition and function in older adults, with benefit favoring the Reasoning package. Scale of benefit is comparable with in‐person training, indicating its potential as a public health intervention. Impact on the group with age‐associated impairment indicates a particular sensitivity to this at‐risk group, which merits further investigation.

AB: Objective: Patients with psoriasis regularly experience physical and psychological impairments, which are often not fully addressed in routine dermatological care. A potential (cost‐)effective solution to this problem may be to offer an adjuvant internet‐based cognitive behavioral treatment to risk groups of patients with psoriasis. The aim of the current study is to examine the efficacy of therapist‐guided and individually‐tailored eHealth cognitive behavioral treatment for risk groups of patients with psoriasis in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Patients from four outpatient dermatology departments and one patient association were screened for elevated levels of distress. Risk groups were included in a randomized controlled trial comparing assessing guided, tailored, internet‐based cognitive behavioral treatment (n=65) compared to care as usual for controls (n=66). Outcome measures included the impact of psoriasis on daily life, including its impact on physical and psychological functioning and daily activities at post‐treatment, and follow‐up measurement at six months after post‐treatment. Secondary outcomes included patient‐reported improvements at post‐treatment. Results: At post‐treatment, patients indicated improvements in both coping and complaints, and were satisfied with the eHealth cognitive behavioral treatment. Positively rated intervention aspects include face‐to‐face intake sessions, setting of treatment goals, and online therapist contact. Conclusion: Preliminary results indicate that eHealth cognitive behavioral treatment for patients with psoriasis is feasible and effective from the patients' perspective, suggesting its potential value as an adjuvant treatment for this patient group.

AB: Cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRP) are medically supervised, multidisciplinary programs that provide secondary prevention aimed at addressing risk factors and improving lifestyle behaviours for patients following an acute cardiac event. CRPs have been demonstrated to be a cost‐effective and evidence‐based mechanism to improve patient outcomes, but despite the known benefits of these programs, uptake remains poor. Poor attendance has been linked to many factors, but geographical accessibility is a key concern, since many CRPs are limited to hospitals in urban areas. The widespread availability of the Internet has made it possible to provide virtual health services to populations that may have previously been hard to access. This paper examines the qualitative findings from a 16‐month mixed methods randomized controlled trial examining the impact of a virtual CRP (vCRP). The vCRP was revealed to be an accessible, appropriate, convenient and effective way to deliver cardiac rehabilitation services, with patients experiencing both clinical improvements and a high level of satisfaction. To understand the experience of patients undertaking the vCRP, semi‐structured interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of 22 participants. An analysis of the qualitative interviews revealed that the vCRP improved participants' access to healthcare professionals, supported them to make healthy choices, and enhanced feelings of accountability due to greater surveillance. Barriers to participation, such as computer literacy, and general perceptions of a vCRP were also examined. Further investigation into the use and long‐term effectiveness of virtual programs across a broader range of healthcare settings is warranted, particularly in those with multiple chronic diseases and those located in rural and remote communities.

AB: Background and Aims: Occupational/physical therapy improves poststroke outcomes in a dose‐dependent manner. However, many patients receive suboptimal therapy doses for reasons that include cost, availability, and difficulty with travel. This problem is likely to increase with time given the aging population and increased post‐stroke survival rates. Telehealth, defined as the delivery of health‐related services and information via telecommunication technologies, can potentially address this unmet need. The current study examined the effect of a home‐based telerehabilitation program designed to improve motor recovery and patient education in patients with stroke. Method: Using a randomized, assessor‐blinded, controlled, non‐inferiority clinical trial, a total of 124 participants were enrolled across 11 US centers as part of the NIH StrokeNet clinical trials network. Entry criteria included arm motor deficits (arm motor Fugl‐Meyer (FM) score 22‐56 /66), stroke onset 4‐36 weeks prior, and age ±18. Those with significant depression, cognitive impairment, or communication deficits were excluded. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive 6 weeks of intensive arm motor therapy either (a) in a traditional in‐clinic setting or (b) via in‐home telerehabilitation (rehabilitation services delivered to the subject's home via an internet‐connected computer). Therapy intensity, duration, and frequency were matched across the two groups, with all participants assigned 36 sessions (18 supervised and 18 unsupervised), 80 minutes each (including a 10 minute break), over 6 weeks. The primary endpoint is within‐subject change in FM score from the Baseline Visit to 30 Day Follow‐Up Visit. Additional measures pertain to stroke education, secondary prevention, behavioral compliance, and patient motivation. Results: Will‐be‐presented. Conclusion: Will‐be‐presented.

AB: BACKGROUND: Because of a high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in people with Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH), early prevention of cardiovascular disease is important for health gain and cost reduction. This project focuses on the development and evaluation of an innovative intervention aiming to reduce CVD risk by promoting a healthy lifestyle among people with FH. METHODS: This project is designed as a randomised controlled trial in which individuals with FH will be assigned randomly to a control or intervention group. In the intervention group (n = 200), participants will receive a personalized intervention which is a combination of web‐based tailored lifestyle advice and personal counselling by a lifestyle coach. The control group (n = 200) will receive care as usual. Primary outcomes are biological indicators of CVD risk: systolic blood pressure, glucose, BMI, waist circumference and lipids (triglycerides, total, LDL and HDL cholesterol). Secondary outcomes are: healthy lifestyle behaviour (with regard to smoking, physical activity, dietary pattern and compliance to statin therapy) and psychological correlates and determinants of healthy lifestyle behaviour (knowledge, attitude, risk perception, social influence, self‐efficacy, cues to action, intention and autonomy). Measurement will take place at baseline, and at 3 and 12 months after randomisation. Additionally, a throughout process‐evaluation will be conducted to assess and monitor intervention implementation during the trial. DISCUSSION: Results of the PRO‐FIT project will provide information about the effects and implementation of a healthy lifestyle intervention for individuals with FH. Our experiences with this intervention will be indicative about the suitability, feasibility and benefits of this approach for future interventions in other high‐risk groups, such as Familial Combined Hypercholesterolemia (FCH) and diabetes.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes is growing in epidemic proportions and disproportionately affects lower‐income, diverse communities. Text messaging may provide one of the most rapid methods to overcome the "digital divide" to improve care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, nonblinded, parallel‐groups clinical trial design allocated N = 126 low‐income, Hispanic participants with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes to receive the Dulce Digital intervention or usual care (UC). Dulce Digital participants received up to three motivational, educational, and/or call‐to‐action text messages per day over 6 months. The primary outcome was HbA1c; lipids, blood pressure, and BMI were secondary outcomes. Satisfaction and acceptability were evaluated via focus groups and self‐report survey items. RESULTS: The majority of patients were middle‐aged (mean age 48.43 years, SD 9.80), female (75%), born in Mexico (91%), and uninsured (75%) and reported less than a ninth‐grade education level (73%) and mean baseline HbA1c 9.5% (80 mmol/mol), SD 1.3, and fasting plasma glucose 187.17 mg/dL, SD 64.75. A statistically significant time‐by‐group interaction effect indicated that the Dulce Digital group achieved a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c over time compared with UC (P = 0.03). No statistically significant effects were observed for secondary clinical indicators. The number of blood glucose values texted in by participants was a statistically significant predictor of month 6 HbA1c (P < 0.05). Satisfaction and acceptability ratings for the Dulce Digital intervention were high. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a simple, low‐cost text messaging program was found to be highly acceptable in this sample of high‐risk, Hispanic individuals with type 2 diabetes and resulted in greater improvement in glycemic control compared with UC.

AB: BACKGROUND: The relationship between physical activity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) protection is well documented. Numerous factors (e.g. patient motivation, lack of facilities, physician time constraints) can contribute to poor PA adherence. Web‐based computer‐tailored interventions offer an innovative way to provide tailored feedback and to empower adults to engage in regular moderate‐ to vigorous‐intensity PA. To describe the rationale, design and content of a web‐based computer‐tailored PA intervention for Canadian adults enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS/DESIGN: 244 men and women aged between 35 and 70 years, without CVD or physical disability, not participating in regular moderate‐ to vigorous‐intensity PA, and familiar with and having access to a computer at home, were recruited from the Quebec City Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study centre. Participants were randomized into two study arms: 1) an experimental group receiving the intervention and 2) a waiting list control group. The fully automated web‐based computer‐tailored PA intervention consists of seven 10‐ to 15‐min sessions over an 8‐week period. The theoretical underpinning of the intervention is based on the I‐Change Model. The aim of the intervention was to reach a total of 150 min per week of moderate‐ to vigorous‐intensity aerobic PA. DISCUSSION: This study will provide useful information before engaging in a large RCT to assess the long‐term participation and maintenance of PA, the potential impact of regular PA on CVD risk factors and the cost‐effectiveness of a web‐based computer‐tailored intervention.

KY: Substance‐Related Disorders
AB: Quality improvement (Ql) methods are a cornerstone of business and healthcare management throughout the United States yet there have been few studies of Ql interventions in addiction treatment settings. The proposed study tests the effectiveness of one Ql system ‐ Patient Feedback (PF) ‐ at increasing outpatient group therapy attendance and self‐reported abstinence. The feasibility and acceptability of PF was established in a six‐site study conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network. In the proposed study, 32 community‐based outpatient treatment programs with approximately 250 clinicians will be randomly assigned to PF, or usual clinic practices. In the PF condition, every week fro 12 weeks clinic patients are invited to complete a 12‐item, self‐administered survey in which they rate therapeutic alliance and treatment satisfaction, and report past week substance use. These anonymous surveys are faxed by clinic staff to a University of Pennsylvania data center where a custom software application converts the surveys into feedback reports and posts them to a password protected website. Clinicians can access their caseload feedback reports and aggregated reports for the whole clinic; supervisors can only access the aggregated clinic reports. On a monthly basis staff meet as a team to review the feedback reports and develop Ql plans intended to yield improvements in select Ql indicators. The PF website and the monthly PF e‐newsletter provide social recognition, clinical resources, and a virtual community for participating clinicians. After 12 weeks, participants in both conditions complete follow‐up measures and then both groups are given open access to PF for 12 additional months. During "sustainability phase" staff usage of the PF website is monitored. Alternate versions of the PF Survey are introduced during the sustainability study, including one that monitors HIV risk behavior. The rapid processing of surveys enables near real time feedback to clinic staff. Organizations may share their feedback reports with funding sources, regulatory agencies, policy makers, and other stakeholders. This centralized, semi‐automated feedback system eases fulfillment of accreditation requirements and as such, reduces the cost of clinic operations.

AB: Introduction: People with severe mental disorders typically experience a range of health problems; consequently, interventions addressing multiple health behaviors may provide an efficient way to tackle this major public health issue. This two‐arm randomized controlled trial among people with psychotic disorders examined the efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) plus either a faceto‐ face or predominantly telephone delivered intervention for smoking cessation and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction. Methods: Following baseline assessment and completion of a common, individually delivered 90‐minute face‐to‐face intervention, participants (n = 235) were randomized to receive NRT plus: (1) a "Healthy Lifestyles" intervention for smoking cessation and CVD risk behaviors or (2) a predominantly telephone‐based intervention (designed to control for NRT provision, session frequency, and other monitoring activities). Research assistants blind to treatment allocation performed assessments at 15 weeks (mid‐intervention) and 12 months after baseline. Results: There were no significant differences between intervention conditions in CVD risk or smoking outcomes at 15 weeks or 12 months, with improvements in both conditions (eg, 12 months: 6.4% confirmed point prevalence abstinence rate; 17% experiencing a 50% or greater smoking reduction; mean reduction of 8.6 cigarettes per day; mean improvement in functioning of 9.8 points). Conclusions: The health disparity experienced by people with psychotic disorders is high. Faceto‐ face Healthy Lifestyle interventions appear to be feasible and somewhat effective. However, given the accessibility of telephone delivered interventions, potentially combined with lower cost, further studies are needed to evaluate telephone delivered smoking cessation and lifestyle interventions for people with psychotic disorders.

KY: Breast Neoplasms
AB: Many couples experience sexual problems following breast cancer treatment, and difficulties with intimacy and sexuality tend to extend past the 1 year post‐treatment point. Given that resources available for couples who experience sexual distress after breast cancer are virtually non‐existent, there is a need to develop and empirically evaluate psychosexual interventions for breast cancer patients and their partners. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, process, and outcomes of an online, couples‐based intervention designed to address sexual problems encountered by many couples facing breast cancer. The intervention will take place in the form of six E‐therapy sessions delivered via secure, encrypted videoconferencing software commonly used by health care providers practicing telemedicine. Each session will be supplemented by psychoeducational materials (i.e. reading and/or video) available through a privately accessed homepage for the study. Thirty couples will participate in the study, and will be be randomized to either the treatment condition or the wait‐list control condition. Participants assigned to the wait‐list will have the option of receiving the online program once they have completed their commitment to the study (approximately 5 months later). In addition to completing standardized questionnaires, couples will participate in pre‐ and post‐treatment interviews, which will be analyzed thematically in order to improve the intervention and its delivery. The proposed project builds upon existing research pertaining to the sexual health implications of female cancer survivorship, and will fill a gap both in the literature and support available to breast cancer survivors experiencing sexual distress. Given that sexual distress is such a crucial concern for women with breast cancer, and that the majority of couples experiencing sexual difficulties may not receive adequate support in this regard, the goal of the proposed project will be the creation of an accessible, cost‐effective, empirically validated tool that could help improve the quality of life of couples affected by breast cancer.

AB: Purpose: The current approach for detecting serious retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants at risk requires an examination by an ophthalmologist with experience in ROP. Such expertise is in short supply and comes with a high cost, and therefore alternative approaches are needed. We describe the training and certification process for obtaining ROP digital images by non‐physician Certified Retinal Imagers (CRI) in the multicenter Telemedicine Approaches to evaluating acute‐phase Retinopathy of Prematurity (e‐ROP) Study. Methods: Non‐physicians were trained to obtain a standard set of retinal images including disc central, disc right, disc left, disc up, and disc down by using the RetCam Shuttle (Clarity, Pleasanton, CA), a wide field imaging camera system (with 130degree lens). The backgrounds of CRIs varied including NICU nurses, neonatal nurse practitioners, ophthalmic photographers, ocular coherent tomographers, and ophthalmic technologists. Certification consisted of onsite instruction by an experienced retinal imager from Clarity, hands on training during the Technical Group meeting, submitting a series of 3 sets of 6 images each to the e‐ROP Reading Center for review and resubmission until satisfactory, a visit from the Office of Study Chair to evaluate imaging on site, and completion of a series of knowledge assessments. Quality and completeness of images was monitored throughout the Study duration. Results: Twenty six non‐physician imagers in 12 clinical centers were certified as CRIs for the Study. They obtained 7905 gradable image sets. The completeness of image sets increased with experience (10.4% incomplete during first 6 months vs 5.9% during last 6 months, p<0.001). Also, the quality of images improved with experience (89% gradable during first 6 months vs 93% during last 6 months). Conclusions: Non‐physicians can be successfully trained and certified for obtaining retinal images from infants with birth weights of <1251g of sufficient quality for grading in the severe ROP detection telemedicine system.

AB: Objective: To evaluate a holistic multidisciplinary outpatient model of care on hospital readmission, length of stay and mortality in older patients with multimorbidity following discharge from hospital. Design and Participants: A pilot case‐control study between March 2006 and June 2009 of patients referred on discharge to a multidisciplinary, integrated outpatient model of care that includes outpatient follow‐up, timely GP communication and dial‐in service compared with usual care following discharge, within a metropolitan, tertiary referral, public teaching hospital. Controls were matched in a 4:1 ratio with cases for age, gender, index admission diagnosis and length of stay. Main outcome measures: Non‐elective readmission rates, total readmission length of stay and overall survival. Results: A total of 252 cases and 1008 control patients were included in the study. Despite the patients referred to the multidisciplinary model of care had slightly more comorbid conditions, significantly higher total length of hospital stay in the previous 12 months and increased prevalence of diabetes and heart failure by comparison to those who received usual care, they had significantly improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.70 95% CI 0.51‐0.96, p = 0.029) and no excess in the number of hospitalisations observed. Conclusion: Following discharge from hospital, holistic multidisciplinary outpatient management is associated with improved survival in older patients with multimorbidity. The findings of this study warrant further examination in randomised and cost‐effectiveness trials. Copyright © 2016 Shakib et al.

KY: Multiple Sclerosis; Sclerosis
AB: As a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurologic problem which the most frequent cause of disability in young adults. Fatigue, pain, spasticity, muscle weakness, depression, as well as balance and gait disorders are amongst the symptoms of MS. Balance disorders and the falls caused by them are the most frequent problems which result in disability of MS patients, with 75% of all patients being affected during the course of disease. When considering previous studies carried out on physiotherapy and rehabilitation practices in the light of balance disorders and other related problems faced by MS patients, it can been that various physiotherapeutic approaches are applied with varying follow‐up times and in the form of hospital sessions, home sessions, or group training. Posture and balance problems in MS patients are tried to be solved through long‐lasting treatment sessions using traditional methods of physiotherapy, where less patient participation is observed. Fatigue, psychological impairment, and insufficient motivation are other aspects which influence the success of treatment and which need to be addressed in MS patients. In contrast to traditional methods of physiotherapy applied in form of long‐lasting treatment sessions, technology‐supported rehabilitation approaches have emerged in recent years. It can be seen that different systems have started to be employed in the physiotherapy of many chronic diseases, either alone or in company with traditional methods. Even though the clinical use of these systems is becoming widespread, there are certain gaps in terms of the systems' impacts, comparative advantages, or cost effectiveness. Keeping this in mind, the purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the impacts of 'Nintendo Wii Fit' and 'Balance Trainer', as two of the technologic methods with therapeutic impact which have started to be used for different diagnosis groups in recent years, on the balance and posture parameters of MS patients, with the ultimate aim to introduce a whole new point of view to traditional physiotherapy and rehabilitation studies.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy compliance is essential to treat patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). CPAP therapy prevalence is estimated at two‐thirds of all home respiratory therapies, but health resources assigned to promote therapy compliance are reduced. A telemedicine‐based approach for CPAP therapy management could be of great benefit for OSA patients. METHODS: In a multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) we compared two groups of recently diagnosed OSA patients receiving face‐to‐face vs Internet‐based CPAP follow‐up, where a web platform we previously developed (Isetta, ATS2012) supports the follow‐up and visits are via videoconference. Both groups answer periodical surveys about sleep time, CPAP side effects, lifestyle and have two follow‐up visits (month 1 and 3). At the end of the study (6 months) main outcomes will be CPAP compliance, quality of life and cost‐effectiveness. RESULTS: Considering patients who finalized the trial (72/140) compared with baseline, at 6 months face‐to‐face group reported improvement in sleepiness (Epworth 10.7±5.2 vs 5.4±3.6;p<0.001) as well as Internet‐based group (10.7±5.1 vs 6.7±4.2;p<0.001). Also, the majority of both face‐to‐face and Internet‐based patients reported absence of either mask leaks (70.2% vs 57.1%;p=0.327) and nasal congestion (80.0% vs 79.4%;p=1). CONCLUSION: At 6 months, both groups showed improvement in sleepiness and similar outcomes in mask leaks and nasal congestion. These preliminary results suggest that a telemedicine‐based strategy can be as effective as the face‐to‐face approach in OSA patients' management. The final results will build solid evidence on clinical impact.

AB: Objective: We undertook the design and implementation of a proactive telecommunication tool, EpxEpilepsy, to more accurately and frequently track seizures, thereby improving the care of epilepsy patients. Additionally, we present a cost‐benefit analysis that demonstrates its capability to enable new revenue generation for providers under recent fee‐for‐service codes. Background: To fill in the gaps between often long periods between clinic visits, epilepsy management revolves around self‐recorded seizure diaries, which can be inaccurate and incomplete. Tracking seizures with high temporal resolution is critical for medication titration, which is key to reducing the time to seizure freedom. Design/Methods: EpxEpilepsy is an automated service that uses text messages and phone communications to ask patients about seizure events. Responses are tracked and summarized for the provider both in text and graphical formats with alerts notifying the provider of high‐risk individuals. 9 patients from the Washington University Epilepsy Center with a diagnosis of epilepsy were enrolled. Patients received one text message every week for 12 weeks. After the initial 4 weeks, patients were interviewed to understand their experience using EpxEpilepsy. The goal of the pilot study was to track response rates, message fatigue, the percentage of patients who reported seizure activity, and the number of seizures that could be detected by the system. Results: We achieved a 74.1% response rate (95% confidence interval ±8.38%) and detected 180 seizures, with a third of our patients at a 100% response rate. Conclusions: While the study suffers from a small sample size and a nonrandomized uncontrolled design, our data suggests that EpxEpilepsy provides a promising platform for proactive seizure tracking in epilepsy patients. As such, a randomized control trial is ongoing with a larger sample size examining EpxEpilepsy's effect on time to seizure freedom.

AB: Long term kidney allograft survival has remained unchanged in recent years despite immunosuppressive and surgical advances. Ischaemia reperfusion (IR) injury sustained at the time of transplantation contributes to fibrosis which limits allograft lifespan. Interventions to reduce IR injury may therefore prolong graft life, delaying the need for a return to dialysis, with its incumbent risks and reduction in patient quality of life. Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), in which brief episodes of non lethal ischaemia applied to the arm or leg activate an innate whole body protective reflex against subsequent potentially lethal IR injury, has been reported to be beneficial in terms of cardiac, renal and neurological protection in small scale trials. REPAIR (Renal Protection Against Ischaemia Reperfusion in Transplantation), a multicentre, multinational randomised trial, investigated whether RIPC can improve kidney function and other clinical outcomes following renal transplantation. REPAIR recruited 406 live donor/recipient pairs (original target 400). Each pair was randomised using a factorial design to four groups: control (sham RIPC), RIPC immediately prior to surgery, RIPC 24 hours pre‐surgery or dual RIPC. The RIPC stimulus consisted of four 5 minute inflations of a blood pressure cuff on the upper arm to 40 mmHg above systolic blood pressure separated by 5 minute deflations. The sham procedure consisted of four inflations to 40 mmHg separated by 5 minute deflations. By April 2014 all patients will have completed 12 month follow up. Results will be presented on the primary endpoint of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using iohexol clearance at 12 months post‐transplant together with the pre‐specified secondary endpoints. The findings of REPAIR will establish whether this simple, non‐invasive and virtually cost free intervention can improve graft function, and ultimately lead to prolonged allograft life in these patients, with resultant economic and quality of life benefits. The findings will also have implications for the use of RIPC in other ischaemic syndromes.

AB: In underserved populations, inadequate surveillance and treatment allows hypertension to persist until actual cardiovascular events occur. Thus, we developed an Internet‐based telemedicine system to address the suboptimal control of hypertension and other modifiable risk factors. To minimize cost, the subjects used home monitors for blood pressure (BP) measurements and entered these values into the telemedicine system. We hypothesized that patients could accurately measure their BP and transmit these values via a telemedicine system. Inner city and rural subjects (N = 464; 42% African‐American or Hispanic) with 10% or greater 10‐year risk of cardiovascular disease and with treatable risk factors were randomized into two groups, control group (CG) and telemedicine group (TG). Each subject received a home sphygmomanometer with memory. The TG recorded and entered BP at least weekly. During office visits, the BP meters were downloaded and recorded BP compared to BP values transmitted via telemedicine. The telemedicine (T) BP values were similar to the meter recorded (R) values (T: systolic/diastolic BP 133.4 +/‐ 11.1/77.5 +/‐ 6.8 mm Hg, and R: systolic/diastolic BP 136.4 +/‐ 11.9.4/79.7 +/‐ 7.5 mm Hg). The percent error was <1% for both systolic (‐0.02 +/‐ 0.04%) and diastolic (‐0.03 +/‐ 0.04%) BP. Lastly, the telemedicine BP values were similar to the office (O) BP values for systolic and diastolic BP (T: systolic/diastolic BP 133.4 +/‐ 11.1/77.5 +/‐ 6.8 mm Hg, and O: systolic/diastolic BP 136.3 +/‐ 20.5/78.1 +/‐ 10.5 mm Hg). In underserved populations, this inexpensive approach of patients using a home monitor and entering these values into a telemedicine system provided accurate BP data.

AB: BACKGROUND: Childhood overweight and obesity is a global public health challenge. Primary prevention initiatives targeting parents have been called for to encourage a positive feeding environment and healthy eating habits that may lay a good foundation for future health. At the same time, there is a need for interventions which combine accessibility and scalability with cost effectiveness. Today's parents are extensive Internet‐users, but only a few randomized controlled trials have investigated the use of Internet to promote healthy eating habits in early childhood. In Early Food for Future Health we have developed and will evaluate an Internet‐based tool for parents of children between 6 and 12 months, aiming to increase knowledge about infant nutrition and foster protective feeding behavior. METHODS: During springtime 2016, parents of children aged between 3 and 5 months were recruited through Norwegian child health centres and announcements on Facebook. After completing the baseline questionnaire, 718 parents were individually randomized to intervention‐ or control group. The intervention group received monthly emails with links to an age‐appropriate web‐site when their child was between 6 and 12 months. The control group received ordinary care from the child health centres. The data‐collection is ongoing. All participants will be followed up at ages 12 and possibly 24 and 48 months, with questionnaires relating to eating behaviour and feeding practices, food variety and diet quality. DISCUSSION: Providing guidance and counseling to parents of infants is an important task for health authorities and the public child health services. Early Food for Future health is an intervention focusing on promoting early healthy food‐habits which may prevent childhood overweight and obesity. If proven to be effective, Early Food for Future Health can be used by parents and public health nurses for supplementary guidance on feeding practices and diet. This study has the potential to provide greater insight and understanding regarding early parental feeding practices, child eating behavior and the development and efficacy of Internet‐based public health interventions.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Smoking is the most preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in U.S. veterans. Rural veterans in particular have elevated risk for smoking and smoking‐related illness. However, these veterans underutilize smoking cessation treatment, which suggests that interventions for rural veterans should optimize efficacy and reach. OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention that combines evidenced based treatment for smoking cessation with smart‐phone based, portable contingency management on smoking rates compared to a contact control intervention in a randomized controlled trial among rural Veteran smokers. Specifically, Veterans will be randomized to receive Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy (ART) which combines evidenced based cognitive‐behavioral telephone counseling (TC), a tele‐medicine clinic for access to nicotine replacement (NRT), and mobile contingency management (mCM) or a control condition (i.e., TC and NRT alone) that will provide controls for therapist, medication, time and attention effects. METHODS: Smokers were identified using VHA electronic medical records and recruited proactively via telephone. Participants (N=310) are randomized to either ART or a best practice control consisting of telephone counseling and telemedicine. Participating patients will be surveyed at 3‐months, 6‐months and 12‐months post‐randomization. The primary outcome measure is self‐reported and biochemically validated prolonged abstinence at 6‐month follow‐up. DISCUSSION: This trial is designed to test the relative effectiveness of ART compared to a telehealth‐only comparison group. Dissemination of this mHealth intervention for veterans in a variety of settings would be warranted if ART improves smoking outcomes for rural veterans and is cost‐effective.

AB: BACKGROUND: Although lifestyle and medications are effective for coronary heart disease (CHD) risk reduction, few studies have examined the comparative effectiveness of various strategies for delivering high quality CHD risk reduction. In this paper, we report on the design and baseline characteristics of participants for just such a trial. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of the same lifestyle and medication intervention delivered in two alternate formats: counselor‐delivered or web‐based. The trial was conducted at 5 diverse practices in a family medicine research network and included men and women age 35‐79 who were at high risk of CHD events based on 10‐year predicted Framingham risk of ≥10% or a known history of cardiovascular disease. After individual‐level randomization, participants in both arms received a decision aid plus four intensive intervention visits and 3 maintenance visits over 12 months. The primary outcome was change in 10‐year predicted CHD risk among patients without prior cardiovascular disease. Secondary outcomes, measured among all participants, included changes in CHD risk factors, cost‐effectiveness, and acceptability at 4 and 12‐month follow‐up. RESULTS: We randomized 489 eligible patients: 389 without and 100 with a known history of cardiovascular disease. Mean age was 62.3. 75% were white, 25% African‐American. 45% had a college education. 88% had health insurance. Mean 10‐year predicted CHD risk was 16.9%. CONCLUSION: We have successfully recruited a diverse sample of practices and patients that will provide a rich sample in which to test the comparative effectiveness of two strategies to implement high quality CHD prevention.

AB: BACKGROUND: Pedestrian injuries are a leading cause of paediatric injury. Effective, practical and cost‐efficient behavioural interventions to teach young children street crossing skills are needed. They must be empirically supported and theoretically based. Virtual reality (VR) offers promise to fill this need and teach child pedestrian safety skills for several reasons, including: (A) repeated unsupervised practice without risk of injury, (B) automated feedback on crossing success or failure, (C) tailoring to child skill levels: (D) appealing and fun training environment, and (E) most recently given technological advances, potential for broad dissemination using mobile smartphone technology. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Extending previous work, we will evaluate delivery of an immersive pedestrian VR using mobile smartphones and the Google Cardboard platform, technology enabling standard smartphones to function as immersive VR delivery systems. We will overcome limitations of previous research suggesting children learnt some pedestrian skills after six VR training sessions but did not master adult‐level pedestrian skills by implementing a randomised non‐inferiority trial with two equal‐sized groups of children ages 7‐8 years (total N=498). All children will complete baseline, postintervention and 6‐month follow‐up assessments of pedestrian safety and up to 25 30‐min pedestrian safety training trials until they reach adult levels of functioning. Half the children will be randomly assigned to train in Google Cardboard and the other half in a semi‐immersive kiosk VR. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) models will assess primary outcomes. DISCUSSION: If results are as hypothesised, mobile smartphones offer substantial potential to overcome barriers of dissemination and implementation and deliver pedestrian safety training to children worldwide.

AB: BACKGROUND: Dental caries affecting the primary dentition of U.S. children continues to be the most prevalent chronic childhood disease. Preventive screening for dental caries in toddlers by dental professionals is labor‐intensive and costly. Studies are warranted to examine innovative screening modalities that reduce cost, are less labor‐intensive, and have the potential to identify caries in high‐risk children. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety‐one children were randomized into two groups: Group 1 received a traditional, visual tactile examination initially and follow up‐examinations at 6 and 12 months, and Group 2 received a teledentistry examination initially and follow‐up examinations at 6 and 12 months. The mean primary tooth decayed and filled surfaces (dfs) scores were calculated for all children at baseline and 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean dfs score for children examined by means of teledentistry was 2.19, and for the children examined by means of the traditional method, the mean was 1.27; the means were not significantly different. At the 12‐month examination, the mean dfs score for the children examined by means of teledentistry was 3.02, and for the children examined by means of the clinical method, the mean dfs was 1.70; the means were not significantly different. At 12 months the mean fillings score for the children examined by means of teledentistry was 1.43 and for the children examined by means of the clinical method was 0.51; the means were statistically significantly different (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the teledentistry examinations were comparable to clinical examinations when screening for early childhood caries in preschool children. The data further showed that color printouts of teeth with cavities provided to parents of children who received teledentistry screenings promoted oral healthcare utilization, as children from the teledentistry study group received more dental care than children from the clinical study group.

AB: BACKGROUND: Recruiting participants to randomized controlled trials of health interventions can be very difficult. Internet‐based recruitment is becoming an increasingly important mode of recruitment, yet there are few detailed accounts of experiences recruiting participants to mental health interventions. OBJECTIVE: To report on our experience with Internet‐based recruitment to an online depression prevention intervention and pass on lessons we learned. METHODS: Participants were recruited to the Mood Memos study, an online preventive depression intervention, purely through Internet‐based sources. The study was targeted to adults with subthreshold depression symptoms from several English‐speaking countries. A variety of online recruitment sources were trialed, including search engine advertising (Google, Yahoo!, Bing), Facebook advertising, posts in forums and online noticeboards, and promotion through relevant websites and email newsletters of mental health organizations. RESULTS: The study website received visits from 94,808 individuals over the 14‐month recruitment period. The recruitment target was reached with 1699 individuals signing up to the randomized controlled trial and 1326 fully enrolling. Most visitors arrived via Google advertising, which promoted a depression‐screening questionnaire. Google advertising accounted for nearly half of the total participants who signed up to the study, at an average cost of AUD $12 per participant. Promoting the study through trustworthy organizations and websites known to participants was also effective. Recruitment techniques that were less effective were contacting forums, email groups, and community noticeboards. CONCLUSIONS: Several techniques, including Google advertising, were successful in recruiting participants to a trial evaluating an online depression intervention. Results suggest that Internet‐based recruitment to mental health interventions is feasible and can be relatively affordable. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12609000925246.

AB: Background. In the light of diagnostic and therapeutic advances, patients with a previous myocardial infarction or with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are vulnerable and need continuous monitoring over time. These pathological frameworks have a strong impact on the economy and on the status of the population and require effective and low‐cost solutions. Aims. The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy in the short term of a telephone counseling intervention to modify the lifestyles of these two patient populations. Methods. In May 2015, all the patients included in the study underwent a questionnaire to evaluate their eating and smoking habits and their quality of life. After randomization in two groups, the intervention group received telephone counseling related to the correct lifestyles. The control group did not undergo any intervention. In September‐October 2015, the same initial questionnaire was administered to evaluate changes in patients’ behavior. Results. 64 patients were included in the study: 34 were assigned to the intervention group and 30 to the control group. The outcomes evaluated were: quality of life, assessment of eating habits and smoking status. After the telephone counseling, the intervention group (34 persons) showed a significant improvement in the score of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (p = 0.01) and a significant reduction in the percentage of smokers (p = 0.01) compared to the population that did not receive any intervention (30 persons). On the other hand, the changes related to the quality of life questionnaire were not significant. Conclusions. A single telephone counseling intervention is effective in modifying the lifestyles of patients with a previous myocardial infarction or diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the short term, reducing their risk profile.

AB: Objectives This study examined the differential impact of two telehealth programs for women caring for an older adult with a neurocognitive disorder. Outcomes examined were depressive symptoms, upset following disruptive behaviors, anxious and angry mood states, and caregiving self‐efficacy. Methods Women cohabitating with a family member diagnosed with a neurocognitive disorder were assigned via random allocation to either of the following: (1) a 14‐week behavioral intervention using video instructional materials, workbook and telephone coaching in behavioral management, pleasant events scheduling, and relaxation or (2) a basic education guide and telephone support comparison condition. Telephone assessments were conducted by interviewers blind to treatment condition at pre‐intervention, post‐intervention, and 6 months following intervention. Results For those providing in‐home care at post‐treatment, depressive symptoms, upset following disruptive behaviors, and negative mood states were statistically lower in the behavioral coaching condition than in the basic education and support condition. Reliable change index analyses for Beck Depression Inventory II scores favored the behavioral coaching condition. Caregiving self‐efficacy scores for obtaining respite and for managing patient behavioral disturbances were significantly higher in the coaching condition. Effect sizes were moderate but not maintained at the 6‐month follow‐up. Conclusions This study provides some initial evidence for the efficacy of a telehealth behavioral coaching intervention compared with basic education and telephone support. Carers' abilities to maintain strategy use during progressive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease likely require longer intervention contact than provided in the current study. Dementia carers, including those living in rural areas, can benefit from accessible and empirically supported interventions that can be easily disseminated across distances at modest cost.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of "My Care My Call" (MCMC), a peer‐led, telephone‐based health self‐management intervention in adults with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). DESIGN: Single‐blinded randomized controlled trial. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of adults with SCI (N=84; mean time post‐SCI, 9.9y; mean age, 46y; 73.8% men; 44% with paraplegia; 58% white). INTERVENTIONS: Trained peer health coaches applied the person‐centered health self‐management intervention with 42 experimental subjects over 6 months on a tapered call schedule. The 42 control subjects received usual care. Both groups received the MCMC Resource Guide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome‐health self‐management as measured by the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). Secondary outcomes‐global ratings of service/resource use, health‐related quality of life, and quality of primary care. RESULTS: Intervention participants averaged 12 calls over 6 months (averaging 21.8min each), with distinct variation. At 6 months, intervention participants reported a significantly greater change in PAM scores (6mo: estimate, 7.029; 95% confidence interval, .1018‐13.956; P=.0468) compared with controls, with a trend toward significance at 4 months. At 6 months, intervention participants reported a significantly greater decrease in social/role activity limitations (estimate, ‐.443; P=.0389), greater life satisfaction (estimate, 1.0091; P=.0522), greater services/resources awareness (estimate, 1.678; P=.0253), greater overall service use (estimate, 1.069; P=.0240), and a greater number of services used (estimate, 1.542; P=.0077). Subgroups most impacted by MCMC on PAM change scores included the following: high social support, white persons, men, 1 to 6 years postinjury, and tetraplegic. CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrates that the MCMC peer‐led, health self‐management intervention achieved a positive impact on self‐management to prevent secondary conditions in adults with SCI. These results warrant a larger, multisite trial of its efficacy and cost‐effectiveness.

AB: BACKGROUND: Telephone nursing is the first line of contact for many care‐seekers and aims at optimizing the performance of the healthcare system by supporting and guiding patients to the correct level of care and reduce the amount of unscheduled visits. Good statistical models that describe the effects of telephone nursing are important in order to study its impact on healthcare resources and evaluate changes in telephone nursing procedures. OBJECTIVE: To develop a valid model that captures the complex relationships between the nurse's recommendations, the patients' intended actions and the patients' health seeking behavior. Using the model to estimate the effects of telephone nursing on patient behavior, healthcare utilization, and infer potential cost savings. METHODS: Bayesian ordinal regression modeling of data from randomly selected patients that received telephone nursing. Inference is based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, model selection using the Watanabe‐Akaike Information Criteria (WAIC), and model validation using posterior predictive checks on standard discrepancy measures. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We present a robust Bayesian ordinal regression model that predicts three‐quarters of the patients' healthcare utilization after telephone nursing and we found no evidence of model deficiencies. A patient's compliance to the nurse's recommendation varies and depends on the recommended level of care, its agreement with and level of the patient's prior intention, and the availability of different care options at the time. The model reveals a risk reducing behavior among patients and the effect of the telephone nursing recommendation is 7 times higher than the effect of the patient's intended action prior to consultation if the recommendation is the highest level of care. But the effect of the nurse's recommendation is lower, or even non‐existing, if the recommendation is self‐care. Telephone nursing was found to have a constricting effect on healthcare utilization, however, the compliance to nurse's recommendation is closely tied to perceptions of risk, emphasizing the importance to address caller's needs of reassurance.

AB: IntroductionStandard treatment for neovascular age‐related macular degeneration (nAMD) is intravitreal injections of anti‐VEGF drugs. Following multiple injections, nAMD lesions often become quiescent but there is a high risk of reactivation, and regular review by hospital ophthalmologists is the norm. The present trial examines the feasibility of community optometrists making lesion reactivation decisions.MethodsThe Effectiveness of Community vs Hospital Eye Service (ECHoES) trial is a virtual trial; lesion reactivation decisions were made about vignettes that comprised clinical data, colour fundus photographs, and optical coherence tomograms displayed on a web‐based platform. Participants were either hospital ophthalmologists or community optometrists. All participants were provided with webinar training on the disease, its management, and assessment of the retinal imaging outputs. In a balanced design, 96 participants each assessed 42 vignettes; a total of 288 vignettes were assessed seven times by each professional group.The primary outcome is a participant's judgement of lesion reactivation compared with a reference standard. Secondary outcomes are the frequency of sight threatening errors; judgements about specific lesion components; participant‐rated confidence in their decisions about the primary outcome; cost effectiveness of follow‐up by optometrists rather than ophthalmologists.DiscussionThis trial addresses an important question for the NHS, namely whether, with appropriate training, community optometrists can make retreatment decisions for patients with nAMD to the same standard as hospital ophthalmologists. The trial employed a novel approach as participation was entirely through a web‐based application; the trial required very few resources compared with those that would have been needed for a conventional randomised controlled clinical trial.

AB: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Telerehabilitation has the potential to increase access to pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for patients with COPD who have difficulty accessing centre‐based PR due to poor mobility, lack of transport and cost of travel. We aimed to determine the effect of supervised, home‐based, real‐time videoconferencing telerehabilitation on exercise capacity, self‐efficacy, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) and physical activity in patients with COPD compared with usual care without exercise training. METHODS: Patients with COPD were randomized to either a supervised home‐based telerehabilitation group (TG) that received exercise training three times a week for 8 weeks or a control group (CG) that received usual care without exercise training. Outcomes were measured at baseline and following the intervention. RESULTS: Thirty‐six out of 37 participants (mean ± SD age = 74 ± 8 years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 ) = 64 ± 21% predicted) completed the study. Compared with the CG, the TG showed a statistically significant increase in endurance shuttle walk test time (mean difference = 340 s (95% CI: 153‐526, P < 0.001)), an increase in self‐efficacy (mean difference = 8 points (95% CI: 2‐14, P < 0.007)), a trend towards a statistically significant increase in the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire total score (mean difference = 8 points (95% CI: ‐1 to 16, P = 0.07)) and no difference in physical activity (mean difference = 475 steps per day (95% CI: ‐200 to 1151, P = 0.16)). CONCLUSION: This study showed that telerehabilitation improved endurance exercise capacity and self‐efficacy in patients with COPD when compared with usual care.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Internet‐based sex therapy for men with erectile dysfunction has been advocated as an easily accessible and cost‐effective treatment. AIM: To test whether Internet‐based sex therapy is superior to waiting list. METHODS: Internet‐based therapy was administered to heterosexual men with erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation, without face‐to‐face contact, in a waiting‐list controlled design, with pre‐, post‐, and follow‐up measurements at 3 and 6 months posttreatment. Treatment was based on the sensate‐focus model of Masters and Johnson, and supplemented with cognitive restructuring techniques. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self‐reported improvement of sexual functioning, erectile functioning (men with ED), premature ejaculation (men with PE), sexual desire, overall sexual satisfaction, and sexual self‐confidence. RESULTS: Ninety‐eight men participated (58 ED, 40 PE). Sexual functioning was much or somewhat improved in 40 participants (48%). In participants with ED, a near significant effect of treatment was found (P = 0.065), with higher levels of sexual desire (P < 0.05) and sexual self‐confidence (P = 0.05) in treated men, in addition to improved erectile functioning (P = 0.01) and overall sexual satisfaction (P < 0.001) in both groups. In participants with PE, treatment was not superior to waiting list. In participants with ED, erectile functioning (P < 0.05) and overall sexual satisfaction (P = 0.002) improved significantly. In participants with PE, latency to ejaculation (P < 0.001), sexual desire (P < 0.05), and overall sexual satisfaction (P < 0.05) improved significantly from baseline to posttreatment, with no further changes at both follow‐ups. Sexual self‐confidence in men with PE remained unchanged during treatment until follow‐up at 3 months posttreatment, and then was found to be improved at 6‐months follow‐up (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Internet‐based sex therapy for male erectile dysfunction was efficacious for male erectile disorder. For men with premature ejaculation, however, treatment was not superior to waiting list.

AB: Background and Aims: Increasing incidence and prevalence of diabetes are a major strain on health‐care resources. Telehealth can improve traditional care delivery and equitable distribution of health‐care services with cost‐efficiencies. This is relevant for overcoming geographical barriers in a country like Australia. This study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of patients attending a tertiary hospital (Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia) diabetes telehealth service (DTS) with specialist face‐to‐face diabetes outpatient service (DOS). Method: A cross‐sectional survey was undertaken as part of the well‐established Australian National Diabetes Audit in May 2016 (focussed on patient education and self‐management practices) and May 2017 (focussed on clinical management practices). Corresponding data from the two surveys were combined and analysed. Results: 284 and 62 diabetes patients were surveyed in the DOS and DTS groups respectively. In the DOS group, 179 (63.0%) were type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and 98 (34.5%) were type 1 diabetes (T1DM). 44 (71.0%) DTS patients had T2DM and 15 (24.2%) were T1DM. There was no statistical difference between groups (DOS Vs DTS) in HbA1c, when analysed for T2DM (8.2%‐66mmol/mol Vs 8.7%‐72mmol/mol) and T1DM (8.3%‐67mmol/mol Vs 9.0%‐95mmol/mol); in the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c less than 8%(64mmol/mol); and in the proportion of diabetes treatment methods. Among T2DM patients, there was a statistically significant higher proportion of indigenous patients in DTS group(31.8% Vs 1.1%). Initial visits were higher in DTS group. Conclusion: This analysis reveals similar clinical outcomes in glycaemic management among T1DM and T2DM patients in both DOS and DTS groups. As the DTS delivers services in regional Queensland, Australia, it provides a valuable service to patients in underserved areas.

DOI: 10.1007/s11136-017-1658-6
AB: Aims: The use of patient‐reported outcomes (PRO) might support more flexible, cost‐saving outpatient follow‐up activities. In the Danish PRO‐system, AmbuFlex, PRO data is used as the basis for outpatient follow‐up instead of conventional follow‐up with prescheduled appointments in the clinic. The patients' self‐reported PRO data are used by clinicians as decision aid to support whether a patient needs contact to the clinic or not. Based on experiences from AmbuFlex, the Danish government and regions, who run the public hospitals, have decided on a national strategy for implementation of PRO. The aim is to describe experiences with large scale implementation of PRO in outpatient follow‐up. Method: The AmbuFlex concept includes three generic elements: PRO data collection, PRObased decision algorithm, and PRO‐based graphical overview. Experiences will be described with respect to these elements. Furthermore, experiences with evaluating the value of PRO will be described. Results: By January 2017, AmbuFlex is used by approximately 19,000 patients within 18 different patient groups in Denmark. In outpatients with epilepsy and sleep apnoea, 48 and 57%, respectively, of the incoming PRO responses were handled without further contact to the patient than the PRO assessment. A randomised study among outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis has found that PRObased tele‐health follow‐up achieved similar disease control as conventional outpatient follow‐up. Clinicians as well as patients reported high satisfaction with the system. Conclusion: The use of PRO in outpatient follow‐up is feasible and may be recommended as the basis for outpatient follow‐up in several patient groups with chronic and malignant diseases.

AB: Purpose: To evaluate whether the presentation of a video within the informed consent consultation affects patient knowledge about refractive excimer laser treatment, satisfaction with the informed consent process, anxiety in respect to the planned surgery, and the consultation duration. Setting: Tertiary referral center, Lucerne, Switzerland. Design: Single‐center, randomized controlled trial. Methods: Consenting eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either a conventional face‐to‐face consultation (conventional group) or a conventional consultation with additional video‐assisted information (interventional group). Knowledge and satisfaction with the informed consent process and anxiety regarding surgery were assessed. Differences between groups were tested with Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney, Chi‐square, and Student t tests. Results: The study comprised 113 patients (58 in the conventional group and 55 in the interventional group). There was no difference in terms of knowledge with 22/25 points (interquartile range [IQR], 3) in the conventional group versus 22/25 points (IQR, 2) in the interventional group (P =.957), satisfaction with the informed consent (“very satisfied”: 47/58 versus 45/55; P =.915) and anxiety toward surgery with a median 8 (IQR, 4) versus median 9 (IQR, 3; P =.159). In the interventional group, however, the total consultation time was significantly lower than in the conventional group (−4.96 minutes; 95% CI, −9.50 to −0.43; P =.032). Conclusion: Compared with a conventional consultation, video‐assistance slightly reduced the total consultation time while maintaining patient knowledge, satisfaction with the informed consent process, and anxiety regarding the surgery on equal levels. Video‐assistance could increase efficiency of clinical management on a double‐digit percentage at an equal running cost compared with a conventional consultation.

AB: BACKGROUND: There is a need for randomized, prospective trials of case management interventions with resource utilization analyses. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether algorithm‐driven telephone care by nurses improves lipid control in patients with diabetes. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with diabetes at a federally funded community health center were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 381) or usual‐care (n = 381) groups. INTERVENTIONS: Nurses independently initiated and titrated lipid therapy and promoted behavioral change through motivational interviewing and self‐management techniques. Other parameters of diabetes care were addressed based on time constraints. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) less than 100 mg/dL. Secondary outcomes included the number of hospital admissions, total hospital charges per patient, and the proportion of patients meeting other lipid, glycemic, and blood pressure guidelines. KEY RESULTS: The percent of patients with an LDL < 100 mg/dL increased from 52.0% to 58.5% in the intervention group and decreased from 55.6% to 46.7% in the control group (P < .01). Average cost per patient to the healthcare system was less for the intervention group ($6600 vs $9033, P = .03). Intervention patients trended toward fewer hospital admissions (P = .06). The intervention did not affect glycemic and blood pressure outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses can improve lipid control in patients with diabetes in a primarily indigent population through telephone care using moderately complex algorithms, but a more targeted approach is warranted. Telephone‐based outreach may decrease resource utilization, but more study is needed.

KY: Brain Injuries; Depression; Wounds and Injuries
AB: Each year, approximately 50,000 Canadians sustain an acquired brain injury (ABI) with 16,000 of those individuals living in Ontario. Individuals with ABI not only suffer significant cognitive and motor impairments, but they often experience debilitating emotional distress. Emotional distress uniquely contributes to poorer functional outcomes and decreased quality of life. Moreover, emotional distress confers risk for the subsequent development of serious mental illness such as depression, anxiety disorders, suicide and possibly psychotic illness. While a great deal of clinical resources are devoted to the cognitive and motor sequelae of ABI, the concomitant psychological and psychiatric sequelae of brain injury often receive relatively little attention in in‐patient and day‐hospital programs, and the expense and inaccessibility of therapeutic services are often prohibitive for consumers in the sub‐acute and chronic stages of brain injury. Moreover, few psychological interventions are tailored to the specific cognitive needs and content issues of brain‐injured consumers. We have taken a well‐validated mode of psychological treatment used in face‐to‐face therapeutic settings ‐ Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) ‐ and adapted it for the needs of brain‐injured clients. Thus far, the protocol has been adapted for content issues and cognitive impairments of people with ABI, it has been adapted for telehealth delivery, it has been through expert review, and its feasibility has been assessed. The aim of the proposed research is to demonstrate in a randomized control trial (RCT) the efficacy of the adapted protocol, both in a standard delivery modality (i.e., face to face and group) and in the telehealth delivery modality in comparison to an education control group. The treatment is focused on improving coping skills and decreasing psychological distress post‐ABI. If proven effective, the intervention could be used cost‐effectively by a range of therapists (e.g., Psychologists; Psychiatrists; Occupational Therapists and Social Workers) to improve coping, adjustment and quality of life for ABI consumers irrespective of geographical location, mobility restrictions or economic status.

AB: Patients in isolated rural settings often lack easy access to pain care and specialist services. Yet rural residents are more likely than their urban counterparts to be older; be in poorer overall health; suffer from more chronic or serious illnesses and disabilities; be uninsured or underinsured; and live in poverty. Telehealth is an emerging method of health care delivery that has been found useful and effective in many clinical settings and specialties. Telehealth technologies can bridge geographic distance and increase access to specialist care in rural settings. The investigators propose a cluster randomized clinical trial design to test the effects of a telehealth‐enhanced palliative care pain‐management program for 240 patients and 40 providers in rural health care settings. The proposed program will provide services to both patients and providers: Patients will conduct self‐assessments and report pain and other symptoms via telehealth. Health care providers will receive telehealth‐delivered case consultations that will include case management, evidence‐based practice resources, and peer support. Providers and their patients will be randomly assigned to intervention groups, which receive the telehealth‐enhanced palliative care pain‐management intervention, or to control groups. The investigators primary aim is to compare patient self‐reports of pain and quality of life in the intervention and control groups over 2 months. Aim 2 is to examine, in the intervention and control groups over 2 months, providers' knowledge and attitudes regarding pain and perceived competence in treating pain. Aim 3 is to evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of the telehealth intervention. The investigators will use mixed effects models with patients nested within providers to evaluate the effect of the intervention on study outcomes. Findings from this study will be instrumental in advancing telehealth and improving pain management and palliative care among underserved rural populations.

AB: Background: Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that benefits from specialty care. Telehealth is an innovative resource that can enhance access to this care within a patientcentered framework. Research suggests that telehealth can lead to increased patient satisfaction, equal or better clinical outcomes, and cost savings, but these outcomes have not been well‐studied in PD. Methods: We conducted a dual active‐arm 12‐ month randomized controlled trial to assess patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, travel burden, and health care utilization in PD using video telehealth for follow‐up care with specialty providers. Telehealth visits took place either at a facility nearer to the patient (satellite clinic arm) or in the patient's home (home arm). Each control group received usual in‐person care. Patient satisfaction, assessed by quantitative questionnaires, was the primary outcome. Results: Eighty‐six menwere enrolled (home arm: 18 active, 18 control; satellite clinic arm: 26 active, 24 control) with a mean age of 73 years (range 42'87). There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the active group and the controls in each arm (p . 0.05). A significant difference in overall patient satisfaction was not found; however, high levels of patient satisfaction were found in all groups. Greater satisfaction for the telehealth modality was found in assessments of convenience and accessibility/distance. Clinical outcomes were similar between groups, travel burden was reduced using telehealth, and health care utilization was largely similar in both groups. Conclusions: As the need for PD subspecialty care increases, innovative patient‐centered solutions to overcoming barriers to access, such as video telehealth, will be invaluable to patients and may provide high patient satisfaction.

AB: E‐mental health services are Internet‐based treatment options for mental illness. There has been a proliferation of these services in recent years, with online programs now available for the treatment of mood, anxiety, eating, adjustment, and substance use disorders. (1) E‐mental health services allow for greater dissemination of psychological treatments, are cost effective, and may overcome a number of client barriers to care. (1) However, the limited research available indicates that attitudes about e‐mental health services are less than optimal. Past research has found that providing information about services can improve attitudes. This study investigated the relationship between knowledge of e‐mental health services and attitudes toward e‐mental health services. The attitudes examined were the perceived helpfulness of e‐mental health services and the likelihood of using the services. Participants (N=217) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: provision of e‐mental health information by means of film; provision of e‐mental health information by text; or provision of no e‐mental health information. Results indicated that participants perceived online programs without therapist assistance as being significantly less helpful, and reported reduced likelihood of engaging in these programs when compared to other e‐mental health services. Participants in the text intervention group reported higher likelihood of e‐mental health use in the future, whereas there were no effects for the film group. Results indicate that participants perceive important differences between types of e‐mental health services, and that a brief text intervention can improve attitudes toward these services. Limitations of the present study and directions for future research are discussed.

AB: Introduction: The epidemiological transition has progressively made the most prevalent chronic diseases over the last century, with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and neoplasias with smoking as a preventable risk factor. Brazil has a prevalence of 12.9 to 25% of its smoking population, which increases the risk of morbidity and mortality and reduces life expectancy. In this scenario, encouraging smokers to quit is one of the most cost‐effective interventions available in clinical practice. Objectives: To evaluate intervention through an electronic tool, designed to motivate smokers to make the decision to stop smoking. Methodology: Prospective, randomized study evaluating patients in the waiting room of the Hiperdia Minas Center in Juiz de Fora/ Brazil, aimed at the care of hypertensive, diabetic and chronic renal patients with high cardiovascular risk, from 05/2016 to 02/2017, in your initial consultation in the service. In those who reported being smokers, two groups were divided: Intervention Group (GI), using an interactive and educational video about smoking and Control Group (CG), using a basic approach to smoking. All participants were invited to participate in smoking cessation groups in the service (UAI‐T). Results: Sixty‐six smokers, 50% in GI and 50% in GC, 64.7% of them female; 63.5%, with a low level of schooling. Regarding smoking history and comparing GI with CG, we observed that users smoked significantly more cigarettes/ day (p <0.005) in the GI, and there were no statistical differences between the interest and the confidence to stop the addiction in both groups. When assessing decision making in seeking help for cessation, GI tended to be more significant (p= 0.067), compared to CG. Conclusion: Alternative interventions to increase motivation to quit smoking should be encouraged and show promise for reaching this goal.

AB: BACKGROUND: Mobile technology may serve as a cost‐effective and scalable tool for delivering behavioral nutrition interventions. This research sought to iteratively develop a theory‐driven mobile app, Vegethon, to increase vegetable consumption. METHODS: Development of Vegethon followed phases outlined by the IDEAS framework: 1) empathize with users (qualitative interviews, n = 18); 2) specify target behavior; 3) ground in behavioral theory; 4) ideate implementation strategies; 5) prototype potential products; 6) gather user feedback (qualitative interviews, n = 14; questionnaire, n = 41); 7) build minimum viable product; and 8) pilot potential efficacy and usability (pilot RCT, n = 17). Findings from each phase informed subsequent phases. The target population that informed intervention development was 18‐50 years of age, had BMIs of 28‐40 kg/m(2), and lived in the geographical area surrounding Stanford University. A full description of the final version of Vegethon is included in the paper. RESULTS: Qualitative findings that shaped initial intervention conception were: participants' interests in accountability without judgment; their desire for simple and efficient dietary self‐monitoring; and the importance of planning meals in advance. Qualitative findings identified during intervention refinement were the need for a focus on vegetable self‐monitoring; inclusion of vegetable challenges; simplification of features; advice and inspiration for eating vegetables; reminder notifications; and peer comparison. Pilot RCT findings suggested the initial efficacy, acceptance, and feasibility of the intervention. The final version of Vegethon enabled easy self‐monitoring of vegetable consumption and included a range of features designed to engage the user (e.g., surprise challenges; leaderboard; weekly reports). Vegethon was coded for its inclusion of 18 behavior change techniques (BCTs) (e.g., goal setting; feedback; social comparison; prompts/cues; framing/reframing; identity). CONCLUSIONS: Vegethon is a theory‐based, user‐informed mobile intervention that was systematically developed using the IDEAS framework. Vegethon targets increased vegetable consumption among overweight adults and is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial.

KY: Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive
AB: Respiratory rehabilitation (RR) has been shown to provide benefits in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with a degree of evidence A. These benefits are primarily focused on an increase in the capacity of effort for activities of daily living and in an improvement in the quality of life related to health (HRQOL) a constant to the RR critique is the fact that the benefits achieved with programmes are lost in a progressive and constant way once the patient completes the treatment and lost contact with the team. The introduction of new technologies in different fields of medicine has been a new approach when it comes to the management of various diseases and treatments in chronic patients. In the case of the RR telemedicine provides a new tool. COPD disease very prevalent and chronic it is generator of a high economic cost. The possibility of universalizing the rehabilitation treatment would involve a potential savings in this population group ,another potential benefit is as translational trial as part of the development of a new technology and its possible application to clinical practice. General objective: to determine whether a program of TeleRehabilitation (TeleRR)‐ Respiratory Rehabilitation Maintenance (RRm) after an intensive initial program of RR, is a useful intervention against the current usual strategy (intensive program of RR and a recommendation of not protected maintenance program). Method: clinical trial , open, randomized, multicenter, parallel group, and focus of superiority with a strategy of Telerehabilitation program respiratory of maintenance after an intensive RR for 8 weeks in patients diagnosed with grade moderately ‐ severe stable COPD (Bode 3‐7).

AB: Background: Health coaching is a client‐centric process to increase motivation and self‐efficacy that supports sustainable lifestyle behavior changes and active management of health conditions. This study describes an intervention offered as a benefit to health plan members and examines health and behavioral outcomes of participants. Methods: High‐risk health plan enrollees were invited to participate in a telephonic health coaching intervention addressing the whole person and focusing on motivating health behavior changes. Outcomes of self‐reported lifestyle behaviors, perceived health, stress levels, quality of life, readiness to make changes, and patient activation levels were reported at baseline and upon program completion. Retrospectively, these data were extracted from administrative and health coaching records of participants during the first 2 full years of the program. Results: Less than 7% of the 114 615 potential candidates self‐selected to actively participate in health coaching, those with the highest chronic disease load being the most likely to participate. Of 6940 active participants, 1082 fully completed pre‐ and post‐ health inventories, with 570 completing Patient Activation Measure (PAM). The conditions most often represented in the active participants were depression, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, osteoporosis, asthma, and low back pain. In 6 months or less, 89% of participants met at least one goal. Significant improvements occurred in stress levels, healthy eating, exercise levels, and physical and emotional health, as well as in readiness to make change and PAM scores. Discussion: The types of clientselected goals most often met were physical activity, eating habits, stress management, emotional health, sleep, and pain management, resulting in improved overall quality of life regardless of condition. Positive shifts in activation levels and readiness to change suggest that health coaching is an intervention deserving of future prospective research studies to assess the utilization, efficacy, and potential cost‐effectiveness of health coaching programs for a range of populations.

AB: OBJECTIVE: The premise of the National Institute of Mental Health Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode Early Treatment Program (RAISE‐ETP) is to combine state‐of‐the‐art pharmacologic and psychosocial treatments delivered by a well‐trained, multidisciplinary team in order to significantly improve the functional outcome and quality of life for first‐episode psychosis patients. The study is being conducted in non‐academic (ie, real‐world) treatment settings, using primarily extant reimbursement mechanisms. METHOD: We developed a treatment model and training program based on extensive literature review and expert consultation. Our primary aim is to compare the experimental intervention to "usual care" on quality of life. Secondary aims include comparisons on remission, recovery, and cost‐effectiveness. Patients 15‐40 years old with a first episode of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, or brief psychotic disorder according to DSM‐IV and no more than 6 months of treatment with antipsychotic medications were eligible. Patients are followed for a minimum of 2 years, with major assessments conducted by blinded, centralized raters using live, 2‐way video. We selected 34 clinical sites in 21 states and utilized cluster randomization to assign 17 sites to the experimental treatment and 17 to usual care. Enrollment began in July 2010 and ended in July 2012 with 404 subjects. The results of the trial will be published separately. The goal of the article is to present both the overall development of the intervention and the design of the clinical trial to evaluate its effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that we have succeeded in both designing a multimodal treatment intervention that can be delivered in real‐world clinical settings and implementing a controlled clinical trial that can provide the necessary outcome data to determine its impact on the trajectory of early phase schizophrenia.

SO: Http://www.who.int/trialsearch/trial2.aspx? Trialid=actrn12613000403730
YR: 2013
AB: INTERVENTION: Mitii: Move it to improve it is an internet‐ based multimodal therapy which combines upper limb (UL) training within the context of meaningful physical activity that can be accessed in children's homes. Inherent in this approach is the ability to scaffold visual perception skills and cognitive challenge, both important aspects of activity engagement in a virtual training environment. The program is potentially cost effective as only 3 center based therapists (occupational therapist, physiotherapist, neuropsychologist) are required to provide initial assessment, goal setting and training for families and participating children. Each therapist is then able to remotely moditfy the individualised program each week. The current application proposes to test the efficacy of Mitii in a waitlist randomised controlled trial. We propose to provide Mitii at an intensity of 30 minutes per day for 6 days per week over 20 weeks (total dose 60 hours). All children will therefore receive the therapy within 12 months of being randomised either to commence Mitii immediately or after 5 months, with retention of effects tested at 40 weeks. As current therapy programs are resource intensive and time consuming it its important to determine if gains from Mitii are sustained as this could offer a cost effective model of care, particularly for rural, remote and isolated children with acquired brain injuries. CONDITION: Acquired brain injury PRIMARY OUTCOME: Improvement in motor and process skills in daily living activities as demonstrated by a 0.5 logit score on the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS). SECONDARY OUTCOME: Improvement in Activity limitations (unimanual capacity and bimanual performance) by a mean difference of 5 points on the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) and 7.4% or greater on the Melbourne Assessment Unilateral Upper Limb function (MUUL), a 10% decrease in time on the Jebsen‐Taylor Test of Hand Function (JTTHF). Improvement in neurovascular changes as measured on functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI] will be more extensive and retained for a longer. Improvements in Executive functioning (EF: including information processing, attentional control, cognitive flexibility, goal setting, working memory and behavioural manifestations of EF in everyday life ‐ BRIEF). Improvements in Occupational performance (as measured on the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure, COPM performance and satisfaction) Improvements in participation (as measured on the Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation, The Child and Family Follow up Survey)which indicates the extent of participation in important activities at home, school and community environments (PEM‐CY). Improvements in physical activity capacity immediately following Mitii training (Functional strength: half kneel through stand, sit to stand and step up tests; and Six‐minute fast walk test, high level balance and mobility ‐ HiMAT) and the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG). Improvements in physical activity performance (recorded using the ActiGraph) and greater compliance with the Australian National Physical Activity Guidelines. Improvements in Psychological functioning as measured on the Strength and difficulties Quesstionnaire (SDQ). Improvements in the functioning and participation domains of quality of life (on the Kidscreen‐52 Quesstionnaire); Improvements on the functional abilities in self care and daily activities (MobQues47 Questionnaire); Improvment in visual perception (visual discrimination, visual memory and visual sequential memory) as measured by the Test of Visual Perceptual Skills (TVPS). Mitii will be more cost‐effective compared with Usual Care as shown by resource use and consequence based on function (AMPs) and quality of life (CHU‐9D/Kidscreen52). INCLUSION CRITERIA: i. Sufficient cooperation, cognitive understanding, visual acuity and verbal communication to perform the assessments and intervention; ii. Minimum 12 months since most recent head injury sustained; iii. Equivalent GMFCS I to II and MACS I to III; (ie independently ambulate and handle most types of objects independently) iv. Classification of Moderate (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score 9 to12 and/or neurosurgical intervention) or Severe (GCS score <9 and/or neurosurgical intervention) brain injury. v. Able to participate in the study over a 12 month period (i.e. stable homeenvironment) vi. Screened for eligibility by rehabilitation specialist vii.The child will be considered for the study if the child had a physical impairment following brain injury and now presents with a residual physical impairment (e.g. may only be mild fine motor or high level gross motor, or motor processing difficulties).

KY: Obesity; Pediatric Obesity
AB: Background As noted above, EMPOWER is a multi‐disciplinary, team‐based clinic model, involving physicians, psychologists, registered dietitians (RDs), and physical therapists (PTs) providing tertiary care management of obesity. Data from the first two years of EMPOWER show that patients with four or more visits (n=109) experienced a decrease in average BMI z‐score (‐0.09SD). This, though modest, is promising; however, both cost and patient retention present significant challenges to EMPOWER and other tertiary care pediatric obesity programs, and may be barriers to further progress. Much administrative personnel time is consumed in working with insurers in order to authorize visits, and nevertheless, this type of hospital‐based care is poorly reimbursed. Getting to Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) is often a major challenge for our patients, due to the large urban sprawl of Los Angeles, traffic, limited and expensive parking, and poor public transportation. Frequent visits result in missed work and school days, a burden to families. Adolescent patients face even greater challenges, as they learn to manage their own health and balance the emotional and social changes required in the transition to adulthood, with family and parental expectations and limitations. Telehealth technology presents an innovative, cost‐effective, and often highly‐engaging alternative to in‐person visits, which bypasses many of the logistical difficulties of getting to CHLA. Moreover, adolescents today are highly attuned to, and aligned with, digital and mobile technologies, and are natural consumers of media in this format. There is strong evidence from numerous published studies that telehealth can be an effective tool for chronic disease management. Additionally, many youth with obesity are significantly socially isolated, and our current individual patient‐provider model does not effectively address this isolation in the way we expect a group session will; various published studies of group treatment have demonstrated inter‐participant support and positive effects of social interaction. While Empower's current model leads to successful weight management in many of its patients, that success is often modest, as alluded to above; and for some of patients, it simply does not work. With this study, the investigators intend to pilot a group telehealth model targeted at adolescents with obesity. Specifically, the investigators aim to: 1. Pilot a new care delivery model for CHLA EMPOWER patients using group telehealth visits. 2. Assess the feasibility of using telehealth with adolescent patients 3. Test the efficacy of group appointments using telehealth Hypotheses: 1. Use of shared medical appointments via telehealth is a feasible, cost‐effective care delivery model for adolescents being treated for obesity. 2. Efficacy of this model will be comparable to, or better than, standard multi‐disciplinary in‐person visits. This will be measured by: a. Clinical and anthropomorphic data: i. Changes in Body Mass Index (BMI), BMI percentile, and BMI percent of the 95th percentile ii. Change in blood pressure percentile iii. Change in hemoglobin A1C, ALT, triglycerides b. Quality of life c. Self‐efficacy d. Satisfaction 3. Attendance to telehealth visits will be better than attendance to standard in‐person visits, as measured by no‐show rates and same‐day reschedules Methods and study design: Youth 14‐18 years of age who meet EMPOWER clinic criteria and consent to the study will be prospectively randomized to the intervention telehealth group (n=24) or the standard EMPOWER group (n=24). Since the investigators do not expect a statistically significant difference in BMI change between the telehealth intervention and standard EMPOWER, power calculations were conducted on change scores in Quality of Life indicators. Using Optimal Design software v1.77 and specifying a = 0.05, anticipated effect size δ = 0.40, between‐group variance ranging around 0.05, and controlling for effects of the covariates on Quality of Life outcomes at 3 and 6 months, it is expected that 24 participants per condition will provide a moderate power to identify a treatment effect for proof of concept purposes. The intervention group will receive: ‐ Group telehealth sessions twice per month for 6 months. The group sessions will be 60 minutes and involve delivery of a semi‐structured curriculum including topics such as nutrition education, reducing barriers to physical activity, and mindfulness techniques. Sessions will be facilitated by EMPOWER providers (physicians, psychologists, RDs, and PTs) who will use a combination of: 1) motivational interviewing techniques, modified for the group setting, 2) supportive exploration of barriers to behavior change and 3) setting SMART goals. ‐ Brief individualized coaching by the program coordinator between sessions via telephone or email. It will be comparable to the personalized feedback and motivation provided in standard EMPOWER. ‐ Parent telehealth sessions once a month. It is widely recognized that teens' families must be willing to make changes in order to increase their child's chances for success in weight management. More practically, most food is purchased and prepared by parents or older family members, so it is essential that they receive education and support as well. ‐ Intervention group participants will also be given Bluetooth enabled scales and will be asked to weigh in once a month. Comorbidities such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, PCOS, and NAFLD will be managed remotely through prescriptions and follow‐up lab work and/or imaging coordinated with the patients' primary care physicians. Control subjects will receive the standard EMPOWER model consisting of monthly in person clinic visits where they meet individually with a combination of providers (physician, RD, PT, and/or psychologist). Both intervention and control participants will have in‐person visits at baseline, 3 and 6 months to measure weight, vertical growth, and blood pressure, and complete questionnaires assessing quality of life, self‐efficacy and satisfaction.

AB: INTRODUCTION: Developmental dysplasia of hip (DDH) is a disorder characterised by incomplete development of hip joint. Although DDH is one of the most common skeletal dysplasias, the incidence of DDH is approximately 1.5 cases per 1000 births, and it remains slow and costly to recruit large‐scale patient cohorts for powerful genetic association studies. The UK has an established and expanding e‐health record (EHR) infrastructure that provides a comprehensive platform upon which to develop genomic research of clinical relevance and impact. The National Joint Registry for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (NJR) is the largest registry of joint replacement in the world, with 1.9 million recorded procedures, adding new procedures at a rate of 200,000 each year. In this work we have successfully used the NJR as a platform to generate a DDH biobank of 903 individuals, upon which we have conducted the first ever genome‐wide association study (GWAS) for DDH. Methods: 5411 patients recorded as having a hip replacement for 'hip dysplasia' between March 2003 and December 2013 were approached to participate in the study. Following filtering by questionnaire for non‐DDH cases and non‐European Caucasians 1091 patients were sent an Oragene OG‐500 saliva DNA collection kit (DNAGenotek, Ottawa, Canada). 907 patients returned a completed saliva sample. A randomly selected sample of individuals participating on the UK Household Longitudinal Study that had been previously genotyped using the same platform were used as controls at a casexontrol ratio of 1:4. Samples were genotyped using the Illumina Human Core Exome‐24 Bead Chip and genotypes were called using Illumina Genome Studio Gencall, using a stringent quality control (QC) approach. Following QC the numbers of unrelated cases and controls were 773 and 3364, respectively. A total of 256833 overlapping variants were used for the association analysis, which was performed using SNPTEST v2.5 under an additive model and using a maximum likelihood test. We prioritized 26 independent variants for replication based on statistical significance (P<10‐5). De novo genotyping was performed using the iPLEX® Assay and the MassARRAY® System (Agena Bioscience, Inc.)(formerly Sequenom). Following QC, the replication data set consisted of 332 cases, 1375 controls and 25 variants. Association analysis was performed under an additive genetic model using SNPTEST v2.5. Finally, we performed a fix‐effects meta‐analysis using GWAMA across the discovery and replication data sets, comprising a total of 1105 cases and 4739 controls. Results: Of 256833 variants that passed QC, 53 showed evidence for association in the discovery stage withP<10∼5. Among these, 11 variants reached genome‐wide significance. All these variants came from the same signal, with rsl43384 as the index SNP (allele A, allele frequency 0.60, OR[95% CI] 1.58[1.40‐1.77], P=\. 1x10‐14). Twenty‐six independent variants were prioritized to follow up through de novo replication. Variant rsl43384 was found to be significantly associated with DDH (Figure 1) after meta‐analysing discovery and replication datasets (allele A, allele frequency 0.60, OR[95% CI] 1.50[1.36‐1.66],P=2.81xl0‐16). Discussion: Using eHR case‐ascertainment and distance recruitment strategies we conducted the first GWAS for DDH and after replication and metaanalysis we confirmed association of the GDF5 variant rsl43384 with DDH (P=2.81x10‐16). Rsl43384 is a 5' UTR variant in GDF5, which plays a central role in cell growth and differentiation in both embryonic and adult tissues. This study demonstrates for the first time that routinely‐collected eHR data can be used to provide rapid case‐ascertainment for genetic epidemiological studies. This study also confirms the utility and cost‐effectiveness of distance recruitment approaches based on saliva‐derived DNA collection. Using an entirely postal recruitment and sample collection approach we achieved a 41% sample completer response rate after filtering unsuitable cases. The cost‐effectiveness of the approach is illustrated as follows: the total cost of conducting the discovery GWAS was approximately $130 per recruit. SIGNIFICANCE: We establish the first genome‐wide significant locus for DDH, discovered through linking EHRs with genomics as a proof of principle in enabling powerful genetic association studies of relatively rare but complex diseases.

AB: BACKGROUND: The burden and economic consequences of depression are high, mostly due to its recurrent nature. Due to current budget and time restraints, a preventive, low‐ cost, accessible minimal intervention is much needed. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a supported self‐help preventive cognitive therapy (S‐PCT) added to treatment as usual (TAU) in primary care, compared to TAU alone. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial among 248 patients with a history of depression, currently in full or partial remission or recovery. Participants were randomized to TAU augmented with S‐PCT (n = 124) or TAU alone (n = 124). S‐PCT consisted of an 8‐week self‐help intervention, supported by weekly telephone guidance by a counselor. The intervention included a self‐help book that could be read at home. The primary outcome was the incidence of relapse or recurrence and was assessed over the telephone by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐IV axis 1 disorders. Participants were observed for 12 months. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, quality of life (EQ‐5D and SF‐12), comorbid psychopathology, and self‐efficacy. These secondary outcomes were assessed by digital questionnaires. RESULTS: In the S‐PCT group, 44 participants (35.5%) experienced a relapse or recurrence, compared to 62 participants (50.0%) in the TAU group (incidence rate ratio = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52‐0.97; risk difference = 14, 95% CI 2‐24, number needed to treat = 7). Compared to the TAU group, the S‐PCT group showed a significant reduction in depressive symptoms over 12 months (mean difference ‐2.18; 95% CI ‐3.09 to ‐1.27) and a significant increase in quality of life (EQ‐5D) (mean difference 0.04; 95% CI 0.004‐0.08). S‐PCT had no effect on comorbid psychopathology, self‐efficacy, and quality of life based on the SF‐12. CONCLUSIONS: A supported self‐help preventive cognitive therapy, guided by a counselor in primary care, proved to be effective in reducing the burden of recurrent depression.

YR: 2018
KY: Diabetes Mellitus
AB: AAs have twice the rate of DM as Whites, and worse glycemic control, less optimal medication regimens, and less trust in the medical system. These disparities contribute to why AAs with DM are more likely to go blind, lose limbs, require dialysis, develop dementia, and die than Whites. These disparities, in turn, reflect racial differences in education, income, health literacy, cultural beliefs, experiences of discrimination, and social adversity, which can lead to: 1) poor glycemic control; 2) suboptimal medication use; and 3) mistrust in medical care. DM I‐TEAM addresses these 3 factors, which often precipitate ED and hospital care, using a culturally relevant, multidisciplinary team treatment approach to reduce the need for high acuity medical care, and equip underserved AAs with DM with the knowledge and skill to gain the benefits of high quality medical care that is otherwise available to everyone. Our approach applies currently available treatment elements in a culturally‐relevant way to create a more equitable health landscape. Our immediate goal is to engage a high‐risk population in treatment that can be trusted; that recognizes the realities of their lives (e.g., financial insecurity); that improves the quality of the medication they take, and that builds their self‐efficacy to manage DM. The intermediate goal is to prevent untoward medical events that necessitate ED or hospital care. The long‐term goal is to reverse the pernicious racial disparities that now characterize healthcare in the U.S. DM I‐TEAM can achieve these goals by getting the right care to the right patient at the right time. DM I‐TEAM is the right care because its leverages existing resources in a new way to improve health outcomes in AAs with DM. AAs with DM are the right patients because many have poorly controlled DM, take suboptimal medications, and face treatment barriers, often social in nature. Now is the right time, as the population becomes more racially diverse, healthcare costs increase, and demand for safety, quality, and value intensify. In these ways DM I‐TEAM is right for American healthcare, bringing us closer to Healthy People 2020's twin goals of reducing the personal and societal costs of DM, and achieving health equity for all. DM I‐TEAM takes a dynamic team approach to diabetes management whereby the primary care physician, the study pharmacist, the diabetes educator, and the CHW collaborate to build patient trust, encourage diabetes self‐management, and optimize medication regimens. Each member of the team plays a pivotal role in identifying important information that prevents effective diabetes management, and then works together to provide multi‐layered support to patients. The roles of each team member are as follows: CHW: The CHW extends clinic‐based care into participants' homes to strengthen patient/provider relationships, customize diabetes education, and develop tailored treatment plans. The CHW facilitates telemedicine visits with the PCP and diabetes educator to build trust in the health care system by increasing participants' access to their care team. The quality and content of these visits is enhanced by CHW‐provided information about the participant's life situation (e.g., family circumstances, barriers to optimal diabetes self‐management, home environment), and current self‐management practices and beliefs. There will be 6 90 minute in‐home CHW sessions within 3 months of randomization (telemedicine sessions will occur during 3 of these visits). Booster sessions will occur 5, 7, and 11 months after randomization. During these visits, the CHW will (1) reinforce the diabetes treatment plan articulated by the PCP, (2) gather information regarding barriers to diabetes self‐management behaviors and communicate them to the team; (3) inform the team of the participant's health‐related questions/issues; (4) provide culturally‐relevant diabetes education using appropriate educational materials; (5) work with the participant to formulate and execute diabetes Action Plans using the principles of Behavioral Activation (BA); and (6) communicate the participant's progress with their Action Plans to the team. BA is a behavioral technique based on reinforcement theory that is used to help people overcome avoidant tendencies through goal setting, activity scheduling, and graded task assignment. BA was originally developed to treat depression. Our research has demonstrated that BA can successfully facilitate diabetes self‐management. The DM I‐TEAM treatment manual (which is already developed but will be refined during the study start‐up phase) describes each session in detail, and includes scripts and didactics for the CHW interventionist. The manual is not included in this grant submission due to space limitations. At each session, the CHW educates participants to contact the ED (either by phone or by patient portal) prior to presenting for services. Participants are given "emergency kits" that contain glucometers and related supplies and glucose tablets. The ED physician may recommend that participant's test their glucose and treat hypoglycemia prior to or instead of reporting to the ED. PCP: The PCP provides diabetes care as per standard practice, but care is supplemented with input from the pharmacist and the CHW, and with telemedicine visits. The PCP optimizes medication regimens based on pharmacist recommendations. As the course of treatment progresses, the PCP reinforces Action Plans with the participant during clinic visits. Pharmacist: With information gathered by the CHW and from the participant's electronic medical records (EMR), the pharmacist performs a comprehensive evaluation of the participant's medications to identify medications that are contraindicated in older patients, are not being taken as prescribed, are being taken incorrectly, are improperly dosed, or may be causing undesirable side effects. Based on her assessment, the pharmacist may recommend that the PCP modify the current medication regimen. Diabetes Educator: The diabetes educator provides telemedicine visits to supplement diabetes education provided by the CHW, answer participants' questions, and reinforce medication adherence.

SO: Http://www.who.int/trialsearch/trial2.aspx? Trialid=isrctn14093266
YR: 2018
AB: INTERVENTION: After giving consent and completing a baseline questionnaire, participating patients (clinically stable patients who received a liver transplant between 1 and 5 years previously) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention (myVirtualClinic) or control (standard care) arm of the study using the GraphPad online randomisation tool. Patients randomised to the intervention arm of the study will have routine outpatient appointments with their liver consultant from home via secure video link accessed through the patient portal at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust instead of needing to attend the hospital for a face‐to‐face appointment. Patients randomised to standard care carry on with the standard arrangements for follow‐up and will come to the hospital for face‐to‐face appointments for 12 months as normal. Satisfaction with care is compared in the two groups to see if patients who have had virtual clinics are more or less satisfied with care compared to those who continued having standard care. Interviews are also carried out with patients, carers/family members and healthcare professionals involved in the study to see what their thoughts and experiences of the study were. CONDITION: Liver transplantation ; Surgery PRIMARY OUTCOME: The combined satisfaction score for three domains of the RAND modified Visit‐Specific Satisfaction Instrument (VSQ‐9) (convenience of location, getting through to the office by phone and length of time waiting). The VSQ‐9 asks participants to rate their satisfaction with various aspects of their clinic appointment on a 5‐point scale (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent). Scores are then transformed into a 0‐100 linear scale where higher scores denote higher levels of satisfaction. VSQ‐9 data will be collected at baseline and after every virtual clinic or face‐to‐face appointment via patient questionnaires. A difference of 10 points between the intervention and control groups in the three selected domains of the VSQ‐9 at study end (12 months) will be taken as clinically significant. SECONDARY OUTCOME: 1. Patient reported health‐related quality of life measured through EQ‐5D‐5L patient questionnaires at baseline, 6 months and end of study ; 2. Patient satisfaction scores in the other six VSQ‐9 domains not forming part of the primary outcome measure. Measured through patient questionnaires at baseline, 3 months (if applicable), 6 months, 9 months (if applicable) and 12 months; 3. Routinely collected clinical outcomes collected via patient records at study end; 4. Number and length of clinical contacts, instances of appointment non‐attendance, collected via routinely collected metrics, clinician reporting throughout the study; 5. Health service use, collected via patient questionnaires at baseline and end of study; 6. Patient costs, collected via patient questionnaires at baseline, 3 months (if applicable), 6 months, 9 months (if applicable), 12 months; 7. Secondary care costs, collected via routinely collected data at study end; 8. MyVirtualClinic system performance, collected via routinely collected metrics at study end; 9. Whether patients in the intervention arm have been able to have clinical tests carried out locally prior to their virtual clinic appointment, collected via clinician‐completed case report form after each appointment; 10. Patient, carer and clinician experience of the study, collected via semi‐structured interviews at the end of the study; 11. Questionnaire completion rates, assessed using information on the proportion of questionnaires completed by participating patients at the end of the study; 12. Participants' travel requirements, assessed using patient questionnaire at baseline INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Have had a liver transplant at least 1 year and no more than 5 years prior to study baseline 2. Aged 18 or over 3. Considered clinically stable by their consultant 4. Have access to myhealth@QEHB patient portal (or agree to sign up) 5. Able to arrange for clinical testing (blood tests, weight and blood pressure) to be undertaken locally at a GP practice or dialysis centre and the results uploaded to myhealth@QEHB prior to myVirtualClinic appointment 6. Have access to a computing device (e.g. desktop computer or laptop) running an operating system compatible with the virtual clinic software, as well as camera and internet connection 7. Able to consent to participate in the study

AB: Background: The care of patients (pts) with chronic non‐communicable diseases (CNCD) is one of the main challenges of the future in Europe and in Italy. The EU funded Project SmartCare (“Cohort study on integrated health and social care supported by ICT for European citizens”) involved as lead our region with the aim of improving integrated social and health care through the implementation of home telemonitoring (TLM), empowerment, self‐care and self‐management of heart failure pts. Methods: The SmartCare project in our region has developed as a cohort study, prospective, randomized, controlled trial that enrolled from 11/2014 to 2/2016 201 pts in home care (>50 years, at least 1 severe CNCD (HF, COPD or diabetes) and ≥1 missing BADL) to intervention arm (INT ‐ automatic BP monitoring, weight, FC, SO2, ECG: n=100) or usual care (UC; n=101). The drop‐out were 19 (7 UC; 12 INT; p=NS). The patients were followed up by a multiprofessional team (nurses ‐ including a case manager‐, GPs, social workers, district doctors and specialists) and stratified for “short term” post‐discharge TLM (3‐6 months ‐ average 4±1; n=101) or “long‐term” (6‐12 months ‐ average 10±3; n=100) for chronic frail pts already in home health care. Results: The patients enrolled were elderly (81 years, 54% males), with HF (79%), diabetes (68%) or COPD (38%) and multimorbidity (44% Charlson Index ≥5; 58% ≥7 drugs/day). 58% had a primary level of education, 38% lived alone and 43% were not self‐sufficient. In the follow‐up of 7±4 months (119 pt‐years) were recorded 16 deaths (13.4/100 pt‐years) and 126 hospital admissions/access to intermediate care (1758 days of hospitalization). The home care nurses has recorded 3053 contacts (2.14/pt‐months; 2417 ‐79.2% ‐ home accesses of which 160 (6.6%) unplanned; 536 ‐20.8% ‐ phone calls). In pts enrolled in “long term” INT, TLM has not proven effective. In contrast, in pts enrolled in the “short‐term” post‐discharge INT was demonstrated a significant reduction in hospital stay (0.9 vs 2.8 pt‐months; p=0.048), due to a reduction of the length of stay (10.2 vs 19.2 days; p=0.01), associated with a significant increase in unplanned contacts (1.15 vs 0.03/pts; p=0.04). In particular, each month there was a saving of 1.9 hospital days at the “cost” of 0.7 contacts per patient for control of devices and clinical stability. The same significance was present only in pts with HF. Conclusion: A postdischarge intensive TLM system supported by ICT of pts with CNCD and in particular with HF, on top of home care, is able to significantly reduce the hospital stay with significant but modest increase use of territorial nursing resources.

AB: Methods： This study is an open‐ label controlled randomized cluster trial and will invite eligible physicians and their patients to attend the study. These physicians work in health community center at Shanghai Jiading district and their patients are from the district community. Each physician should care and monitor at least 20 of his or her patients. This serves as a cluster randomized unit. The study size consists of 40 or more units within the Jiading District of Shanghai. Samples will taken from these patients according to the preset schedule and will measure patients' level of HbA1c accordingly. The physicians will recruit their patients who meet the criterion of the Jiading Study Standard. All of these patients have established their own health record by physicians in the community health center. To the enrolled patients, the study will obtain the information such as demographic characteristics, diagnosis and treatment, complications , various of biochemical index, skill and capacity of disease self‐management, etc. Biomarkers and genetic risk factors will be evaluated in the study subjects. The study also will give several training courses to the enrolled physicians and the patients, all of them need to meet the study criteria and will sign the inform consent to participate in the study. The study will use the method of randomized complete block design to classify the enrolled units into 4 groups. Group 1‐ Physicians only; Group 2 ‐ Patients only; Group 3 ‐ Both Physicians and Patients, Group 4 ‐ control. Groups 1‐3 will receive incentives if they can obtain or/and maintain the ideal level of Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) during the 3‐years study period. We aim to achieve a target of HbA1c < 7% or to reduce 0.5% HbA1c level annually during 3 years study period. The incentive is in the form of cash or same value awards. The amount of the incentives will increase annually depending upon the change of HbA1c. The award is served as an motivation factor and token for rewarding the desire for self‐discipline and disease management to enhance self‐efficacy. The control group will not receive any incentives but will be provided diabetes education booklet and group education courses for DM control as usual. The study will use the existing tele‐medicine system to monitor patients' blood pressure and blood glucose remotely. The system of the telemedicine will also provide a series of diabetes education and training courses to support the physicians and the patients about the diabetes treatment, care and the self‐management on the diseases. The study will document the changes on the patients' blood pressure, biochemical index, medication, quality of life, self‐management skill of diabetes, life behavior, complications and costs. Endpoint of the study: The study will be ended in 36 months, endpoint measurement indicators are listed below: 1. Withdraw rate: Patient who drop out from the study; 2. Diabetic complication rate: Patient with new complications, such as macro‐ or micro‐vascular complications; 3. Admission rate due to diabetic related illness： Patient's diabetic condition worsen, needs to be hospitalized or surgery; 4. Frequency of hypoglycemia incidences：Patient who has frequently severe hypoglycemia or other complications that can not continue the study; 5. Mortality rate among enrolled patients Death.

AB: Background: The use of oral anticoagulant therapy with VKA (OAT) has progressively increased in the cardiovascular diseases, such as atrial fibrillation, valvular diseases, and venous thromboembolic disorders. The OAT is currently used in 1.7‐2% of the population. The grade of anticoagulation control is a vital aspect in the quality of clinical care of these patients. The fact that they remain above or below the optimal range exposes the patients to an increased risk of bleeding or stroke. The new technologies of information and communication allow us to optimize the control of these treatments significantly improving their quality of life and safety Aims: 1. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of remote control (RC) of OAT in a group of 100 patients. 2. To analyze the degree of satisfaction and quality of life of patients included in the program. Methods: Prospective multicenter study of the first 100 patients included in our program. The study has been carried out from June 2015 to nowadays. The institutional review board waived informed consent for this health care program that was compliant with the Spanish law in force. The participating centers are: Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Hospital Universitario Infanta Elena, Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos and Hospital General de Villalba. Patients were included if meeting the following inclusion criteria: a history of use of OAT for at least three months, a valid chronic indication for the treatment and patients that were capable of handling computerized devices. The exclusion criteria were: patients under age of 16 years, patients with severe diseases or with less than 3 month of treatment with OAT and those who expressed their desire not to participate in the study. We created a reference unit of OAT composed of doctors and specialized nurses: the doctors made the prescription and gave the specific instructions to the nurses. Once they were taught, they are in charge of the active education of patients. Results: In the first 100 patients included, there there isn't any complication with the treatment and the preliminar results of the quality life surveys are very good. The patients were evaluated in the OAT clinics, and were included when meeting the above mentioned inclusion criteria. Once they had signed the informed consent. After work, in a remote service, we generated a note that was accesible online to the patients in the web Patient Folder. The medical note consists of the prescription. When the control was needed, patient can introduce the result of the digital INR in the same Patient Portal. This web interaction prevents unnecessary movements of the patients and/or family members. There is no separation from the center. Summary/Conclusions: Our RC program is a new technological system that assists patients in the control of OAT from their home. The program consists in adapting new technologies to the healthcare system to gain in quality of life, with fewer complications, greater safety and comfort for patients and reducing travelling to the hospital and costs. With this program the patients are an actives subjects in the management of their disease.

AB: OBJECTIVE: Anger is a symptom of post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with a range of clinical and functional impairments, and may be especially prevalent among veterans with PTSD. Effective anger management therapies exist but may be undermined by poor engagement or lack of treatment availability. Finding ways to engage veterans in anger management therapy or to improve access can be helpful in improving clinical outcomes. This randomized controlled trial compared anger management treatment (AMT) with AMT augmented by a mobile application (app) system, Remote Exercises for Learning Anger and Excitation Management (RELAX). METHODS: Participants were 58 veterans enrolled in 12 sessions of either AMT alone or AMT with the RELAX system (AMT + RELAX). The RELAX system includes the RELAX app, a wearable heart rate monitor, a remote server, and a web‐based therapist interface. RELAX allows the user to practice skills, monitor symptoms, and record physiological data. The server collects data on app use. A web‐based interface allows the therapist to access data on between‐session practice, and skills use. Measures administered at baseline, post‐treatment, and 3‐and 6‐month follow‐up include state and trait anger, dimensions of anger, PTSD, depression, interpersonal functioning, and satisfaction. We used multilevel modeling to account for the nesting of time points within participants and participants within treatment groups. Predictors were Treatment Condition (AMT + RELAX and AMT), Linear Time (baseline, post‐treatment, 3‐and 6‐month follow‐up), and Quadratic Time and Treatment Condition × Linear Time interaction. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 21 (Armonk, New York). Approval was obtained from the institutional review board. RESULTS: Across groups, the treatment dropout rate was 13.8%; of those who remained in treatment, 90% received an adequate dose of treatment (10 or more sessions). There were no significant differences between groups on attendance or treatment completion. Participants in both treatments demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in anger severity and significant post‐treatment reductions in PTSD. Veterans did not report significant changes in depression or interpersonal functioning. Veterans in the AMT + RELAX group reported spending significantly less time on homework assignments, and they rated the AMT + RELAX app as helpful and easy to use, with these ratings improving over time. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that AMT + RELAX was beneficial in reducing anger symptoms and promoting efficient use of the between‐session practice; however, AMT + RELAX did not outperform AMT. This study is an important contribution as it is one of the first randomized controlled trials to study the efficacy of a technology‐enhanced, evidence‐based psychotherapy for anger management. Findings are limited because of small sample size and modifications to the technology during the trial. However, the results highlight the possible benefits of mobile app‐supported treatment, including increasing the accessibility of treatment, lowering therapist workload, reducing costs of treatment, reducing practice time, and enabling new activities and types of treatments. This study presents preliminary evidence that mobile apps can be a valuable addition to treatment for patients with anger difficulties. Future research should evaluate how much therapist involvement is needed to support anger management.

KY: Psychotic Disorders; Schizophrenia
AB: Cognitive remediation (CR) is an evidence‐based practice to treat the pervasive and significant cognitive deficits that contribute to functional decline in schizophrenia. The New York State Office of Mental Health (OMH) has teamed with the Principal Investigator to be the first, and largest state system of care to implement a statewide program of CR tied to recovery programming. Through Cognitive Remediation to Promote Recovery (CR2PR), CR is now offered in outpatient programs throughout the state, with plans to expand to more services and further adapt implementation to improve treatment outcomes. To proceed systematically, this project will work directly with CR2PR programs, guided by practice‐based evidence gathered during CR2PR to build upon and improve current CR delivery methods in two ways. 1. Ongoing program evaluation indicates that the burden of attending clinic twice per week for CR limits the number of people who enroll. This project will test the feasibility and collect preliminary data on the effectiveness of personalized CR delivery that involves one clinic visit and one remote session per week. Demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating remotely delivered CR would double the number of patients who could access the OMH CR program and reduce treatment costs. 2. Current effect sizes for cognition and functional outcomes may remain limited if personalization, mechanisms of action, and relevant targets are not better addressed. Given evidence that early auditory information processing ability (EAP) works as a neurobehavioral marker of need for sensory processing training, this study will test the potential to use baseline EAP assessment to tailor CR, incorporating EAP with other cognitive skills training as clinically indicated. The ultimate goal of integrating scalable assessment practices to personalize CR is to improve recovery outcomes. The study will use a repeated measures, randomized design. Eligible participants who are referred to CR2PR will complete a routine baseline neurocognitive assessment with the addition of a EAP measure, and will then be randomized to either all‐clinic CR (Clinic) or clinic+remote (Hybrid) CR. The Clinic research arm consists of 30 sessions delivered twice weekly in a group format of up to 8 participants with rolling admission. The Hybrid condition consists of 15 clinic sessions in the above format, and independent homework on cognitive exercises for 60 minutes per week for 15 weeks using a laptop, PC or tablet available to them. All clinic sessions consist of 45 minutes of working on 3‐4 computerized exercises selected by a clinician from a menu of web‐based programs to improve the cognitive functions identified as impaired on the assessment. Computer exercises are followed by 15 minute manualized discussion groups based on the concept of "Bridging". All participants will complete a treatment satisfaction survey and will be re‐tested on outcome measures approximately 1 week following end of treatment. Additional data on the feasibility and acceptability of the Hybrid approach will be gathered through a qualitative interview with participants at treatment endpoint.

AB: INTERVENTION: There will be two sets of material and the participants will be randomly assigned to one or the other group. CBM‐pa consists of 40 scenarios in each session (six weekly sessions), for a total of 240 different scenarios. The exercises involved will be interactive; for each CBM‐pa scenario, participants will have to read three lines on a computer screen, completing missing words and answer questions about each scenario in a way that encourages more helpful beliefs about themselves and others. In the computerised text‐reading control condition participants will have exactly the same process, but will read a different scenario. The experience is identical, but content omits the active ingredient: resolution of an ambiguous situation in a benign/non‐paranoid manner. Instead control participants read and respond to factual material. The scenarios will be different for both the groups and as yet it is not known if there will be of any benefit to participants. If at the end of the study one procedure is found to be more helpful than the other in relieving paranoia, then anyone NOT allocated to that procedure will be offered the opportunity to receive it. Participants will receive postal/telephone 1 and 3 month follow‐up. Remote follow‐up is preferred to reduce costs and minimise attrition. All participants will be reimbursed for completing assessments (only), and will be given £10 for each of the 6 research assessments they attend. We will conduct this study following CONSORT guidelines. The King's Clinical Trials Unit will conduct double‐blind randomisation. CBM‐pa is self‐administered, allowing researchers to be blind to condition. Control and intervention are procedurally identical and previous studies' debriefing indicates participants cannot correctly guess their assigned condition. Here, participants and researchers will be asked to guess assigned condition to evaluate double‐blinding.

TI: Efficacy of a Coupler-based Fitting Approach for Experienced Users Receiving Replacement Hearing Aids
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03569228
YR: 2018
KY: Deafness; Hearing Loss
AB: In the VA system, hearing loss is the second‐most common service‐connected condition affecting 933,182 Veterans, exceeded only by tinnitus which affects 1,121,709 Veterans (data from Veterans Benefit Report for Fiscal Year 2016). In FY 2016, the VA dispensed 750,075 hearing aids at a net procurement of nearly $270 million (report generated from VA Denver Acquisition and Logistics Center [DALC] Remote Order Entry System [ROES]). Half of the hearing aids dispensed were to experienced hearing aid users receiving replacement hearing aids (Dennis, 2014). VA Audiology caseload is significant and Veterans can experience long wait‐times for fitting appointments to obtain new hearing aids (Office of the Inspector General, 2014). The purpose of the fitting appointment is to program and verify the hearing aids and orient the patient to hearing aid use/care. For patients obtaining replacement hearing aids, the orientation typically is unnecessary, and the programming is simplified; consisting mainly of matching the individual's real‐ear aided response (REAR) and hearing aid output to appropriate target values. In contrast to adults, REAR measurements are not well‐tolerated by children due to the requirement for placement of a probe tube in the ear canal. Therefore, a hearing aid fitting procedure that circumvents the need for in situ REAR measurements (real ear coupler difference or RECD) is the standard‐of‐care (SoC) for children. Considerable research clearly has shown the equivalency of in situ REAR and RECD fitting procedures (e.g., Moodie et al., 1994). RECD fitting procedures rarely are used with adults; however, such an approach could preclude the need for direct physical contact with the patient at the time of the hearing aid fitting. Three experiments are proposed. The purpose of the first study is to evaluate coupler‐based fitting approach for groups of experienced users obtaining replacement hearing aids and compare the accuracy of those fittings to the prescription and their outcomes to norms. The second study aims to develop correction factors for venting of open‐fit hearing aids. The third study will focus on comparing coupler‐based fittings of open‐fit hearing aids (using correction factors developed from study two results) to an SoC (active control) group who will have their open‐fit hearing aids fitted in face‐to‐face appointment via standard in situ REAR procedures. In Study 1 and 3, both groups will return for in situ REARs and self‐report outcomes assessment one month after the hearing‐aid fitting. The results of this study should determine the efficacy of a RECD‐based, hearing‐aid fitting approach for experienced hearing‐aid users who are receiving replacement hearing aids consisting of a variety of styles. If the approaches are equivalent, then this study will provide an evidence‐based, RECD fitting approach that should result in greater patient satisfaction and reduced costs.

AB: BACKGROUND: Most adults undergoing cardiac surgery suffer from moderate to severe pain for up to 6 days after surgery. Individual barriers and attitudes regarding pain and its relief make patients reluctant to report their pain and ask for analgesic medication, which results in inadequate pain management. More innovative educational interventions for postoperative pain relief are needed. We developed a Web‐based nursing intervention to influence patient's involvement in postoperative pain management. The intervention (SOULAGE‐TAVIE) includes a preoperative 30‐minute Web‐based session and 2 brief face‐to‐face postoperative booster sessions. The Web application generates reflective activities and tailored educational messages according to patients' beliefs and attitudes. The messages are transmitted through videos of a virtual nurse, animations, stories, and texts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this single‐blinded pilot randomized trial was to investigate the preliminary effects of a virtual nursing intervention (SOULAGE‐TAVIE) to improve pain relief in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Participants (N = 60) were adults scheduled for their first cardiac surgery. They were randomly assigned to the experimental group using SOULAGE‐TAVIE (n = 30) or the control group using usual care, including an educational pamphlet and postoperative follow‐up (n = 30). Data were collected through questionnaires at the time of admission and from day 1 to day 7 after surgery with the help of a blinded research assistant. Outcomes were pain intensity, pain interference with daily activities, patients' pain barriers, tendency to catastrophize in face of pain, and analgesic consumption. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable at baseline across all demographic measures. Results revealed that patients in the experimental group did not experience less intense pain, but they reported significantly less pain interference when breathing/coughing (P = .04). A severe pain interference with breathing/coughing (pain ranked ≥ 7/10) was reported on day 3 after surgery by 15% of the patients in the experimental group (4/27), as compared to 44% (7/16) in the control group. On day 7 after surgery, participants in the experimental group also exhibited fewer pain‐related barriers as measured by the Barriers Questionnaire‐II (mean 10.6, SD 8.3) than patients in the control group (mean 15.8, SD 7.3, P = .02). No difference was found for pain catastrophizing. However, in both groups, means revealed a lower tendency to catastrophize pain before surgery as measured by the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (control group mean 1.04, SD 0.74; experimental group mean 1.10, SD 0.95) and after surgery (control group mean score 1.19, SD 0.94; experimental group mean score 1.08, SD 0.99). Finally, the experimental group consumed more opioid medication (mean 31.2 mg, SD 23.2) than the control group (mean 18.8 mg, SD 15.3, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study provides promising results to support the benefits of this new Web‐tailored approach that can increase accessibility to health education and promote pain relief without generating more costs.

AB: BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) has beneficial effects on sequelae and recurrence of cancer and co‐morbidities in prostate (PCa) and colorectal (CRC) cancer. Nevertheless, most patients do not meet PA‐guidelines. Since a majority of patients reports a need for PA information or easily accessible PA counselling we aimed to develop the Onco‐ Active+ intervention. The main objective of this e‐ Health PA intervention is to increase and maintain PA in PCa and CRC patients both during and after treatment. METHOD: We conducted a qualitative study with patients and professionals to provide input for the development of the OncoActive+ intervention. Semi‐structured interviews with PCa and CRC patients were conducted to gain insight into PA behaviour and experiences with cancer, (physical) barriers, PA counselling and information needs and preferences. In‐depth interviews with professionals (including medical specialists, oncology nurses, physiotherapists, physiologists and cancer‐ related PA group coaches) were conducted to gain insight in the feasibility of PA during and after treatment, special considerations and (physical) barriers, PA determinants and important aspects of the intervention. Interviews were audiotaped and analysed. RESULTS: Interviews with patients (n = 27) and professionals (n = 15) provided valuable input for the development of the OncoActive+ intervention such as PA benefits (e.g., improve physical fitness, getting mind off of cancer) and (physical) difficulties (e.g., fatigue, incontinence, lack of motivation) that patients experienced during and after treatment. PA counselling with tailored advice, providing specific PA options and mentioning PA benefits were mentioned as important elements of a PA intervention. Professionals provided several practical suggestions such as using graphics, mobile apps, social media and referral to health professionals. Detailed results of the interviews, the developed intervention and pretest results will be presented. CONCLUSIONS: The insights into the PA behaviour, the associated difficulties and benefits, and the counselling and information needs during cancer treatment and recovery that were obtained from the qualitative interviews were used to develop the OncoActive+ intervention (based on the proven effective Active+ PA‐intervention). Since both patients and professionals were included in the development, this easy accessible e‐ Health PA intervention is assumed to meet PA counselling and information needs of PCa and CRC patients both during and after treatment. The intervention will be further evaluated in a pilot study and a randomised controlled trial (RCT). RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: The current study provides insight in the specific PA needs and experiences of PCa and CRC patients, which are relevant for the development of PA interventions. The OncoActive+ intervention was developed based on these insights. The evaluation of this intervention in the form of a pilot study and RCT will provide information on its feasibility and its effects on PA, health outcomes (e.g., health related quality of life, fatigue) and appreciation of the intervention. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: PA is beneficial for cancer patients both during and after treatment. By providing an easy accessible intervention to stimulate cancer survivors to increase their PA, OncoActive+ has the potential to enhance the health and quality of life of cancer survivors. Since OncoActive+ is based on computer‐tailoring, it has the potential to easily provide a large population with an individual PA advice with low (personnel) costs, and is therefore low in demand for health care providers.

AB: Objectives: Heart failure (HF) affects many people worldwide, and it is generally expected that the number of people with HF will increase because of the aging population and better survival rates of patients after a myocardial infarction. Readmission rates usually vary between 25% and 50% within 6 months after the first hospitalization for HF and account for approximately 70% of the costs. Despite efforts to improve outcomes in heart failure (HF), readmission rates remain relatively high. Reasons for readmission from different perspectives (patient, caregiver, health care providers) may help to optimize the future management of patients with HF. The aims of this study are to :1) gain insight into reasons for HF readmission from the perspective of patients, caregivers, cardiologists, and HF nurses; 2) examine similarities and differences in perspectives on the reason for an HF readmission, and 3) describe possibilities to prevent an HF readmission from different perspectives. Methods: A descriptive design was used with data from a substudy of the Coordinating study evaluating Outcomes of Advising and Counseling in Heart failure (COACH), a multicenter study on the effects of education and counseling in HF. Between November 2010 and May 2013, 918 patients from the first hospiltal of Jilin Univercity were included in the COACH study. Inclusion criteria were hospitalization for symptomatic HF, confirmed by the cardiologist, and underlying heart disease as the cause of HF. Exclusion criteria were an invasive intervention within the last 6 months or planned in the next 3 months, participation in a study requiring additional visits to a research nurse, and evaluation for heart transplantation. After written informed consent to participate in the study, patients were followed for a period of 18 months. Patients were randomized to 1 of 3 study groups: basic support, intensive support, or control. Results: Data on reasons for readmission were collected on 173 readmissions. Perspectives of patients, caregivers, cardiologists, and HF nurses were collected by interview and questionnaire. Worsening HF as the sole reason for readmission was reported most often; however, 36% of caregivers, 56% of patients, and 63% to 65% of health care providers indicated that other factors, such as comorbidity, nonadherence, and nonoptimal medication, were important contributing factors. In only 34% of readmissions, patients and their caregivers agreed with health care providers on the underlying reason. Respondents reported that 23% to 31% of the readmissions could probably have been prevented if adherence were higher, patients requested help earlier, and adequate multidisciplinary professional help were available. Conclusions: Firstly, to prevent future readmissions of patients with HF, it is important to fully understand the reasons for readmission by gaining insight on the reason for readmission from different perspectives. Adding information from different perspectives provides a complete picture of reasons for the adverse outcome. Secondly, we may need another approach to prevent adverse outcomes in which other medical problems and new strategies, such as telemedicine or other home‐based interventions to improve adherence have to be considered. Finally, insufficient professional help, nonadherence, and knowledge deficit were reported moreoften in the control group as a precipitating factor for readmission than in the intensive treatment group.

AB: Low back pain (LBP) affects up to 85% of the adult population imposing an economic burden of $86 billion annually or 1% of the US gross domestic product. Traditionally, acute spinal pain has been considered as self‐resolving with chronic low back pain (pain > 3 months duration) only accounting for 5% of those individuals with low back pain. Though, more recent literature has contested this view point by citing that between one‐third and two‐thirds of those patients with acute spinal pain do not improve, but instead transition to chronic pain. Thus, determining and using efficacious interventions for low back pain may prevent or improve the disability associated with chronic low back disorders. One viable treatment option for low back pain is spinal manipulative therapy (SMT). However, insufficient evidence exists to explain the mechanisms of pain reduction and improved function associated with SMT, although SMT appears to be an advocated intervention for managing low back pain patients. If the biological mechanisms of SMT were understood, clinicians could determine a priori which patients may respond to SMT, perhaps improving clinical outcomes and reducing health care costs. Thus, our study sought to improve the understanding of the biological mechanisms associated with spinal manipulation. This pilot project involved a prospective, randomized, single‐blinded clinical trial of 3‐week spinal manipulative therapy in individuals with chronic non‐specific low back pain (CNSLBP). We enrolled and randomly assigned 29 subjects (n = 29) to spinal manipulation (SMT) or sham spinal manipulation (sham SMT) groups. After group allocation, we conducted testing including pressure pain threshold (PPT) and kinematic analyses (angular displacement and velocity), along with clinical outcomes (Numeric Pain Rating Scale and Oswestry Disability Index). This is the first study that demonstrates the effect of SMT on PPT at local, regional, and remote testing sites in chronic low back patients. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that SMT and sham SMT can lead to significant improvements in pain and patient‐reported disability along with trunk kinematics in CNSLBP patients. Though not significant, the SMT group showed more favorable improvements in trunk angular displacement in the SMT group than the sham SMT group at 3‐weeks post‐intervention. It is therefore recommended to use the standard SMT in the clinical setting, even though some technique variations may influence trunk kinematics. Lastly, our results indicated that the relationship between SMT‐induced changes in biological outcome measures appears limited. Results of this study support the use of SMT or its variation in patients with CNSLBP. Furthermore, the specific technique of how spinal manipulation is conducted may be less important, as long as a mechanical load is applied to the spine. Overall, the presented work stipulates acquiescent evidence that SMT is an effective intervention in patients with CNSLBP. Nevertheless, further study with a larger sample size and longer‐term outcome is required to better appreciate the biological mechanisms associated with SMT.

AB: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative illness affecting approximately 1.5 million Americans and is the 14th leading cause of death in the United States. PD is traditionally described as a movement disorder with characteristic motor symptoms (e.g. tremor). However, more recent research demonstrates the impact of nonmotor symptoms such as pain, depression, and dementia on mortality, quality of life (QOL), nursing home placement and caregiver distress. Regarding models of care for PD, evidence suggests that care including a neurologist results in lower mortality and nursing home placement than care solely from a primary care physician. Unfortunately, there is also significant evidence that many of the needs most important to PD patients and their caregivers (e.g. depression, planning for the future) are poorly addressed under current models of care. Palliative care is an approach to caring for individuals with life‐threatening illnesses that focuses on addressing potential causes of suffering including physical and psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial issues and spiritual needs. While developed for cancer patients, palliative care approaches have been successfully applied in other chronic progressive illnesses including heart failure and pulmonary disease. To date there have been minimal attempts to apply these principles to PD although evidence suggests that PD patients' unmet needs under current models of care may be amenable to palliative care. A small but growing cadre of centers offer outpatient palliative care for PD with early evidence of efficacy and a randomized trial of an academic‐based outpatient palliative care is underway led by investigators on this proposal. While this work is critical to forwarding this field, further work is needed to provide a model that can be widely disseminated. The current proposal addresses this gap by assessing the effectiveness and feasibility of a novel community‐based intervention that empowers community neurology practices to improve care for PD patients and caregivers through palliative care training, coaching and telemedicine resources. The investigators hypothesize that this intervention will improve patient QOL and caregiver burden and will prove feasible and acceptable to community providers. The investigators Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine the a) effectiveness and b) feasibility of a novel community‐based outpatient palliative care intervention for PD.; 2) Describe the effects of a this intervention on patient and caregiver costs and service utilization; and 3) Identify opportunities to optimize community‐based palliative care for this population by: a) describing patient and caregiver characteristics associated with intervention benefits; and b) through direct patient, caregiver and provider interviews. Innovations of the investigators approach include a novel model of providing disease‐specific community‐based palliative care not dependent on limited palliative specialist resources, a stepped‐wedge trial design and use of telemedicine resources to provide multidisciplinary care. The research is significant because it will create a foundation for future community‐based dissemination studies in PD and the broader field of palliative care.

AB: BACKGROUND: Asthma is the most common pediatric illness in the United States, burdening low‐income and minority families disproportionately and contributing to high health care costs. Clinic‐based asthma education and telephone case management have had mixed results on asthma control, as have eHealth programs and online games. OBJECTIVES: To test the effects of (1) CHESS+CM, a system for parents and children ages 4‐12 years with poorly controlled asthma, on asthma control and medication adherence, and (2) competence, self‐efficacy, and social support as mediators. CHESS+CM included a fully automated eHealth component (Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System [CHESS]) plus monthly nurse case management (CM) via phone. CHESS, based on self‐determination theory, was designed to improve competence, social support, and intrinsic motivation of parents and children. METHODS: We identified eligible parent‐child dyads from files of managed care organizations in Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA, sent them recruitment letters, and randomly assigned them (unblinded) to a control group of treatment as usual plus asthma information or to CHESS+CM. Asthma control was measured by the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and self‐reported symptom‐free days. Medication adherence was a composite of pharmacy refill data and medication taking. Social support, information competence, and self‐efficacy were self‐assessed in questionnaires. All data were collected at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Asthma diaries kept during a 3‐week run‐in period before randomization provided baseline data. RESULTS: Of 305 parent‐child dyads enrolled, 301 were randomly assigned, 153 to the control group and 148 to CHESS+CM. Most parents were female (283/301, 94%), African American (150/301, 49.8%), and had a low income as indicated by child's Medicaid status (154/301, 51.2%); 146 (48.5%) were single and 96 of 301 (31.9%) had a high school education or less. Completion rates were 127 of 153 control group dyads (83.0%) and 132 of 148 CHESS+CM group dyads (89.2%). CHESS+CM group children had significantly better asthma control on the ACQ (d = ‐0.31, 95% confidence limits [CL] ‐0.56, ‐0.06, P = .011), but not as measured by symptom‐free days (d = 0.18, 95% CL ‐0.88, 1.60, P = 1.00). The composite adherence scores did not differ significantly between groups (d = 1.48%, 95% CL ‐8.15, 11.11, P = .76). Social support was a significant mediator for CHESS+CM's effect on asthma control (alpha = .200, P = .01; beta = .210, P = .03). Self‐efficacy was not significant (alpha = .080, P = .14; beta = .476, P = .01); neither was information competence (alpha = .079, P = .09; beta = .063, P = .64). CONCLUSIONS: Integrating telephone case management with eHealth benefited pediatric asthma control, though not medication adherence. Improved methods of measuring medication adherence are needed. Social support appears to be more effective than information in improving pediatric asthma control.

AB: The prevalence of obesity and diabetes in older adults has increased during the past 20 years and will increasingly affect medical and social services, as well as costs over time. Because older adults are often portrayed as less likely to change long‐standing health behaviors, health promotion in this age group has lagged behind others. In fact, little attention has been given to the importance of diabetes prevention and management in community‐dwelling older adults. A recent report of obesity diagnosis and care practice in the Veterans Health Administration showed that elderly patients were less likely to receive obesity‐related education or counseling [Noel 2010]. Intentional weight loss in obese older adults has not been widely advocated by health care providers due to the perceived uncertainty of whether the benefits outweigh the risks. There is also a need to overcome the barriers to provide appropriate interventions on blood pressure, glucose, and lipid management tailored to the functionality of older adults. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated the benefit of modest weight loss, through diet and exercise, on the reduction of diabetes risk in participants from all race/ethnic groups (58% overall reduction with a 71% reduction in the older population), leading to a delay of 4 years over a 10‐year period in the onset of diabetes among those that received lifestyle intervention [DPP 2002, DPP 2009]. The DPP is considered a landmark study in comparative effectiveness research (CER), but it has yet to be translated into widespread public health practice. South Florida provides a unique setting to accelerate the adoption of this CER evidence into practice and address the obesity and diabetes challenges of the aging population. There are more than 800,000 multi‐ethnic residents age 60 and over, many of whom have one or more chronic diseases [CDC 2008]. A large number of older veterans with or at high‐risk of diabetes currently receive care in the Miami VA Healthcare System. Compelling scientific evidence exists that lifestyle change delays the onset of type 2 diabetes in high‐risk persons. Lifestyle intervention can also lead to a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with type 2 diabetes [Look AHEAD research group 2007]. However, few older adults succeed in achieving intentional weight loss through healthy diet and increased physical activity. Furthermore, some have argued that the current US health system is not prepared to deliver lifestyle interventions [Narayan 2004]. Several issues related to integration of lifestyle intervention in clinical practice have been raised. Currently, it is unknown whether other practicing professionals could deliver interventions in the community with efficacy similar to that of the interventionists of the DPP, who were trained in counseling on nutrition, exercise, and behavior modification. The investigators propose the use of telemedicine with applications in an interactive web‐based system. This will allow participants to get just‐in‐time feedback from peers using targeted information on specific areas that need reinforcement to adopt healthy lifestyle and better self‐management skills by older veterans. This will bolster the peer‐participant interaction and make them more focused around areas where there are adoption gaps. This technology functions as a platform for social interaction that will lead to increase self‐efficacy and better health outcomes. The VA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP) developed the MOVE! weight management program based on the 1998/2000 Identification and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults Evidence Report. A major goal for the MOVE! program has been to reduce the prevalence of diabetes in veterans. Our long‐term goal is to reduce the burden of obesity‐related chronic diseases and promote healthy aging in older veterans through the implementation of best practices for prevention. The main objective of this project is to implement evidence‐informed, innovative interventions to increase adoption of findings from comparative effectiveness research (CER) for diabetes management prevention in South Florida older veterans.

AB: BACKGROUND: Automated eHealth Web‐based research trials offer people an accessible, confidential opportunity to engage in research that matters to them. eHealth trials may be particularly useful for sensitive issues when seeking health care may be accompanied by shame and mistrust. Yet little is known about people's early engagement with eHealth trials, from recruitment to preintervention autoregistration processes. A recent randomized controlled trial that tested the effectiveness of an eHealth safety decision aid for New Zealand women in the general population who experienced intimate partner violence (isafe) provided the opportunity to examine recruitment and preintervention participant engagement with a fully automated Web‐based registration process. The trial aimed to recruit 340 women within 24 months. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine participant preintervention engagement and recruitment efficiency for the isafe trial, and to analyze dropout through the registration pathway, from recruitment to eligibility screening and consent, to completion of baseline measures. METHODS: In this case study, data collection sources included the trial recruitment log, Google Analytics reports, registration and program metadata, and costs. Analysis included a qualitative narrative of the recruitment experience and descriptive statistics of preintervention participant engagement and dropout rates. A Koyck model investigated the relationship between Web‐based online marketing website advertisements (ads) and participant accrual. RESULTS: The isafe trial was launched on September 17, 2012. Placement of ads in an online classified advertising platform increased the average number of recruited participants per month from 2 to 25. Over the 23‐month recruitment period, the registration website recorded 4176 unique visitors. Among 1003 women meeting eligibility criteria, 51.55% (517) consented to participate; among the 501 women who enrolled (consented, validated, and randomized), 412 (82.2%) were accrued (completed baseline assessments). The majority (n=52, 58%) of the 89 women who dropped out between enrollment and accrual never logged in to the allocated isafe website. Of every 4 accrued women, 3 (314/412, 76.2%) identified the classified ad as their referral source, followed by friends and family (52/412, 12.6%). Women recruited through a friend or relative were more likely to self‐identify as indigenous Māori and live in the highest‐deprivation areas. Ads increased the accrual rate by a factor of 74 (95% CI 49‐112). CONCLUSIONS: Print advertisements, website links, and networking were costly and inefficient methods for recruiting participants to a Web‐based eHealth trial. Researchers are advised to limit their recruitment efforts to Web‐based online marketplace and classified advertising platforms, as in the isafe case, or to social media. Online classified advertising in "Jobs‐Other‐volunteers" successfully recruited a diverse sample of women experiencing intimate partner violence. Preintervention recruitment data provide critical information to inform future research and critical analysis of Web‐based eHealth trials.

AB: Background: Internet‐based interventions for smoking cessation could help millions of people stop smoking at very low unit costs; however, long‐term biochemically verified evidence is scarce and such interventions might be less effective for smokers with low socioeconomic status than for those with high status because of lower online literacy to engage with websites. We aimed to assess a new interactive internet‐based intervention (StopAdvisor) for smoking cessation that was designed with particular attention directed to people with low socioeconomic status. Methods: We did this online randomised controlled trial between Dec 6, 2011, and Oct 11, 2013, in the UK. Participants aged 18 years and older who smoked every day were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment with StopAdvisor or an information‐only website. Randomisation was automated with an unseen random number function embedded in the website to establish which treatment was revealed after the online baseline assessment. Recruitment continued until the required sample size had been achieved from both high and low socioeconomic status subpopulations. Participants, and researchers who obtained data and did laboratory analyses, were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was 6 month sustained, biochemically verified abstinence. The main secondary outcome was 6 month, 7 day biochemically verified point prevalence. Analysis was by intention to treat. Homogeneity of intervention effect across the socioeconomic subsamples was first assessed to establish whether overall or separate subsample analyses were appropriate. The study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN99820519. Findings: We randomly assigned 4613 participants to the StopAdvisor group (n=2321) or the control group (n=2292); 2142 participants were of low socioeconomic status and 2471 participants were of high status. The overall rate of smoking cessation was similar between participants in the StopAdvisor and control groups for the primary (237 [10%] vs 220 [10%] participants; relative risk [RR] 106, 95% CI 089‐127; p=049) and the secondary (358 [15%] vs 332 [15%] participants; 106, 093‐122; p=037) outcomes; however, the intervention effect differed across socioeconomic status subsamples (144, 099‐209; p=00562 and 137, 102‐184; p=00360, respectively). StopAdvisor helped participants with low socioeconomic status stop smoking compared with the information‐only website (primary outcome: 90 [8%] of 1088 vs 64 [6%] of 1054 participants; RR 136, 95% CI 100‐186; p=00499; secondary outcome: 136 [13%] vs 100 [10%] participants; 132, 103‐168, p=00267), but did not improve cessation rates in those with high socioeconomic status (147 [12%] of 1233 vs 156 [13%] of 1238 participants; 095, 077‐117; p=061 and 222 [18%] vs 232 [19%] participants; 096, 081‐113, p=064, respectively). Interpretation: StopAdvisor was more effective than an information‐only website in smokers of low, but not high, socioeconomic status. StopAdvisor could be implemented easily and made freely available, which would probably improve the success rates of smokers with low socioeconomic status who are seeking online support.

AB: BACKGROUND: Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death, and tobacco control professionals continue to make progress in cessation efforts. Pharmacists can assist smokers seeking to quit by offering counseling on smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. Pragmatic randomized trials are useful for investigating practical questions about an intervention's risks, benefits, and costs in routine clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an enhanced pharmacy care (EPC) program involving personalized pharmacist‐provided telephone counseling for supporting prescription smoking cessation medications compared with usual care (UC). METHODS: Cigarette smokers filling a newly prescribed smoking cessation pharmacotherapy and with pharmacy benefits managed by Express Scripts were recruited. Qualified subjects were randomized 1:1 to EPC and UC. Subjects in EPC received 3 telephone‐counseling sessions from specialist pharmacists during the early course of the study, while subjects in UC did not receive any counseling sessions. Study outcomes were collected through telephone contact and using the Express Scripts prescription database. The primary outcome assessed the 1‐week point prevalence (PP) of smoking abstinence at the end of the trial (week 12). Secondary outcomes included 4‐week PP at week 12 and adherence, evaluated by proportion of days covered (PDC), to prescribed smoking cessation pharmacotherapies. RESULTS: There were 1,017 randomized subjects. Among them, 1,002 subjects were included in the analysis, and 513 were randomized into EPC and 489 into UC. Baseline demographics, smoking history, and prescribed smoking cessation pharmacotherapies were comparable. Varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) were most frequently prescribed for smoking cessation. In EPC, 46.0% received all 3 counseling sessions; 29.4% received 2 sessions; and 14.6% received 1 session. Overall, 353 subjects in EPC and 383 subjects in UC completed the week 12 assessment. In the analysis for 1‐week PP of smoking abstinence at week 12, the percentage of abstainers in EPC was numerically higher than in UC (42.3% vs. 38.2%) with OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.96‐1.61. It was not statistically significant. Adherence to prescription smoking cessation medication was significantly higher in EPC versus UC (49.7% vs. 45.6%; P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated whether a telephone‐based pharmacy care program, provided by pharmacists and designed to support attempted quitters, improved quitting and increased adherence over usual care. The findings suggest that an enhanced program may benefit smokers by increasing prescription smoking cessation medication adherence. Future research should explore this program's effect on smokers who are compliant, based on insights on quitting provided by the post hoc analyses and limitations of the current study design.

TI: Effects of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Moderate PVD Patients A Pilot Randomized Control Trial
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02273232
YR: 2014
KY: Peripheral Arterial Disease; Peripheral Vascular Diseases
AB: Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a major health problem, affecting approximately 20% of adults over 55 years of age and about 27 million people in North America and Europe . Most PVD is asymptomatic. Intermittent claudication is the typical clinical manifestation, developing in about 5% men aged 60 years and increases with age . For every patient with symptomatic PAD there are another three to four subjects in general population with PVD who do not meet the clinical criteria for intermittent claudication [4] . There are no precise figures for PVD's health economic impact in Ireland. In the United States, the estimated total cost of PVD exceeds $21 billion annually . Current treatment options for non‐lifestyle limiting claudication include watchful waiting, medical management, exercise training, endovascular treatment and surgical reconstruction with uncertainty regarding the optimal approach in many patients. PVD patients usually have multiple co‐morbidities. Decisions regarding optimal management seek to balance the risk of intervention in patients with multiple co‐morbidities, the likely benefit in terms of symptom relief and quality of life and the overall life‐expectancy of these patients . There is a need for safer, non‐invasive interventions which are cost‐effective and acceptable to patients. Ischemic preconditioning was first described by Murry et al, almost 30 years ago when he observed that protection was conferred on ischemic myocardium by preceding brief periods of sub lethal ischemia separated by periods of reperfusion . Subsequent experiments demonstrated that brief periods of ischemia‐reperfusion in any tissue conferred protection on any other tissue exposed to a significant ischemic insult. For example, brief periods of skeletal muscle ischemia‐reperfusion confers protection on the heart. This phenomenon is referred to as remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) Clinical trials in cardiac surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention suggest that RIPC reduces cardiac injury, critical care stay and inotropes use. However, the effects of preconditioning in peripheral vascular disease patients remain largely un evaluated, apart from some small studies on symptomatic relief and the exercise induced preconditioning effect . Remote preconditioning affects blood supply in other limbs. Enko et al demonstrated that intermittent arm ischemia by applying 3 cycles of 200mmHg pressure for 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion produced dilatation of the contralateral brachial artery in healthy individuals. In a more recent study, Karakyoun et al evaluated RIPC and direct preconditioning in a rat model of critical limb ischemia. Iliac artery ligation was used to create critical limb ischemia in the rats. Both direct preconditioning (intermittent tourniquet application in the ischemic limb) and RIPC (intermittent tourniquet application on the contralateral leg) produced significant increases in perfusion and microvasculature density in the ischemic limb with true new blood vessels formation in both direct the IC and RIPC groups . The investigators hypothesize that remote preconditioning as an adjunct to exercise therapy or alone could stimulate greater microvessel formation in the legs of claudication patients, improving clinical outcomes in terms of symptoms and delayed complications. It may provide a new non‐invasive option for PVD patients. Sampling Frame All peripheral vascular disease patients referred to UCHG (University Collage Hospital Galway) OPD (Out Patients) in addition to inpatients during trial period will be actively searched to identify medical profiles which fulfill the trial criteria. Recruitment for the trial will be stopped at 15 months of 24 months' time frame. Trial Design Patients referred to vascular service OPDs (out patients) with claudication symptoms for the first time are usually assessed a by consultant or specialty registrar. Further investigations and course of management depends mainly on their symptoms and co morbidities. Many end up with diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease. From this group in addition to in patients group those with moderate peripheral vascular disease i.e., Rutherford stage 2 and Fontaine stage 2a. Will be recruited The target number will be 40 patients divided into 4 groups. All groups candidate will undergo base line assessment which include history, examination, MRA and ABIs. The candidates will be randomized into: Supervised Exercise Group: All PVD patients will get the standard advice regarding exercises but this group will have a constructed exercise program under supervision of Dr. Micheál Newell who is qualified Sports and Exercise Scientist with a Doctorate degree in Integrated Biology. This include six minute walk test, Chair Stand Test and symptoms free distance. RIPC and supervised Exercise Group: This group will have structured intermittent periods of induced remote ischemic preconditioning using standard blood pressure cuffs. The cuff will be applied for 5 minutes alternatively with 5 minutes rest to the total of 4 cycles, which needs 40 minutes per day. The RIPC group will receive an exercise program identical to the first group. The total number of days for each participant will be 30 days. RIPC with Standard Care Group: The patients in this group will receive standard care advice regarding exercise in addition to RIPC as in the 2nd group. Control Group (Standard Care): This group will get the standard advice regarding exercise for PVD patients and all the information available in OPD settings. Sample Size: The trial will be a pilot study to obtain preliminary data and evaluate the need for full‐scale trial hence there is no human trial in this particular area so far. The initial target will be 40 patients distributed in 4 groups of 10 patient each. Randomization Age and DM (Diabetes Mellitus ) are associated with many comorbidities. Randomization will be stratified for these two confounders. All trial candidates will have unique numbers to identify them and conceal their identity. Patients files will be locked in trial office with one person access and each candidate will get their numbers in sequential way according to their allocation. Projected recruitment Galway University hospital provides vascular services for a population of approximately 750000 served by the West‐North West Hospitals Group. The patients for the trial will be actively recruited from out patients clinics, in patients and GP clinics by sending letters to GPs ( General practitioners ) about the trial. Information about the trial will be given to all vascular team including criteria for selection and exclusion. Those who qualified will be counselled by the trial team and consented if the agree to join. The target of 40 patients should be achievable within the recruitment window. Patient recruitment & consent Eligible candidates will be given all the information about the trial in written and verbal explanation for all the steps. Patients who are willing to take part will be asked to provide written informed consent. Three copies of the consent form will be signed: one for the patient, one for the patient's clinical notes file and a one copy for the patient's trial folder. Data collection Demographic and clinical data of eligible candidates who agree to participate will be collected. The candidates will be assign a trial number identifier after informed consent is signed and no personal information will be available on the data entry sheets. The original data‐entry proforma will be retained together with a copy of the consent form in the trial office with other trial documents in the trial office in CSI( Clinical Science Institute) building. The code key for the trial numbers will be limited to the Chief Investigator. Encrypted back up copy will be prepared at the end of each data entry and will be kept looked separately. All data will be retained in the care of the principal investigator for a period of five years from the closure of the trial. Statistical analysis The statistical analysis with respect to the primary and secondary outcomes will be performed by a trial team member blinded to trial allocation. The cost‐effectiveness analysis will be performed under the supervision of the trial health‐economist (to be confirmed). This is a pilot study the results will identify if there is a need for larger trial. Trial monitoring Day‐to‐day management of the trial will be the responsibility of the trial manager, supervised by the principal investigator. A meeting will be held every two weeks between the trial manager and the principal investigator to monitor recruitment, data collection etc.

AB: Background: In the USA there is a national initiative in healthcare to decrease hospital readmissions, decrease the cost of care while patients are hospitalized and to increase patient. A recent study evaluating mortality rates in the lung cancer resection patients reported a 30‐ day readmission was associated with a 6‐fold increase in the 90‐day mortality of this patient population (14.4% vs 2.5%). This report not only forces thoracic surgery teams to extend their operative mortality focus and reporting beyond the traditional 30‐day time period but it also emphasizes the critical value and positive impact continued post‐operative care for the first three months after discharge can have on patient outcomes. The expert care delivered by thoracic surgery nurses plays a critical role in decreasing post‐operative complications and ensuring patients are safely discharged from the hospital. The valuable impact thoracic surgery nurses have on preventing hospital readmissions and improving patient satisfaction is the intended focus of this clinical trial. The positive impact telehealth interventions have on multiple different disease processes supports investigation of this care modality for the thoracic surgery patient population. We have designed a clinical trial focused on implementing a TeleNursing program with the specific aims of preventing hospital readmissions and improving patient satisfaction. Methods: Our thoracic surgery practice currently has a “day‐after‐discharge” follow‐up phone call program that is directed by the thoracic surgery nurses in the practice. Pertinent clinical details of each patient's post‐operative course are relayed to the thoracic surgery nurses. The nurses call patients 2‐3 days after discharge and asked questions related to medications, pain management, sign or symptoms of infection, activity level and expectations, sleep, appetite and general understanding of all discharge instructions. This interaction is documented in the electronic medical record. This program has been expanded to compare the efficacy of the phone calls vs scheduled video‐calls between nurses and patients. Patients are randomized to standard of care day after discharge phone calls vs the TeleNursing follow‐up video‐call; discharge day 2, 1‐month, 2‐month and 3‐ month. All patients complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire at predetermined time points. The primary objective is to decrease hospital readmission rates and the secondary objective is to improve patient satisfaction. Results: Although the results of this clinical trial are pending, interim analysis indicates that patients are willing to participate in this program and are pleased with the nurse‐patient interaction beyond their hospital stay. Conclusion: This clinical investigation is ongoing.

AB: INTERVENTION: Patients will be recruited into either surgery for standard robotic surgery (Group A) or surgery supplemented by CTM (Group B), where surgeons from connected hospitals will mentor chosen stages, that will be agreed and planned before the day of surgery. At no point will patients undergo surgery in a hospital that does not have the ability to independently complete the robotic surgery. All mentors must have completed at least 50 specific cases to qualify. Experience is graded level: 1) 50‐100 cases 2) 100‐250 cases 3) >250 cases. Mentees will be defined in two groups: A) an SpR trainee or fellow on a rotation attached to the hospital for a period of one year or more or a consultant in post with experience of less than 50 robotic cases. These mentees will be involved in assessment of standard RARP or standard RARC with extended pelvic lymph node dissection. B) An experienced robotic surgeon with experience of >50 cases who is learning a more sophisticated approach or technique e.g. RAPN incorporating a zero ischaemia technique or robotic intracorporeal neobladder. Once mentors and mentees have been identified and paired for the relevant procedures, the mentee will be given a DVD with the operation broken down into the various stages and subsequent steps within each stage. The mentee will study the DVD and then there will be a planned teleconference via Skype video link (or equivalent) between the mentor and the mentee so that any issues or queries can be answered prior to commencing the surgery. CONDITION: Urological cancer surgery ; Surgery ; Malignant neoplasms of urinary tract PRIMARY OUTCOME: 1. Operation time, broken down into defined stages ‐ these will be measured at the time of the operation and recorded.; 2. Effect of CTM on learning curve defined outcomes SECONDARY OUTCOME: 1. Positive surgical margin rates. ‐ these will be recorded within 3 months from histology; 2. Lymph Node (LN) yields.‐ these will be recorded within 3 months from histology; 3. Functional outcomes (continence and erectile dysfunction rates). Will be measured at 3, 6 and 12 months.; 4. Blood loss ‐ will be recorded at time of the operation.; 5. Complication rates using Clavien classification ‐ will be recorded at 30 days and 90 days; 6. Conversion rates: conversion to open surgery (as an indicator of technical difficulty). Conversion is defined as the need to use a laparotomy wound for any reason other than specimen retrieval ‐ will be recorded at time of surgery.; 7. Cost analysis of reduced learning curves ‐ these results will come from the analysis of the times taken to complete the operations. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Male or female aged =18 years 2. Able to provide written informed consent 3. Diagnosis of urological cancer amenable to curative surgery

AB: Objective: Telemedicine system for chronic disease management is being proposed in many countries since many years. These systems impact the patient behaviour, medication‐taking, and important physician behaviours: promoting medication regimen adherence in patients and appropriately modifying therapy when existing therapy results in inadequate therapeutic effect. We recently launched a multicentre, prospective, cross‐sectional study, aimed to evaluate whether a home telehealth system that allows the patient to monitor blood pressure (BP) and blood glucose (BG), with remote educational support and feedback to the general practitioner, can improve BP control and other risk factors, metabolic control, overall cardiovascular risk and medication adherence in hypertensive individuals, as compared to usual practice. Design and method: 300 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and who are followed by primary care physicians will be randomized to either a “usual care group” or a “telemedicine group”. Participants will receive validated electronic BP and BG measuring device connected through GPRS (FORA DUO ultima D40 g). They will self‐test BP, BG and results will be uploaded and transmitted directly via a home telehealth system to a central database. Transferred data are integrated in the patient's file in “e‐CoreLab system” and will be available to the center team. Abnormal 1 week adjustable mean values for BP and BG will be notifed and relevant abnormalities will trigger an alarm which will be sent to the investigator by SMS or e‐mail. A virtual visit (phone call or video) will take place at least every 2 weeks, according to the alert trigger and objective deviation in the group receiving the pharmacological treatment with Telehealth Solution. Clinical examination, biology assessment and 24 hour Ambulatory BP Monitoring (BP‐Lab® or Mobil‐graph®) will be done at baseline and during the follow‐up period (6 months). Results: Results are expected to be available by 2018. Conclusions: We hypothesize that more subjects in the telemedicine group will achieve BP and BG goals than in the control group. This will occur through increases in knowledge, self‐management, shared decision‐making, and improved doctor‐patient interaction. We believe that telemedicine can facilitate patient care and in a cost effective manner.

AB: Background: Audiovisual streaming technologies allow detailed remote patient assessment and have been suggested to change management and enhance triage. The advent of wearable, head‐mounted devices (HMDs) permits advanced teletoxicology at a relatively low cost. A previously published pilot study supports the feasibility of using the HMD Google Glass (Google Inc.; Mountain View, CA) for teletoxicology consultation. This study examines the reliability, accuracy, and precision of the poisoned patient assessment when performed remotely via Google Glass. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study was performed on 50 patients admitted to a tertiary care center inpatient toxicology service. Toxicology fellows wore Google Glass and transmitted secure, real‐time video and audio of the initial physical examination to a remote investigator not involved in the subject's care. High‐resolution still photos of electrocardiograms (ECGs) were transmitted to the remote investigator. On‐site and remote investigators recorded physical examination findings and ECG interpretation. Both investigators completed a brief survey about the acceptability and reliability of the streaming technology for each encounter. Kappa scores and simple agreement were calculated for each examination finding and electrocardiogram parameter. Reliability scores and reliability difference were calculated and compared for each encounter. Results: Data were available for analysis of 17 categories of examination and ECG findings. Simple agreement between on‐site and remote investigators ranged from 68 to 100 % (median = 94 %, IQR = 10.5). Kappa scores could be calculated for 11/17 parameters and demonstrated slight to fair agreement for two parameters and moderate to almost perfect agreement for nine parameters (median = 0.653; substantial agreement). The lowest Kappa scores were for pupil size and response to light. On a 100‐mm visual analog scale (VAS), mean comfort level was 93 and mean reliability rating was 89 for on‐site investigators. For remote users, the mean comfort and reliability ratings were 99 and 86, respectively. The average difference in reliability scores between on‐site and remote investigators was 2.6, with the difference increasing as reliability scores decreased. Conclusion: Remote evaluation of poisoned patients via Google Glass is possible with a high degree of agreement on examination findings and ECG interpretation. Evaluation of pupil size and response to light is limited, likely by the quality of streaming video. Users of Google Glass for teletoxicology reported high levels of comfort with the technology and found it reliable, though as reported reliability decreased, remote users were most affected. Further study should compare patient‐centered outcomes when using HMDs for consultation to those resulting from telephone consultation. Copyright © 2016, American College of Medical Toxicology.

AB: Background: Remote patient monitoring of heart failure patients has been shown to improve health outcomes. However, the efficacy of a mobile phone‐based remote monitoring system is unknown. The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to determine the effects of mobile phonebased remote monitoring on heart failure management. Methods: The remote monitoring (RM) group (N=50) took daily weight and blood pressure readings, weekly single‐lead ECGs, and answered daily symptom questions on a mobile phone for 6 months. Readings were automatically transmitted wirelessly to the mobile phone and then to data servers. Alerts were sent to the patients and clinicians as required. The control (SC) group (N=50) was provided with standard of care. Paired Student t‐tests and Wilcoxon signed‐rank tests (for normally and not normally distributed data, respectively) were performed on baseline and post‐study blood tests and survey responses. Results: Approximately 70% of RM patients completed at least 80% of their daily readings over the 6 months. The Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) blood tests improved significantly only for the RM group (decrease of 178 pg/mL, p=.001) once the effect of the clinic was reduced by removing the patients who were enrolled into the clinic for less than 6 months (35 out of 100 participants). Quality of life measured with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire also improved only for the RM group (decrease of 14 points, p=.02) using all patient data. Self‐care maintenance (p=.05) and management (p=.03) measured with the Self‐Care of Heart Failure Index had an improvement for only the RM group after removing new patients in the analysis. No differences were found between the RM and SC groups in terms of hospitalization or emergency department visits. Conclusion: Mobile phone‐based remote monitoring systems are a scalable and cost‐effective form of remote patient monitoring. In this study, we showed that a mobile phone‐based remote monitoring system improved heart function, quality of life, and self‐care. To achieve these positive outcomes, reductions in healthcare resource utilization might not immediately occur, but savings could be realized in the long‐term.

AB: Introduction: Patients with pacemakers require regular follow‐ups after their implant. Currently in the UK, as well as most other countries, these patients routinely attend the hospital clinic for assessments, despite the availability of remote device interrogation technology for almost a decade. With increasing pressure from the volume of patients with pacemakers, changes in practice are required in order to provide a more efficient follow‐up service. Objectives: We conducted a study to assess the safety, feasibility and benefits of virtual at‐home follow‐up (V‐group) utilising Home Monitoring technology vs. standard in‐hospital follow‐up (S‐group) for routine pacemaker assessment. Methods: 43 patients undergoing dual chamber permanent pacemaker implant were randomised to the V‐group (21) and the S‐group (22), and followed‐up accordingly after the initial post‐implant 1‐month in‐hospital check. Further pacemaker follow‐ups were done at 6 months and 12 months in both groups. The primary end‐point was the total workload for patient pacemaker follow‐up care, which also included the total time for data analysis & clinical examinations during the 1‐, 6‐ and 12‐month follow‐ups. The secondary end‐point was the number of serious adverse events related to device implant and programming. Results: Over the 12‐month post‐implant interval, the median total work load per patient was 40.5mins (IQR: 21.5) and 60mins (IQR: 10) for the Vand S‐group, respectively, p<0.01. At the 12‐month follow‐up appointment, the median follow‐up duration per patient was 9mins (IQR: 5.5) and 25mins (IQR: 5), for the V‐ and S‐group, respectively, p<0.01. Three patients in the V‐group experienced device‐related adverse events (two lead displacements & one wound infection) which were not related to the Home Monitoring systems. Conclusion: Remote pacemaker follow‐up duration is significantly shorter when compared with standard in‐hospital follow‐up assessment. This reduces the hospital workload over the 12 months follow‐up period and, at the 12‐month stage, also provides a time & potential cost saving of sixty‐four per cent per patient follow‐up. A virtual at‐home pacemaker follow‐up clinic appears to be a safe & feasible alternative to the standard in‐hospital follow‐up clinic.

AB: Background: Large‐scale clinical trials are considered the gold standard primary research tool in assessing effectiveness of drug treatments. Typical trials, conducted within a complex regulatory framework, cost large amounts of money and take huge effort to carry out. Objectives: The Medicines Monitoring Unit (MEMO) of the University of Dundee specialises in large‐scale drug safety and effectiveness research using linkage to routinely collected data. This presentation will summarise the results of some of the methods attempted to improve this process and suggest potential areas for future development. Methods: Large clinical trials are complex studies conducted in a restrictive ethical and regulatory framework. Streamlined, or pragmatic, trials aim to produce externally valid evidence to meet clinically relevant needs in an efficient manner. In the conduct of several recent and current projects[1‐4], MEMO has experimented in various aspects of trial conduct from study design to recruitment and follow‐up, and clinical adjudication of database‐identified study endpoints. 1. Febuxostat versus Allopurinol Streamlined Trial (FAST): a large prospective, randomised, open, blinded endpoint study comparing the cardiovascular safety of allopurinol and febuxostat in the management of symptomatic hyperuricaemia. 2. Standard care vs. Celecoxib Outcome Trial (SCOT) ‐ a randomized trial of switching from prescribed non‐selective non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs to prescribed celecoxib. 3. ALL‐HEART ‐ a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open‐label, blinded end point trial of the efficacy of allopurinol therapy in improving cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischaemic heart disease. 4. Treatment In Morning versus Evening (TIME) study ‐ a large prospective, randomised, open‐label, blinded end‐point study comparing morning versus evening dosing in hypertensive patients. Results: MEMO projects have utilised a number of novel techniques including web‐based studies, diverse recruitment strategies, direct‐to‐participant drug supply, and email follow‐up with varying success. Conclusions: Effective trial methodologies are essential to the timely and efficient production of evidence to guide clinical decisions. Future MEMO projects aim to utilise cluster randomisation and further use of IT to facilitate remote study access. Trialists must explore novel methodologies if we are to be able to provide the evidence that learning healthcare systems require.

AB: Background: Ischaemia reperfusion (IR) injury at transplantation contributes to damage that limits allograft longevity, RIPC may protect against this injury. The REPAIR study demonstrated a trend towards improved iohexol GFR (adjusted mean difference 3.08 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.13), and a significant improvement in eGFR (4.98 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.011) at 1 year in patients undergoing early RIPC prior to LD kidney transplantation. We analysed eGFR and graft loss/mortality data up to 5 years. Methods: 406 adult live donor/recipient pairs were randomised by factorial design to: sham RIPC/early RIPC (immediately pre‐surgery)/late RIPC (24 h pre‐surgery)/dual RIPC (early+late RIPC). The primary outcome was iohexol GFR at 12 months. eGFR (CKD‐EPI) up to 60 months was an important secondary outcome, as was graft loss and all‐cause mortality. Results: eGFR data demonstrated a sustained benefit of early RIPC ‐ adjusted mean differences between control & early RIPC groups were 3.94 (p = 0.052), 5.16 (p = 0.015), 5.55 (p = 0.039) & 5.05 (p = 0.104) ml/min/ 1.73 m2 at 2,3,4 & 5 years (100% completed 3 years, 4 & 5 year follow up ongoing), Figure 1. There was no strong evidence for an effect of late RIPC on allograft function. There were no clinically significant/prolonged adverse effects. There was also a trend towards a reduction in all‐cause mortality and graft loss in the preconditioned groups. At the time of presentation we anticipate that the majority of patients will have completed 5 years of follow up, and this updated dataset can be presented. Conclusion: RIPC, a safe and virtually cost‐free intervention, resulted in sustained improvement in eGFR post LD transplantation, reaching 13% by 5 years. This is expected to translate into increased graft longevity, and with longer follow up, RIPC might also reduce mortality & graft loss. Given the resultant clinical, economic & quality of life implications, we recommend that RIPC is adopted into routine care for these patients.

AB: Background: Vascular risk factors are associated with an increased risk of dementia. Whether treatment of risk factors reduces the risk of cognitive decline and dementia is not known. The rise of eHealth has led to increasing opportunities for large‐scale delivery of prevention programs encouraging self‐management. The aim of HATICE is to investigate whether a multi‐domain intervention to optimise self‐management of cardiovascular risk factors in older individuals, delivered through a coach‐supported interactive internet platform, can improve the cardiovascular risk profile and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline. Methods: The HATICE‐project consists of three phases. 1) explore, pool and analyse data from the recently completed preDIVA, MAPT and FINGER trials to define the optimal multi‐domain interventions 2) develop an interactive internet‐intervention to improve cardiovascular risk management to prevent incident cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline and dementia, 3) Test this internetintervention in a multi‐national, multi‐centre, prospective, randomised, open‐label blinded endpoint trial with 18‐months intervention in 2600 persons >=65 years at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia. The intervention group will have access to an interactive internet platform, stimulating selfmanagement of vascular risk factors, with remote support by a coach. The control group will have access to a static internet platform with basic health information. Primary outcome is a composite score based on the average z‐score of systolic blood pressure, low‐density‐lipoprotein and body mass index. Main secondary outcomes include individual components of the primary outcome, incident cardiovascular disease, mortality, cognitive functioning, mood and cost‐effectiveness. Results: Recruitment started in March 2015 and over 2200 participants have been recruited so far. Recruitment is expected to be complete by July 2016. The first 12‐months assessments are ongoing and 18‐months follow‐up assessments will start in September 2015. Participants log in regularly and actively use the platform. Conclusions: A large multi‐national RCT using an internet intervention to improve the cardiovascular risk profile and prevent cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline is feasible. Preliminary baseline data and user statistics will be presented. Final trial results are expected in mid 2018.

AB: Introduction Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) is a common nosocomial infection that recurs in more than 1 in 4 cases. Garey et al. found that a course of rifaximin after standard therapy reduced relapse rate though not significantly1. We aimed to confirm or refute this finding. Method Design A parallel group, randomised, placebo controlled trial in 23 English hospitals. Funding NIHR RfPB Grant PB‐PG‐0110‐21041. Norgine supplied drug and placebo without charge. Population age 18 with resolution of CDAD after treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin. CDAD diagnosis required evidence of toxin production or pseudomembranes at endoscopy. Exclusion criteria: pregnancy or breast feeding; life expectancy <4 weeks; unable to take intervention (hypersensitivity or swallowing disorder);>5 days elapsed since treatment. Randomisation was stratified by hospital using a remote, internet‐ based system. Participants, clinicians and researchers were blind to allocation. Intervention Rifaximin 1200 mg daily for two weeks then 600 mg daily for two weeks, in three divided doses. Comparator: identical placebo. Primary Outcome: relapse ≤12 weeks after treatment initiation. Sample size The planned sample size was 180 to detect a difference in relapse of 20% (30% placebo, 10% rifaximin) with 80% power, allowing for loss to follow‐up of 20%. EudraCT 2012‐ 003205‐10; www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01670149 Results Recruitment occurred December 2012‐March 2015. Of 2157 patients screened, 151 were eligible, willing and randomised before funding limits were reached (74 placebo, 77 rifaximin). Primary outcome data were available on 130. Mean age was 71.9 (SD 15.3). 36% were in‐patients at start of intervention. 18/61 (29.5%) on placebo relapsed within 12 weeks compared to 11/69 (15.9%) on rifaximin, a difference between groups of ‐13.7% (95% CI ‐28.1% to 0.7%, p=0.06). The risk ratio was 0.54 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.05, p=0.07). During 6 month safety follow up 9 participants died in each group (12%). Adverse event rates were similar between groups. Conclusion CDAD relapse rate was 13.7% lower than on placebo. The confidence interval means that lack of effect remains possible but the estimated effect size is similar to Garey's trial, and those reported for fidaxomicin, with longer follow‐up2. Age and mortality rate were higher in our trial which may reflect greater similarity to the population at risk. Comparative trials of cost effectiveness should follow.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To identify variables that predict adherence with annual eye examinations using the Compliance with Annual Diabetic Eye Exams Survey (CADEES), a new questionnaire designed to measure health beliefs related to diabetic retinopathy and annual eye examinations. DESIGN: Questionnaire development. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred sixteen adults with diabetes. METHODS: We developed the CADEES based on a review of the literature, the framework of the Health Belief Model, expert opinion, and pilot study data. To examine content validity, we analyzed participant responses to an open‐ended question asking for reasons why people do not obtain annual eye examinations. We evaluated construct validity with principal components analysis and examined internal consistency with Cronbach's α. To assess predictive validity, we used multivariate logistic regression with self‐reported adherence as the dependent variable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Associations with self‐reported adherence (defined as having a dilated eye examination in the past year). RESULTS: The content analysis showed that CADEES items covered 89% of the reasons given by participants for not obtaining an annual eye examination. The principal components analysis identified 3 informative components that made up 32% of the variance. Multivariate logistic regression modeling revealed several significant predictors of adherence, including beliefs concerning whether insurance covered most of the eye examination cost (P < 0.01), whether there were general barriers that make it difficult to obtain an eye examination (P < 0.01), whether obtaining an eye examination was a top priority (P = 0.02), and whether diabetic eye disease can be seen with an examination (P = 0.05). Lower hemoglobin A1c levels (P < 0.01), having insurance (P = 0.01), and a longer duration of diabetes (P = 0.02) also were associated with adherence. A multivariate model containing CADEES items and demographic variables classified cases with 72% accuracy and explained approximately 24% of the variance in adherence. CONCLUSIONS: The CADEES showed good content and predictive validity. Although additional research is needed before finalizing a shorter version of the survey, our findings suggest that researchers and clinicians may be able to improve adherence by (1) counseling newly diagnosed patients, as well as those with uncontrolled blood glucose, on the importance of annual eye examinations and (2) discussing perceived barriers and misconceptions.

AB: In collaboration with a 15‐member Community Advisory Board that includes community care providers, healthcare organizations, and ADRD caregivers themselves, the proposed 5‐year project will build on the current efforts of The Lutheran Home Association (TLHA) to evaluate eNeighbor remote monitoring technology for persons with ADRD living in the community and their family caregivers. The Specific Aims are as follows: 1. To determine the efficacy of remote sensor technology over an 18‐month period for 100 persons with ADRD and their caregivers randomly assigned to an eNeighbor treatment condition when compared to 100 usual care controls. The investigators hypothesize: Hx. 1) Significant (p < .05) improvements in caregiver self‐efficacy and sense of competence in managing a relative's ADRD; Hx. 2) Significant reductions in caregiver distress (e.g., subjective stress, or feelings of emotional fatigue and role entrapment; depressive symptoms); Hx. 3) Significant delay of or reductions in health transitions (falls, wandering) and service utilization (hospitalizations, nursing home admission) for persons with ADRD; and Hx. 4) Greater cost‐effectiveness associated with a person with ADRD's health service use. 2. To "embed" evaluation components: a) during the randomized controlled evaluation through the administration of open‐ended survey items to all ADRD caregivers in the eNeighbor treatment condition every 6 months to examine the utility of the remote health monitoring technology; and b) at the conclusion of the 18‐month evaluation by purposively sampling 15 ADRD caregivers who reported positive acceptance on the embedded qualitative and quantitative 6‐, 12‐, and 18‐month system reviews and 15 ADRD caregivers who reported low acceptance on the embedded qualitative and quantitative 6‐, 12‐, and 18‐month system reviews to participate in semi‐structured interviews. The interviews will help the research team determine why the health monitoring intervention was or was not efficacious; and 3. To engage stakeholders on a quarterly basis throughout the 5‐year project with the goal of enhancing the utility (via community‐based participatory approaches) and stakeholder‐relevance of eNeighbor implementation and evaluation for family caregivers of persons with ADRD.

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct00664924
YR: 2008
KY: Critical Illness
AB: The Remote Physiological Monitoring System (RPM™) is a wireless technology for physiological monitoring. The RPM™ is designed to capture, transmit and remotely monitor the vital signs of a patient or group of patients. The RPM™ allows the patient to carry an unobtrusive unit and sensor array, which is able to store and/or forward its data via existing communication networks. This data is archivable and can be made available to a monitoring station or stations. This approach obviates the need to provide new and expensive infrastructure to support the system since it is designed to 'piggy‐back' on the existing network. A major clinical advantage of the RPM™ and the principal reason why it may offer a benefit to patients, is that it provides continuous remote monitoring of vital signs, in contrast to the current situation for ward patients, where there is intermittent vital signs monitoring. This is a major advantage for patients and hospital staff, since there is increasing evidence that demonstrate early recognition and treatment of clinical events, e.g., shock, can save lives; the concurrent cost and labour saving is a further obvious benefit. The RPM™ uses wireless technology to overcome the portability problems associated with conventional patient monitoring systems. The RPM™ consists of the following system components: 1. Physiological Monitoring Unit (PMU) 2. Data Aggregation Server (DAS) 3. Clinical Monitoring Position (CMP) To validate the RPM™ device for regulatory approval, BRYTECH will evaluate the RPM™ in a clinical setting, thereby ensuring that the system is trustworthy and acceptable to health professionals as a monitoring system in patients. The study proposes to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the RPM™ compared to monitors commonly used in the medical practice under the standard conditions of medical practice The study also proposes to evaluate notification and alarm systems, the communications interface and non‐interference with existing systems, devices, networks and procedures as well as the incremental nursing workload associated with the integration of the RPM™ in a clinical environment. The RPM™ and reference physiological monitoring devices will be compared for physiological monitoring capabilities in 40 patients.

AB: BACKGROUND: Among patients who have had a heart attack, nearly half stop taking their statin medications within a year. Simple nudges such as individual adherence feedback or social incentives (peer pressure) might facilitate adherence. METHODS: We conducted a 6‐month randomized controlled trial testing two different feedback approaches to improve medication adherence among veterans with CAD who had been prescribed a statin but were poorly adherent (defined as a medication possession ratio of <80 %). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1. a control group that received an electronic pill monitoring device with no alarms or feedback; 2. an individual feedback group that received a daily alarm and a weekly medication adherence feedback report; and 3. a partner feedback group that received an alarm and a weekly feedback report that was shared with the participant and a selected partner (a friend, family member, or a similar peer struggling with statin adherence). The intervention continued for 3 months; participants were followed for an additional 3 months post‐intervention. The primary outcome was adherence during the 3 months of the intervention. Secondary outcomes included change in LDL mg/dl, patient activation, and social support. RESULTS: We enrolled 126 patients. We used a stratified 2:2:3 block assignment to assign extra participants into the partner feedback arm since participants were being offered a choice of a family member or a peer (Control: 36, Individual Feedback: 36, Partner Feedback: 54). Demographic characteristics were similar across control and treatment groups. During the 3 month intervention period, medication adherence in both feedback arms was higher than in the control arm (89 % in the individual feedback; 86 % in the partner feedback; 67%in the control group ‐ p‐value for comparison with control = 0.0011 and 0.0004, respectively). There was no significant difference in adherence between the 2 feedback groups. In the post‐intervention period, when all feedback mechanisms were stopped, adherence rates dropped in both feedback groups. At 6 months there was no differences in medication adherence between the feedback groups and control (60 % in individual feedback group; 52 % in partner feedback group; 54 % in the control group‐p‐value for comparison with control = 0.75 and 0.97, respectively). There were no changes relative to control in any of the other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Daily alarms combined with individual feedback reports or individual and partner feedback improved statin medication adherence in veterans with CAD and poor adherence. While neither individual feedback nor a partner feedback strategy created a sustainable medication adherence habit, the intervention itself is relatively easy to implement and low cost. If improved adherence continues if the intervention remains active, remote monitoring with adherence feedback could be a relatively simple way to improve long‐term medication adherence.

KY: Trichotillomania
AB: Despite ongoing research into causes and treatments for trichotillomania, it remains poorly understood, underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. Further, treatment of TTM in children has received little attention, and only recently have the investigators begun to see research in pediatric trich. One possible way of progressing treatment development for pediatric trich is to clarify the nature of inhibitory control processes implicated in TTM and to develop a treatment that specifically targets these implicated cognitive processes. Examples of this strategy are found in the increasing availability of translational research that has demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of computerized cognitive training programs (CTPs) in modifying problematic cognitive processes in numerous psychiatric conditions. The objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of CTP for enhancing response inhibition capabilities among individuals with trich, thereby reducing TTM symptoms. To this end, young individuals aged between 12 and 18 with TTM will be randomly assigned to the CTP condition vs. a wait‐list condition. Participants in the CTP condition will receive eight 30‐min training sessions over a 4‐week period and will be assessed at three time points. Participants in the wait‐list will be evaluated at baseline and post‐training assessments, and will be allowed to receive the CTP after completing the post‐training assessment. Wait‐list controls who choose to cross over to the CTP condition will also provide a small replication sample to test the effect of our response inhibition training. There are three primary implications from this work. First, demonstrating successful enhancement in response inhibition by our proposed CTP is expected to create ample opportunities for clinical research not only on TTM, but also for numerous other psychiatric problems in which poor response inhibition is implicated (e.g., Chronic Skin Picking, Tourette Syndrome, OCD, and ADHD). This research has the potential to produce a highly cost‐efficient self‐administered intervention for TTM. Upon establishing efficacy, CTPs may be easily integrated into various contexts, examples include CTPs as an adjunctive intervention to existing behavioral and/or pharmacological treatments, an instrument to identify and help at‐risk individuals for preventative training, a stand‐alone short‐term intervention, and a remote web‐based self‐help intervention for individuals who have no easy access to treatment resources or are reluctant to seek treatment.

YR: 2018
AB: Hypothesis: HIV‐Self‐Test (HIV‐ST) will allow peers or peer‐networks to effectively and efficiently link older adolescent girls and young women into HIV prevention and care services. Design: A cluster randomized control trial comparing two models of peer delivery of HIV‐ST, through incentivized respondent driven peer networks and direct distribution by peer navigators compared to standard of care (referral to HIV testing, prevention and care services by peer navigators) in improving the uptake of HIV prevention and care amongst young women (18‐24) living in the rural uMkhanyakude district of KwaZulu‐Natal, South Africa. Objectives: 1. To increase the knowledge of HIV status among young women aged 18‐24 years old through distribution of HIV‐ST through incentivized peer networks or direct distribution by peer navigators compared to peer navigators referring into HIV testing services. 2. To determine an increase in the rate of linkage among young women aged 18‐24 to HIV prevention and treatment services facilitated by distribution of HIV‐ST through incentivized peer networks or direct distribution by peer navigators compared to peer navigators referring into services. 3. To conduct a process evaluation of the acceptability, feasibility, and reach (out of school, recently migrant and living in remote areas) in linking 18‐24‐year‐old women to HIV prevention and treatment services of HIV‐ST distribution through incentivized peer networks, or direct distribution by peer navigators or peer navigators referring into services. 4. To measure the cost per 18‐24‐year‐old linked to prevention and care through peer‐led incentivized HIV‐ST delivery system or direct distribution of HIV‐SS by peer navigators, compared to peer navigator referring into services. Primary Outcomes: The difference between the rate of linkage within three months of 18‐24 years old women to HIV confirmatory testing and pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) eligibility screening if HIV‐negative and antiretroviral treatment (ART) starting if HIV‐positive. It will be between the two peer‐delivery approaches to HIV‐ST distribution (incentivized HIV‐ST delivery through peer network and direct distribution of HIV‐ST by peer navigators) compared to standard of care (peer navigator referral to HIV testing, treatment and prevention services). Rate is defined as the number of linkages per month of peer navigator outreach activity.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a non‐invasive and virtually cost‐free strategy for protecting the heart against acute ischaemia‐reperfusion injury (IRI). We have recently shown that the inhibition of extracellular RNA (eRNA) using non‐toxic RNase1 protected the heart against acute IRI, reduced myocardial infarct (MI) size and preserved left ventricular systolic function in rodent animal MI models. Based on this previous work in animals, the role of the eRNA/RNase1 system in cardiac RIPC in humans should be defined. METHODS: Fourteen patients underwent cardiac surgery without RIPC; from each patient, six separate 5 ml blood specimens from radial artery and two blood specimens from coronary sinus at different time points during heart surgery were taken. Six healthy donors received RIPC (4 × 5 min upper limb ischaemia); blood parameters were quantified before and after RIPC. Twelve patients underwent cardiac surgery of which 6 received RIPC, whereas the remaining 6 were exposed to sham procedure. Circulating eRNA was quantified in plasma from arterial and coronary sinus blood obtained from patients undergoing cardiac by standard procedures. Tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) production by heart tissue was assessed by enzyme‐linked immuno‐sorbent assay; RNase activity was quantified by an enzymatic assay. RESULTS: Before surgery, eRNA levels were similar in both groups (14 ± 6 vs 13 ± 5 ng/ml; P = 0.9967). In patients without RIPC, arterial eRNA levels rose during surgery (87 ± 12 ng/ml) and peaked after (127 ± 11 ng/ml) aortic declamping; accordingly, eRNA levels in coronary sinus blood were significantly higher (206 ± 32 ng/ml; P = 0.0129) than that in radial artery. Moreover, significant elevation of TNF‐α (36 ± 6 ng/ml; P = 0.0059) particularly in coronary sinus blood after opening of the aortic clamping was observed. Interestingly, applying a RIPC protocol significantly increased levels of plasma endogenous vascular RNase1 by >7‐fold, and the levels of arterial (31 ± 7 ng/ml; P = 0.0024) and coronary sinus (37 ± 9 ng/ml; P < 0.0001) circulating eRNA, as well as circulating TNF‐α (20 ± 4 ng/ml; P = 0.0050) levels were significantly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Upon RIPC, the level of cardioprotective RNase1 increased, while the concentration of damaging eRNA and TNF‐α decreased. The present findings imply a significant contribution of the RIPC‐dependent (endothelial) RNase1 for improving the outcome of cardiac surgery. However, the exact mechanism of RNase1‐induced cardioprotection still remains to be explored.

AB: Background and aims: An increasing body of evidence shows that cognitive stimulation programs benefit cognition in people with mild to moderate dementia over and above any medication effects (Woods et al., 2012). Little is known however as to potential benefits and clinical significance regarding long term continuum of care programs in PWD. Information and Communication Technologies have been increasingly provided as a support for PWD and their careers, although lack of familiarity of elder people with technologies is often considered as a criticism. Within the framework of the Ability project (Ability ‐ Telerehabilitation, Smart Cities and Communities regional funding program, Miur‐Por 2007‐2013), we tested the usability of the technology‐ enhanced Ability platform and the adherence to a home‐based motor‐cognitive rehabilitation program delivered with two different approaches: the Ability platform versus usual care. Methods: 20 MCI and 10 PWA were randomized in the Ability program and in the usual care program groups. The Ability program is an at home technology enhanced platform a) delivering tablet‐based intensive (five days/a week) motor and cognitive activities; b) monitoring from remote vital and physical health parameters (i.e., weight, Heart Rate, O2 saturation, daily steps, sleep activity). We evaluated the platform usability in the Ability group through the computation of phone contacts between the Support Service Centre and Ability participants. Moreover we administered the System Usability Scale (SUS; Borsci et al., 2009) to both MCI/PWA and respective caregivers after the intervention. We tested adherence to treatment through statistical comparison of the number of daily sessions completed between the two groups. Results: The Ability group showed a better adherence to treatment in comparison to the usual care group by performing a significantly higher number of corrected sessions (number of sessions per day/ subject; p <.007) and a significantly higher “Pause index” (number of correct pause periods/subject; p <.001). As expected, the Ability platform was rated differently in usability (caregiver > MCI/PWA; p<.05) and learnability (caregiver < MCI/PWA; p<.005). Discussion and conclusions: The Ability program provides a usable and accessible way to empower participants in their own care. As a positive technology (PT) able to create a smart health community, it also promotes interpersonal connectedness and engages dyads in effective treatment adherence. Moreover, it has the potential to provide a cost effective long term intervention for MCI and PWA within continuum of care programs.

AB: Objective: To describe the deployment of a wireless remote inertial sensing system to monitor and influence the amount of walking practice during inpatient rehabilitation after stroke. Background: The amount of active therapy provided to patients during inpatient stroke rehabilitation is estimated to be rather modest. Efforts to objectively and continuously quantify gait training after hemiplegic stroke have been hampered by the cost or insensitivity of commercially available devices to record the slow speeds and asymmetric movements typically seen after stroke. Using a system of wearable inertial sensors and machine‐learning algorithms, the SIRRACT trial (Stroke Inpatient Rehabilitation Reinforcement of ACTivity, NCT01246882) aimed to increase the time patients spent walking during inpatient rehabilitation by providing personalized feedback. Methods: Trial participants were recruited from 12 international (Egypt, India, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, and Turkey) and 4 American rehabilitation centers. Inclusion criteria were stroke within the past month requiring inpatient rehabilitation, residual hemiparesis, and the ability to walk at least 5 steps on study entry. During the trial, all individuals participated in standard rehabilitative therapies while wearing triaxial accelerometers at both ankles to record purposeful activities, including walking. Sensor data were uploaded nightly to a central server at UCLA for processing. The wireless system used Bayesian machine‐learning algorithms and individual gait templates to identify bouts of walking from within daily activity recordings. Parameters were calculated for each walking bout (speed, duration) and each day's activity (number of bouts, average walking speed, total time spent walking, total distance, total steps). Half the participants were randomly assigned to receive sensor‐ derived feedback about walking performance 3 days a week and the other half to feedback about walking speed only. Results: In all, 151 participants underwent randomization. Patients with a range of disabilities and initial walking speeds, some as low as 0.2 m/s, were included. More than 2000 days of therapy were recorded by study completion. Sensors were actively recording data for more than 8 hours a day. The system identified 37 000 discrete walking episodes containing more than 2.5 million steps. Therapy‐related activities, including cycling, leg extensions, and knee extensions were also automatically identified by the system. Results of the effects of higher levels of feedback will be presented. Conclusions: This trial demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of using inexpensive wireless health technology to remotely monitor the activity of disabled persons in the acute rehabilitation setting. Problem solving challenges for expanding activity monitoring into the outpatient and home care settings will be discussed.

AB: Background Diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) are at higher risk of peri‐operative myocardial injury (PMI) with subsequent worse short and long‐term clinical outcomes. Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC), in which the application of one or more brief cycles of non‐lethal ischaemia and reperfusion to an organ or tissue protects the heart against a lethal episode of acute ischaemia‐reperfusion injury, has emerged as a non‐invasive, low‐cost therapeutic intervention for protecting the heart in patients undergoing CABG surgery. However, both experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that the diabetic heart presents an increased resistance to the protective effects of RIPC. Whether by increasing the preconditioning stimulus we can protect diabetic patients undergoing CABG surgery is unknown. Methods and results 87 consecutive diabetic patients undergoing elective CABG surgery were recruited into two substudies. In the first substudy (N=53), patients were randomised to receive either standard RIPC protocol (3‐5 min cycles of upper arm cuff inflation to 200 mm Hg with intervening 5 min deflation, N=26) or control (uninflated cuff placed on the upper arm for 30 min, N=27) following anaesthesia induction. In the second substudy (N=34), patients were randomised to receive either an enhanced RIPC stimulus (2‐ 5 min cycles of simultaneous upper arm and thigh cuff inflation to 200 mm Hg with intervening 5 min deflation, N=17) or control (uninflated cuffs placed on the upper arm and thigh for 20 min, N=17). PMI was calculated as area‐under‐the‐curve (AUC) of troponin‐T (TnT), measured pre‐operatively and 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 h post‐surgery. In the first substudy with standard preconditioning protocol, there was no difference in the 72 h TnT AUC between control and RIPC (AUC was respectively 22.17 mg/l and 22.22 mg/l, p=0.98). However, in the second substudy and with the application of the enhanced preconditioning stimulus, we observed a significant reduction in the 72 h TnT AUC in the RIPC group compared to control (31.73 mug/l vs 19.63 mug/l respectively, p=0.022). Conclusions An enhanced preconditioning stimulus by multi‐limb RIPC reduces PMI in diabetic patients undergoing CABG surgery. Larger multicentre studies are being conducted to confirmthese studies.

AB: IMPORTANCE: Consistent professional interpretation improves communication with patients who have limited English proficiency. Remote modalities (telephone and video) have the potential for wide dissemination. OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of telephone vs. video interpretation on communication during pediatric emergency care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized trial of telephone vs. video interpretation at a free‐standing, university‐affiliated pediatric emergency department (ED). A convenience sample of 290 Spanish‐speaking parents of pediatric ED patients with limited English proficiency were approached from February 24 through August 16, 2014, of whom 249 (85.9%) enrolled; of these, 208 (83.5%) completed the follow‐up survey (91 parents in the telephone arm and 117 in the video arm). Groups did not differ significantly by consent or survey completion rate, ED factors (eg, ED crowding), child factors (eg, triage level, medical complexity), or parent factors (eg, birth country, income). Investigators were blinded to the interpretation modality during outcome ascertainment. Intention‐to‐treat data were analyzed August 25 to October 20, 2014. INTERVENTIONS: Telephone or video interpretation for the ED visit, randomized by day. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Parents were surveyed 1 to 7 days after the ED visit to assess communication and interpretation quality, frequency of lapses in interpreter use, and ability to name the child's diagnosis. Two blinded reviewers compared parent‐reported and medical record‐abstracted diagnoses and classified parent‐reported diagnoses as correct, incorrect, or vague. RESULTS: Among 208 parents who completed the survey, those in the video arm were more likely to name the child's diagnosis correctly than those in the telephone arm (85 of 114 [74.6%] vs. 52 of 87 [59.8%]; P = .03) and less likely to report frequent lapses in interpreter use (2 of 117 [1.7%] vs. 7 of 91 [7.7%]; P = .04). No differences were found between the video and telephone arms in parent‐reported quality of communication (101 of 116 [87.1%] vs. 74 of 89 [83.1%]; P = .43) or interpretation (58 of 116 [50.0%] vs. 42 of 89 [47.2%]; P = .69). Video interpretation was more costly (per‐patient mean [SD] cost, $61 [$36] vs. $31 [$20]; P < .001). Parent‐reported adherence to the assigned modality was higher for the video arm (106 of 114 [93.0%] vs .68 of 86 [79.1%]; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Families with limited English proficiency who received video interpretation were more likely to correctly name the child's diagnosis and had fewer lapses in interpreter use. Use of video interpretation shows promise for improving communication and patient care in this population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01986179.

AB: Background: In recent years, various studies have firmly established simulation training to be superior to traditional training methods, however it is yet to be fully incorporated into the surgical residency training in outside of North America. In Japan, distribution residents in wider variety of hospital, lack of finance and time for training has limited incorporation of simulation into residency training. There is a need for cost effective systematic training system for novice surgeons. We had previously developed and validated the TAPP checklist, to evaluate the recorded performance of transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair and developed an educational system which included the didactic materials based on the TAPP checklist and incorporated remote evaluation and feedback system. Objective: To evaluate the educational impact of the TAPP education system on novice surgeons. Method: Residents and surgeons from participating hospitals, who had performed 0 or 1 TAPP procedure were recruited for this study from April 2015 to March 2016. The participants were randomly assigned to Intervention Group (IG) who trained using this new educational tool and Control Group (CG) who trained using the conventional system. They were required to send the surgical videos of their TAPP cases. These videos were rated by blinded raters. All the participants performed their first case before randomization as control. The participants scoring more than 20 (full marks 24) in their first case were excluded from the study. IG then received the Educational tools and ratings and feedback from their surgery. They were also encouraged to practice intracorporeal suturing in the drybox. They were allowed to perform further cases after they met the predetermined operator criteria. The improvement of the TAPP checklist scores of both groups were compared from case 1 to 3. We also compared their scores of their 3rd case. Result: The eighteen participants from 9 institutes were recruited for this study. 7 participants in IG and 5 participants in CG completed the study and were included in the final analysis. There was no difference between the backgrounds of the participants. From their first case, the participants in IG and CG had improved their scores by 8.7 (SD5.0) and 1.0 (SD3.2) respectively (p=0.01). The IG score of 3rd case by 21.3 (SD2.0) was significantly higher than that of CG score by 16.4 (SD 4.7) (p=0.04). Conclusion: The newly developed TAPP educational system was effective in improving the TAPP performance of novice surgeons.

YR: 2015
AB: INTERVENTION: Participants are given access to the self‐management programme. Participants are supported through the programme for 3 months, but have access for a year. The tablet computers are preloaded with the web‐based version of the SPACE for COPD programme and are offered face‐to‐face video conferencing with clinicians/nurses. Normal care is not disrupted including referral and attendance to pulmonary rehabilitation. The study assesses whether this intervention increases patient uptake of pulmonary rehabilitation services offered. CONDITION: Respiratory COPD exercabations ; Respiratory ; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease PRIMARY OUTCOME: The reason for this project is to understand the feasibility and acceptability of the novel tablet based self management support at the time of a hospital discharge. The primary consideration for the study will be uptake and acceptability. Uptake will be reported and web usage will be closely monitored through a sophisticated web monitoring component embedded in the existing site. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Current secondary outcome measures as of 21/03/2016:; 1. Readmission rates, measured using hospital record checks; 2. Health‐related quality of life, measured using CAT and CRQ questionnaire; 3. Anxiety and depression, measured using HADS questionnaire; 4. Physical activity, measured using PACER questionnaire; 5. Impact on clinical team (staff time/cost); 6. Patient and clinician thoughts about the study and intervention, assessed using qualitative interviews; Collected at 3 and 6 months.; ; Previous secondary outcome measures:; 1. Health‐related quality of life; 2. Anxiety and depression; 3. Hospital readmissions; These will be collected at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of exacerbation COPD. This may include patients with existing disease or patients who are newly diagnosed on admission to hospital. All patients who are admitted into the Glenfield Hospital with an exacerbation of or newly diagnosed COPD will be screened for eligibility i.e. willing to take part in this pilot study. Individuals do not necessarily have WiFi access and so a 3G connection is provided as part of the package. Eligible patients will however need to have a current email account and be computer literate. Willing participants will be given full instructions on how to access the SPACE self‐management programme website via their chosen device.

AB: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The development of tablet computers and user‐friendly videoconferencing applications has made telemedicine a practical tool for physicians to potentially meet the growing demands of modern healthcare. Our study aimed to compare post‐operative outcomes and patient satisfaction scores among patients who are seen in person (Standard Care, SC) versus those seen via videoconferencing (VC) by their surgeon in the hospital. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective urologic surgery requiring inpatient admission were randomized to SC or VC during their hospital stay. All patients were physically examined by urology residents under the supervision of the attending surgeon at the bedside (SC) or by iPad (VC). The attending was prompted to evaluate the patient in person by any significant change in clinical status. The primary outcome was 30‐ day complication rate. Secondary outcomes included severity of complications, 30‐day readmission rate, patient satisfaction, length of stay, number of laboratory and imaging tests obtained, and number of encounters by the attending surgeon. Two‐sample t‐test was used to compare continuous variables, and chi‐squared or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. RESULTS: Of the 106 patients recruited, 102 patients were included for analysise with 49 patients randomized to SC and 53 patients to VC. Four patients were excluded due to intraoperative findings which precluded an inpatient admission. Age, gender and racial distribution, body‐mass index, Charlson‐Age Comorbidity Index, American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, type of surgery, and estimated blood loss were similar between groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall complication rate (26.5% v 17%, p=0.24) or readmission rate (10.2% v 5.7%, p=0.39). Interestingly, the average number of laboratory tests ordered were higher in the SC group (7.2 vs 4.4, p = 0.038). Other secondary outcomes were similar between groups (see Table). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that VC rounds is a safe alternative to bedside hospital rounds in the routine care of urologic postoperative patients. Furthermore, there was no difference in patient satisfaction scores between the two groups. Telerounding is a cost effective and efficient means to manage postoperative urological inpatients.

AB: OBJECTIVE: The present study (Shyness 7) has two aims: Firstly, to replicate an earlier trial showing that a self‐guided Internet treatment for social phobia is efficacious, and secondly, to examine whether the addition of self‐guided motivational enhancement strategies improves completion rates and clinical outcomes. METHOD: Randomized controlled trial (RCT) of self‐guided Internet‐based cognitive behavioural treatment (iCBT), or iCBT plus self‐guided motivational enhancement strategies (iCBT+MS), was conducted. An intention‐to‐treat and last observation carried forward model was used for data analyses. The participants consisted of 108 volunteers with social phobia. The iCBT intervention consisted of two online lessons about symptoms and treatment of anxiety disorders and six lessons about management of social phobia (the Shyness programme) with complex automated reminders. The motivational intervention was based on traditional techniques including understanding and exploring ambivalence about change using a cost–benefit analysis, developing and resolving discrepancy between values and symptoms, and enhancing self‐efficacy for change. The main outcome measures were the Social Interaction Anxiety Scale and Social Phobia Scale. RESULTS: More iCBT+MS group participants completed the eight lessons than iCBT group participants (75% versus 56%, respectively), but there were no between‐group differences in outcome measures at post‐treatment or at 3 month follow up. Large mean within‐groups effect sizes (Cohen's d) for the two social phobia measures were found for both the iCBT and iCBT+ MS groups (1.1 and 0.95, respectively), which were sustained at 3 month follow up (1.06 and 1.07, respectively). Both iCBT and iCBT+MS group participants reported that the procedures were highly acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Both self‐guided versions of the Shyness programme were reliably efficacious, confirming that people with social phobia may significantly benefit from a highly structured self‐guided intervention. The addition of motivational techniques increased completion rates but did not improve clinical outcomes or acceptability.

AB: Objectives: The Philadelphia Telemedicine Glaucoma Detection and Follow‐up Study is a CDC‐funded prospective randomized controlled trial comparing a social worker intervention (enhanced intervention, EI) to address individual and systemic barriers to ophthalmology care versus usual care (UC). The study investigates the effect of EI on adherence to recommended follow‐up eyecare in underserved Philadelphia communities. Study objectives include determining incremental cost‐effectiveness of EI versus UC using health utilities derived from the 25‐item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI‐VFQ‐25). Objective of this analysis was to assess differences in baseline utility by demographics. Methods: Baseline demographics and NEI‐VFQ‐25 responses were collected for subjects randomized into the study. Demographics were assessed using descriptive statistics, and baseline utility scores (VFQ‐UI) were derived from NEI‐VFQ‐25 responses using a validated algorithm. T‐tests and ANOVA were used to assess statistical significance of differences between mean VFQ‐UI by gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, and diabetic history. Results: The sample comprised 340 subjects, n= 171 randomized to EI and n= 169 randomized UC. Mean age of the entire sample was 60.65 years (SD ±11.03), 59.1% were female, 65.0% were African American, and 55.9% reported history of diabetes. Mean sample VFQ‐UI was 0.864 (SD ±0.111); mean EI VFQ‐UI was 0.866 (SD: ±0.112) versus 0.862 (SD ±0.111) for UC. VFQ‐UI was not statistically different by study group (p= 0.790). No statistical differences were identified in the mean reported VFQ‐UI by gender (p= 0.215) or diabetes status (p= 0.604). Race, ethnicity, and marital status significantly impacted VFQ‐UI (p= < 0.001, 0.005, 0.009, respectively). Conclusions: Mean VFQ‐UI is generally high at baseline and did not statistically differ by study group; however, statistically significant differences were seen by race, ethnicity, and marital status, suggesting that changes in utility during the clinical trial should be measured for relevant subgroups. Future work entails evaluating change in VFQ‐UI at 18 and 36 months.

AB: Background: To compare text messaging and face‐to‐face interviews to conduct a survey on childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia. Methods: Caregivers of young children able to send text messages in Zhao County in rural China were included in this crossover study. Villages (clusters) were randomized into two groups using the ratio 1:1.6 to account for an expected higher drop‐out in group 2. In group 1, participants first completed the face‐to‐face and then text messaging survey; this order was reversed in group 2. We determined data equivalence of 17 questions that were answered by participants who were the same person in both surveys. For the text messaging survey, we assessed the overall and item response rate. Results: We included 1014 participants between 16 and 28 March 2013: 371 in 15 villages in group 1 and 643 in 27 villages in group 2. A total of 662 (65.3%) out of 1014 participants responded (first text message question) and a significantly higher proportion who did not respond were from rural areas (P = 0.005). Of 651 participants willing to participate, 356 (54.7%) completed the text messaging survey, which was marginally significantly different between the groups (P = 0.05). In total, 409 participants took part in both surveys: 183 in group 1 and 226 in group 2. There was a significantly higher proportion of caregivers from rural areas in Zhao County in the non‐responder group compared to the responder group (P = 0.004). Kappas were substantial for six (0.61‐0.80), moderate for two (0.58 and 0.60), and fair for three questions (0.31, 0.35 and 0.37). The proportion of agreement was >90% for five questions; 80.0%‐90.0% for five questions; 70.0%, 65.0% and 45.5%. The remaining questions had too small numbers to calculate these values. Conclusions: This study shows that text messaging data collection produces data similar to data from face‐to‐face interviews in a middle‐income setting, but the response rate was insufficient for use in public health surveys. Improving the response rate is important, because text message surveys could be of greater value in rural remote areas due to the cost‐saving potential.

AB: OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this pragmatic randomized controlled trial were to investigate the impact of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and an active social control (befriending) on depression and anxiety symptoms in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: Eligible participants were randomly allocated to receive eight weekly telephone interventions of CBT (n = 54) or befriending (n = 56). Repeated‐measures ANOVA was used to assess changes in scores and Cohen's d was used to assess effect sizes. RESULTS: Significant improvement was observed in anxiety symptoms for the befriending group from baseline (T1) to post‐intervention assessment (T2) and to 8‐week follow‐up assessment (T3), with a small to medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.3). Significant improvement was noted in depression symptoms from T1 to T2 for both groups, but only the CBT group had a significant difference at T3, with a small to medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.4). For secondary outcomes, there was a significant change in COPD symptoms from T1 to T2 for the befriending group; however, at T3 this change was no longer significant. Finally, there was a significant change in general self‐efficacy for both groups between T1 and T2, and T1 and T3. CONCLUSION: Cognitive behaviour therapy reduced depression symptoms but not anxiety. Befriending reduced depression symptoms in the short term and anxiety symptoms in both the short term and long term. Further research is needed to demonstrate non‐inferiority of telephone delivery compared with other formats, and to understand the impact of befriending which has the potential to be a cost‐effective support for people with COPD. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Depression and anxiety are common comorbidities in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mood disorders are not commonly routinely treated in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Telephone‐administered CBT has been shown to be as effective as face‐to‐face CBT in reducing depression and anxiety. What does this study add? Telephone‐administered CBT can reduce depression symptoms in people with COPD. Telephone‐administered befriending can reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in people with COPD. People with COPD who have mood disorders would prefer to have CBT than befriending. Copyright © 2017 The British Psychological Society.

AB: Background The popularity of E‐health is rising and research has shown that E‐health interventions can be effective [1]. However, they also offer new challenges and questions in clinical practice and research, for example about the role of the patient‐therapist relationship [2,3]. In face‐to‐face treatments, a better patient‐therapist relationship has often been reported as a predictor for improved treatment outcome. Objectives In an E‐health cognitive‐behavioral treatment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, the patient‐therapist relationship was assessed and related to patient‐reported outcomes. Methods After a face‐to‐face intake, all patient‐therapist contact was through e‐mail. Patients rated the patient‐therapist relationship pre and post treatment using the Working Alliance Inventory and internet‐specific relationship questions. After treatment, patients were asked to rate improvement in symptoms and coping with these symptoms. Paired samples t‐tests (patient‐therapist relationship change during treatment) and regression analyses (association patient‐therapist relationship and patient‐reported outcome) were performed in a subsample of patients who had finished treatment. Results The patient‐therapist relationship was rated positively and increased during treatment (p <.05) as generally found in face to face treatments. Both a better patient‐therapist relationship and the specific internet related aspects (e.g., having time to think about the reply to the therapist) predicted patient‐reported improvement in coping with disease problems, such as pain and fatigue (p‐values <.05). At the end of treatment both relationship aspects are related to improvements in symptoms and coping with these symptoms (all p‐values <.05). Conclusions These preliminary results indicate that the patient‐therapist relationship is a possible predictor for self‐reported improvements in E‐health treatments, similar to the role of this patient‐therapist relationship in face‐to‐face treatments. Future results need to demonstrate whether the patient‐therapist relationship also contributes to the cost‐effectiveness of this E‐health treatment in the randomized controlled trial.

AB: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Although supportive cancer care can be effective, referral rates are low and many survivors have unmet needs. As a means of facilitating supportive care, we developed an eHealth application: OncoKompas. Cancer survivors can monitor their QOL by patient‐reported outcomes (PROs), followed by automatically generated tailored feedback and personalized referral to supportive care. The purpose of this feasibility study was to investigate the adoption of (intention to use), implementation of (actual use), and satisfaction with OncoKompas. We also investigated which sociodemographic and clinical factors are associated with feasibility as well as barriers and facilitators related. METHODS: A pretest‐posttest design was used, conducting a survey before providing access to OncoKompas, and 2 weeks after, followed by an interview by a nurse. Adoption was defined as the percentage of survivors that agreed to use and implementation as the percentage of survivors that actually used OncoKompas. Satisfaction was assessed based on 3 questions: general impression of OncoKompas, the user‐friendliness, being able to use OncoKompas without assistance (10‐point Likert scale) as well as on the Net Promoter Scale (NPS). RESULTS: OncoKompas was feasible with an adoption grade of 64%, an implementation grade between 70% and 91%, a mean satisfaction score of 7.25, and a positive NPS (1.92). Sociodemographic and clinical factors and HRQOL were not associated with satisfaction. Several facilitators and barriers related to feasibility were identified. CONCLUSIONS: In order to enhance feasibility and increase satisfaction, we have to balance the time it takes to use OncoKompas, measurement precision, and tailoring towards personalized advices. Research Implications: By gaining insight into feasibility issues we assessed the potential for successful implementation of OncoKompas and supported the development of a randomized controlled trial to examine the (cost‐) effectiveness of OncoKompas. Practice Implications: Our results show that the eHealth application OncoKompas could be a valuable addition to supportive cancer care. Study results implicate that OncoKompas has the potential to enhance supportive cancer care by supporting patients in providing and obtaining optimal supportive care.

AB: BACKGROUND: Personally controlled health management systems (PCHMS), which may include a personal health record (PHR), health management tools, and information resources, have been advocated as a next‐generation technology to improve health behaviors and outcomes. There have been successful trials of PCHMS in various health settings. However, there is mixed evidence for whether consumers will use these systems over the long term and whether they ultimately lead to improved health outcomes and behaviors. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test whether use of a PCHMS by consumers can increase the uptake or updating of a written asthma action plan (AAP) among adults with asthma. METHODS: A 12‐month parallel 2‐group randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants living with asthma were recruited nationally in Australia between April and August 2013, and randomized 1:1 to either the PCHMS group or control group (online static educational content). The primary outcome measure was possession of an up‐to‐date written AAP poststudy. Secondary measures included (1) utilizing the AAP; (2) planned or unplanned visits to a health care professional for asthma‐related concerns; (3) severe asthma exacerbation, inadequately controlled asthma, or worsening of asthma that required a change in treatment; and (4) number of days lost from work or study due to asthma. Ancillary analyses examined reasons for adoption or nonadoption of the intervention. Outcome measures were collected by online questionnaire prestudy, monthly, and poststudy. RESULTS: A total of 330 eligible participants were randomized into 1 of 2 arms (intervention: n=154; control: n=176). Access to the PCHMS was not associated with a significant difference in any of the primary or secondary outcomes. Most participants (80.5%, 124/154) did not access the intervention or accessed it only once. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the intervention being effective in other preventive care settings, system use was negligible and outcome changes were not seen as a result. Consumers must perceive the need for assistance with a task and assign priority to the task supported by the eHealth intervention. Additionally, the cost of adopting the intervention (eg, additional effort, time spent learning the new system) must be lower than the benefit. Otherwise, there is high risk consumers will not adopt the eHealth intervention.

AB: Objective: 'Move it to improve it' or Mitii is an internet based multi‐modal training program comprising upperlimb and cognitive training within the context of meaningful physical activity. This study reviews pilot data1 and proposes future research to test the efficacy of this technology. Design: Pre‐Post Pilot study. Methods: Nine children with unilateral CP (aged 9‐13y, MACs I‐II; GMFCS I‐II) underwent Mitii training at an intensity of 30 minutes/day for 20 weeks. Mitii detects bodily movements using green bands tracked by a web‐camera attached to an internet connected computer delivered in the client's home. Baseline and follow‐up assessments of motor and processing skills, self esteem, functional strength, endurance, and visual perceptual skills were conducted. Results: The feasibility of delivering Mitii was confirmed. Children completed Mitii with an average duration of 119 (8.9) days and intensity of 36.6 (3.8) minutes/day over 20 weeks. Significant improvements were seen in all assessments. All participants reported high satisfaction, maintaining engagement through the trainer's motivation in addition to the game‐like design and incremental challenges. Children performed around 135 reaching movements per session, meaning Mitii offers a model of training of sufficient intensity and duration with incremental challenges that may drive neuroplastic changes. Conclusion: An effective web based multi‐modal training that enhances motor abilities and uses virtual trainers is likely to be cost effective and lead to better translation of skills into the community as the participant is responsible for their own training in the home environment. This has significant implications for equity of access for children to this multi‐modal training. An important next step is to test the efficacy of Mitii in a larger sample. We propose to improve activity limitations (unimanual capacity and bimanual performance) on the Assisting Hand Assessment and reduce time on the Jebsen‐Taylor Test of Hand Function, and improve Motor and Process skills (AMPS) in a wait‐list design randomised controlled trial of 98 children with congenital hemiplegia. In addition, we propose improvements in executive function, activity limitations, participation, quality of life. Functional strength, fitness and translation into habitual physical activity will be assessed. The secondary aim is to further understanding of the central neurovascular mechanisms underlying changes in upper‐limb function and motor planning using advanced brain imaging. Evidence for brain reorganisation following Mitii, along with improvements in impairments, activity and participation, could revolutionise current methods of delivery of intervention.

AB: BACKGROUND: Our labor force is aging, but aged workers are not yet coached on how to stay cognitively fit for the job. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested whether a self‐motivated, complex eHealth intervention could improve multiple health‐related behaviors that are associated with cognitive aging among working Dutch adults. METHODS: This quasi‐experimental prospective study with a pre‐post design was conducted with employees of Dutch medium to large companies. All employees with Internet access, a good understanding of the Dutch language, and who provided digital informed consent were eligible to participate. In total, 2972 participants (2110/2972, 71.11% females) with a mean (standard deviation, SD) age of 51.8 (SD 12.9) years were recruited; 2305 became active users of the intervention, and 173 completed the 1‐year follow‐up. This self‐motivated eHealth lifestyle intervention stimulates participants to set personally relevant, monthly health behavior change goals using Goal Attainment Scaling and to realize these goals by implementing behavior change techniques grounded in behavior change theory. The primary outcomes were the goal‐setting success rate and the change in overall lifestyle score from baseline to the 1‐year follow‐up; the score was based on physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol, sleep, and stress scores. The secondary outcomes were the changes in body weight, body mass index, specific lifestyle characteristics, and website usage. RESULTS: A total of 1212 participants set 2620 behavior change goals; 392 participants assessed 1089 (1089/2288, 47.59%) goals and successfully achieved 422 (422/1089, 38.75%) of these goals. Among the goal‐setting participants in follow‐up, this led to a +0.81‐point improvement (95% CI 0.49‐1.13, P<.001) in overall lifestyle (d=0.32) and weight loss of 0.62 kg (95% CI ‐1.16 to ‐0.07, P=.03). These participants also showed significant improvement in 8 out of 11 specific lifestyle components. CONCLUSIONS: Among an adult Dutch population, this eHealth intervention resulted in lifestyle changes in behavioral risk factors associated with cognitive decline, and these improvements lasted over the period of 1 year. Given the general aging of our workforce, this eHealth intervention opens new avenues for the widespread use of cost‐effective self‐motivated prevention programs aimed at prevention of early‐stage cognitive decline and more self‐management of their risk factors.

AB: Introduction and Objectives: Continuing education of doctors is important for quality delivery of healthcare and surgical education opportunities for junior doctors at regional, rural and remote sites are limited. Traditional educational methods (e.g. conferences and tutorials) have many drawbacks for delivery of this type of information in a universal, standardised and timely manner and are nearly impossible in deliver in regional/remote Australia in a cost effective manner. The rapid uptake of portable media devices makes portable video media a potential alternative to current educational methods. Use of video media has been well studied in higher education and for education of patients; however there is a paucity of research for its use for continuing education of junior doctors, particularly in a regional/rural setting. Methods: Design: Prospective, multi‐centre, randomised controlled crossover trial over a 1 year period between March 2015 to March 2016. Setting: Three regional/rural hospitals: Gosford District Hospital, Wyong Hospital and Lismore Base Hospital. 49 participants (37 intern doctors and 12 final year medical students). Intervention: Surgical information regarding renal calculi and cystoscopy and ureteric stenting was delivered via portable video media (PVM), a 7 min video, compared to information delivered via standard verbal communication (SVC). Outcome measures: Knowledge acquisition was measured by a 32‐point questionnaire and satisfaction with the method of education delivery was measured using the validated Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ‐8, max score 32). Participants completed these questionnaires following first intervention and crossover to the alternate intervention. The knowledge test was also administered prior to first intervention to gauge the participant's baseline knowledge. Results: Within group analysis showed that both groups had significant increase in knowledge after first intervention, with the PVM group having a 25% increase in knowledge scores (20.18 vs. 25.14, 0.001) while the SVC group had a 16% increase in knowledge (22.67 vs. 26.26, p < 0.001). PVM was significantly more preferred than SVC with a higher CSQ‐8 score (27.96 vs. 25.48, p = 0.007). Crossover analysis revealed that participants had a significant 11% increase in satisfaction with the education process when they crossed over from SVC to PVM (25.48 vs. 28.33, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis of interns and medical students revealed the same statistical trends. Conclusions: This study is the first to demonstrate the benefits of using PVM for education of interns in a regional/rural location. Portable video media provides a novel method for providing education to interns and medical students. Our study shows portable video media improves knowledge retention and satisfaction with the educational process compared to traditional educational methods.

AB: Introduction Measuring vital signs is key to early recognition and treatment of potentially life‐threatening pregnancy complications. The CRADLE 3 trial is a stepped wedge randomised controlled trial aiming to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity by implementing a novel vital sign device (CRADLE VSA) and training package into routine obstetric care in ten low‐income sites. The training package needed to be understood and acceptable to every cadre of healthcare provider (HCP) from traditional birth attendants (TBA) in Haiti to senior obstetricians in Zimbabwe. We present the final training films in a video presentation. Methods The key components of the film script were first identified by the project management group. These covered the importance of measuring vital signs, technique for use of the CRADLE VSA and interpretation of the results. The film script was reviewed at each stage by stakeholders including implementation experts, end‐user representatives, consultants with significant global health experience and the product manufacturers. It was agreed that two film versions were appropriate, one for trained HCPs and one for HCPs with limited or no formal training such as TBAs and community volunteers. Results Animation was chosen to make the film appropriate in a wide variety of contexts, to allow easy translation of voice over into two languages and to minimise the cost of production. The film was kept as short as possible (9 and 7 min, respectively) to allow for wide dissemination to busy HCPs within the clinical environment. Reduced file size versions were made available to allow HCPs to transfer the film via Bluetooth for those with smart phones. Seven iterations of the film were required before pilot testing in three representative trial sites in Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and India. The acceptability of the film was assessed using HCP interviews. The understanding of the film was assessed using both questionnaires to assess knowledge transfer and observation of clinical practice. Results were used to inform changes to the section on interpretation of the results and ongoing management. Stakeholder review was again sought before finalisation. Conclusion The total duration of film development including the 3‐month assessment was 8 months. This process demonstrates that creation of high‐quality educational materials for use in a wide variety of contexts is achievable. The final films will be presented in this video presentation.

AB: BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are highly prevalent among college students. Most students with poor mental health, however, do not receive professional help. Internet‐based self‐help formats may increase the utilization of treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an internet‐based, app‐supported stress management intervention for college students. METHODS: College students (n=150) with elevated levels of stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4‐item version, PSS‐4 ≥8) were randomly assigned to either an internet‐ and mobile‐based stress intervention group with feedback on demand or a waitlist control group. Self‐report data were assessed at baseline, posttreatment (7 weeks), and 3‐month follow‐up. The primary outcome was perceived stress posttreatment (PSS‐4). Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and college‐related outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted in students with clinically relevant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale >17). RESULTS: A total of 106 participants (76.8%) indicated that they were first‐time help‐seekers, and 77.3% (intervention group: 58/75; waitlist control group: 58/75) showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline. Findings indicated significant effects of the intervention compared with the waitlist control group for stress (d=0.69; 95% CI 0.36‐1.02), anxiety (d=0.76; 95% CI 0.43‐1.09), depression (d=0.63; 95% CI 0.30‐0.96), college‐related productivity (d=0.33; 95% CI 0.01‐0.65), academic work impairment (d=0.34; 95% CI 0.01‐0.66), and other outcomes after 7 weeks (posttreatment). Response rates for stress symptoms were significantly higher for the intervention group (69%, 52/75) compared with the waitlist control group (35%, 26/75, P<.001; number needed to treat=2.89, 95% CI 2.01‐5.08) at posttest (7 weeks). Effects were sustained at 3‐month follow‐up, and similar findings emerged in students with symptoms of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Internet‐ and mobile‐based interventions could be an effective and cost‐effective approach to reduce consequences of college‐related stress and might potentially attract students with clinically relevant depression who would not otherwise seek help.

AB: BACKGROUND: Technological support using e‐health mobile applications (m‐health) is a promising strategy to improve the adherence to healthy lifestyles in breast cancer survivors (excess in energy intake or low physical activity are determinants of the risk of recurrence, second cancers and cancer mortality). Moreover, cancer rehabilitation programs supervised by health professionals are needed due to the inherent characteristics of these breast cancer patients. Our main objective is to compare the clinical efficacy of a m‐health lifestyle intervention system alone versus an integral strategy to improve Quality of Life in breast cancer survivors. METHODS: This therapeutic superiority study will use a two‐arm, assessor blinded parallel RCT design. Women will be eligible if: they are diagnosed of stage I, II or III‐A breast cancer; are between 25 and 75 years old; have a Body Mass Index > 25 kg/m2; they have basic ability to use mobile apps; they had completed adjuvant therapy except for hormone therapy; and they have some functional shoulder limitations. Participants will be randomized to one of the following groups: integral group will use a mobile application (BENECA APP) and will receive a face‐to‐face rehabilitation (8‐weeks); m‐health group will use the BENECA app for 2‐months and will received usual care information. Study endpoints will be assessed after 8 weeks and 6 months. The primary outcome will be Quality of Life measured by The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core and breast module. The secondary outcomes: body composition; upper‐body functionality (handgrip, Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire, goniometry); cognitive function (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Trail Making Test); anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale); physical fitness (Short version of the Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, Self‐Efficacy Scale for Physical Activity); accelerometry and lymphedema. DISCUSSION: This study has been designed to seek to address the new needs for support and treatment of breast cancer survivors, reflecting the emerging need to merge new low cost treatment options with much‐needed involvement of health professionals in this type of patients.

AB: Background: The project is a development and research project across sectors (GP, hospital and municipal nursing care) focusing on future treatment and communication with chronically ill citizens. It is planned to lead to the development of the next generation of telemedicine through a health hotspot, based on the needs of the citizens. The hotspot must support the cooperation between the health care providers as well as improve the possibility for patients to master their own illnesses. The target group is patients with diabetes, COPD, heart failure or geriatric problems. Purpose: The overall objective is to create a health sector that focuses on the needs of the patients. We want to investigate if is it possible, through telemedicine consultations and better communication between the patient and heath care providers, to lead patients to a better management of their disease. In relation to the patients with heart failure, who are part of the above‐mentioned project, our goal is to disseminate how the staff handles patients with newly diagnosed heart failure and to find the answer to the question: "Is it possible to deliver the same quality and reassurance to a patient though a monitor?" Method: A randomised study (RCT). The patients have their first consultation with the nurse in the heart failure clinic. Each patient undergoes clinical examination and receive individually structured information on the following topics: Pathophysiology Medication Mental state/adjustment Diet and physical exercise Patient compliance Perspective After giving informed consent the patients are randomly assigned to either intervention or control group. The control group is receiving the usual treatment at the hospital. The intervention group is having telemedicine equipment installed at home and is having consultations with staff from the heart failure clinic through a monitor. Prior to the consultation the patient has measured his blood pressure and weight. The nurse uses this information to adjust the medical treatment for the patient. Evaluation: The evaluation includes clinical data, number of readmissions and use of health services, combined with questionnaire and interviews about coping and quality of life. Conclusion: As the project has just started we have no conclusion, but our expectations are: Cost‐effective and time‐saving measures, while focusing on the needs of the patients Less need for readmission and health services Better cooperation between the heath care providers leading to greater coping and management in each individual patient.

AB: OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this pragmatic randomized controlled trial were to investigate the impact of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and an active social control (befriending) on depression and anxiety symptoms in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: Eligible participants were randomly allocated to receive eight weekly telephone interventions of CBT (n = 54) or befriending (n = 56). Repeated‐measures ANOVA was used to assess changes in scores and Cohen's d was used to assess effect sizes. RESULTS: Significant improvement was observed in anxiety symptoms for the befriending group from baseline (T1) to post‐intervention assessment (T2) and to 8‐week follow‐up assessment (T3), with a small to medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.3). Significant improvement was noted in depression symptoms from T1 to T2 for both groups, but only the CBT group had a significant difference at T3, with a small to medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.4). For secondary outcomes, there was a significant change in COPD symptoms from T1 to T2 for the befriending group; however, at T3 this change was no longer significant. Finally, there was a significant change in general self‐efficacy for both groups between T1 and T2, and T1 and T3. CONCLUSION: Cognitive behaviour therapy reduced depression symptoms but not anxiety. Befriending reduced depression symptoms in the short term and anxiety symptoms in both the short term and long term. Further research is needed to demonstrate non‐inferiority of telephone delivery compared with other formats, and to understand the impact of befriending which has the potential to be a cost‐effective support for people with COPD. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Depression and anxiety are common comorbidities in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mood disorders are not commonly routinely treated in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Telephone‐administered CBT has been shown to be as effective as face‐to‐face CBT in reducing depression and anxiety. What does this study add? Telephone‐administered CBT can reduce depression symptoms in people with COPD. Telephone‐administered befriending can reduce anxiety and depression symptoms in people with COPD. People with COPD who have mood disorders would prefer to have CBT than befriending.

KY: Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Disease; Myocardial Ischemia
AB: Patients at high risk of having one or more coronary stenosis are evaluated routinely by invasive coronary angiography (CAG). Lesions are often quantified by visual assessment of the angiogram, but physiological assessment of the functional significance by fractional flow reserve has been shown to improve clinical outcome, to reduce number of stents implanted, and has obtained the highest recommendation in European guidelines. FFR is assessed during CAG by advancing a wire with a pressure transducer towards the stenosis and measure the ratio in pressure between the two sides of the stenosis during medical induced maximum blood flow (hyperaemia). The solid evidence for FFR evaluation of coronary stenosis and the relative simplicity in performing the measurements have supported adoption of an FFR based strategy but the need for interrogating the stenosis by a pressure wire, the small risks associated hereto, the cost of the wire, and the drug inducing hyperaemia has limited more widespread adoption. Quantitative Flow Ratio is a novel method for evaluating the functional significance of coronary stenosis by calculation of the pressure drop in the vessel based on computation of two angiographic projections. Two multi‐center studies, the FAVOR II Europe‐Japan and China studies evaluated the feasibility and diagnostic performance of in‐procedure QFR, showing very good agreement between QFR and FFR. The purpose of the FAVOR III Europe Japan study is to investigate if a QFR‐based diagnostic strategy yields non‐inferior 12‐month clinical outcome compared to a standard pressure‐wire guided strategy in evaluation of patients with stable angina pectoris and intermediate coronary stenosis. Primary hypothesis: A QFR based diagnostic strategy results in non‐inferior clinical outcome, assessed by a composite endpoint of all cause death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and unplanned revascularization after one year, compared to a strategy of pressure wire‐based FFR for assessment of physiological significance of intermediate coronary artery stenosis. Methods: Investigator initiated, 1:1 randomized, prospective, clinical outcome, non‐inferiority, multi‐center trial performed at up to 40 international sites with inclusion of 2000 patients. Patients with stable angina pectoris or need for evaluation of non‐culprit lesions after acute MI are enrolled. At least two angiographic projections are acquired during resting conditions. If the angiographic criteria are met, the patient is randomized to either a QFR‐ or an FFR‐based diagnostic strategy. Revascularization is performed according to best standard by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patient follow‐up is continued until 24 months.

AB: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate methods for lowering cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in asymptomatic urban and rural underserved subjects. BACKGROUND: Medically underserved populations are at increased CVD risk, and systems to lower CVD risk are needed. Nurse management (NM) and telemedicine (T) systems may provide low‐cost solutions for this care. METHODS: We randomized 465 subjects without overt CVD, with Framingham CVD risk >10% to NM with 4 visits over 1 year, or NM plus T to facilitate weight, blood pressure (BP), and physical activity reporting. The study goal was to reduce CVD risk by 5%. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty‐eight subjects completed the study. Cardiovascular disease risk fell by ≥ 5% in 32% of the NM group and 26% of the T group (P, nonsignificant). In hyperlipidemic subjects, total cholesterol decreased (NM ‐21.9 ± 39.4, T ‐22.7 ± 41.3 mg/dL) significantly. In subjects with grade II hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 160 mm Hg, 24% of subjects), both NM and T groups had a similar BP response (average study BP: NM 147.4 ± 17.5, T 145.3. ± 18.4, P is nonsignificant), and for those with grade I hypertension (37% of subjects), T had a lower average study BP compared to NM (NM 140.4 ± 16.9, T 134.6 ± 15.0, P = .058). In subjects at high risk (Framingham score ≥ 20%), risk fell 6.0% ± 9.9%; in subjects at intermediate risk (Framingham score ≥ 10, < 20), risk fell 1.3% ± 4.5% (P < .001 compared to high‐risk subjects). Medication adherence was similar in both high‐ and intermediate‐risk subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In 2 underserved populations, CVD risk was reduced by a nurse intervention; T did not add to the risk improvement. Reductions in BP and blood lipids occurred in both high‐ and intermediate‐risk subjects with greatest reductions noted in the high‐risk subjects. Frequent communication using a nurse intervention contributes to improved CVD risk in asymptomatic, underserved subjects with increased CVD risk. Telemedicine did not change the effectiveness of the nurse intervention.

AB: The standard paradigm for cancer susceptibility genetic testing has been for patients to 1) be identified by their provider as being at high risk due to extensive family history or another diagnosis (e.g., breast cancer for ovarian risk testing), and 2) attend in‐person pre and post‐genetic test sessions with a genetic counselor to prepare for testing and learn about the results. This arrangement places boundaries around the types of women willing to spend this time and effort receiving testing, as providers are required to act as gatekeepers to the testing process. More open methods of accessing genetic testing and providing support need to be evaluated. We propose to deliver personal, risk‐based genetic testing and results to women from the general public using the Internet. Internet‐based services offer several advantages over either in‐person or telephone interventions. First, information can be accessed by participants and providers on their own schedules, at any location with internet access, and can be consumed at the pace and style that is best for individual tastes and styles. If necessary, information and support can be re‐reviewed if the patient does not remember the initial counseling session. Second, delivery of information through the internet can be performed in a more efficient and cost‐effective manner, reserving the limited in‐person genetic counseling for individuals who need it the most, while providing support to the general public about basic medical and risk‐based information. Recruitment via social media outlets can directly link potential participants to the Internet systems that screen for eligibility and provide testing support. Finally, Internet delivery can bring genetic testing to the patient in their home, eliminating a major barrier to testing (multiple visits to the provider) The main objective of MAGENTA is to test the effects of on‐line genetic education versus telephone genetic counseling on cancer distress and other psychological outcomes. We will recruit women using social media and other eHealth methods to participate in a randomized trial of ovarian cancer counseling and testing that is conducted online and using the telephone. We will conduct a (2x2 factorial design) randomized trial to test online versus telephone pre‐and post‐test genetic counseling for ovarian cancer risk among women at higher than average risk for ovarian cancer. We expect to enroll 3000 women through our media contacts to participate in MAGENTA. For genetic risk assessment, we will evaluate and provide feedback on 19 breast and ovarian cancer (OC) genes that have a clear relationship to cancer risk in collaboration with Color Genomics. Variants include ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, EPCAM, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, TP53, and STK1. We will follow women for main psychological outcomes at 3 months post testing and longer for other outcomes.

AB: The intensification of the management for the control of glycaemia and other risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2) results in a reduction of diabetes‐related complications. The strategy to increase the competences of primary care professionals to improve health care has been mainly prompted by the current context of limited resources and restricted access to specialty care. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of an integral intervention carried out by primary care professionals with the following components: 1. detection of patients with poor diabetic control; 2. introduction of a specific consultation on diabetes followed by virtual and telephone specialist support; 3. introduction of other measures to overcome patients and professionals barriers to treatment. The main objective of the study is to determine if glycaemic control as measured by the mean concentration of HbA1c of poorly controlled patients improves when these patients are evaluated and treated in primary care under the integral strategy proposed in this study. The INTEGRA project also includes Phase 1 (qualitative research study), which is aimed at identifying viable strategies to suppress barriers to treatment; these strategies have been included to the intervention study (phase 2). Phase 2 is a controlled, quasi‐experimental intervention that involves 9 primary care centres of 3 regions (Lleida, Girona, Barcelona). The participants are patients with DM2 with poor glycaemic control that meet all the inclusion criteria and sign the informed consent. The intervention study will have three arms: (1) Control Group; (2) Intervention Group 1 (diabetes specific consultation + additional measures originated in phase 1; and (3) Intervention Group 2 (additional measures originated in phase 1). Phase 1 has been conducted during the last 6 months previous to the initiation of the proposed intervention study and consisted of a qualitative design (individualized interviews with randomly selected patients in each of the participating centers); this qualitative study has contributed to design the final intervention applied on phase 2, particularly, implementing additional measures as coaching sessions to health professionals of the participating centers and automated messaging to patients with reminder and motivational objectives. Phase 2 consists of a recruitment period of 6 months, followed by a 12‐month follow‐up for each patient

DOI: 10.1159/000447505
AB: Introduction: The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has become the treatment of choice for patients at risk for potentially lethal ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Despite this medical success, ICD patients often suffer from anxiety (up to 87 %), anxiety disorders (up to 38 %) and depression (up to 30 %). Routine medical care typically lacks the resources for appropriate psychosocial support. Limited mobility and low regional availability of self‐help groups suggest internet‐based support as an ideal supplement to traditional support models. Methods: To investigate whether web‐based support can help to prevent anxiety and depression and to improve quality of life in ICD‐patients, we have developed ICD‐Forum. de, a six‐week internet based prevention program providing technical and medical information regarding the ICD and cognitive behavioral‐therapy based self‐help materials. Integrated in this program is a professionally moderated virtual self‐help group. ICD‐Forum. de has been evaluated on N = 119 ICD‐patients in a multi‐center, multi‐disciplinary, half‐open, part‐randomized, controlled clinical trial. Demographic and medical variables and psychosocial well‐being has been assessed at baseline, before and after treatment, and at 12‐month follow‐up in two groups (random assignment to treatment as usual [TAU] vs. TAU plus participation in ICD‐Forum. de; stratification by age, sex, and ICD‐indication). Results: Comparison of data pre‐ to post‐intervention (intent to treat analysis: ANCOVA with covariates preTx, age, sex, ICD‐indication) revealed a significant improvement of psychosocial well‐being (composite score of heart related anxiety, depression, quality of life) that improved further at follow up (12 months after baseline) in the intervention group as compared to the control group. Conclusion: This is the first successful implementation of web‐care for ICD‐patients, resulting in a large effect on psychosocial well‐being. We conclude that helping ICD‐patients with low‐cost web‐based approaches is feasible and effective. This recommends integrating such an approach in routine care of ICD‐patients.

AB: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Over 3.5 million male cancer survivors in the United States have sexual dysfunction. Problems include erectile dysfunction (ED) and also loss of sexual desire, alterations in orgasm, and pain or incontinence during sex. hardtimes: Cancer and Men's Sexual Health is an Internet intervention that educates about sexual side effects of cancer treatments, guides men and partners in choosing treatment options for ED, presents cognitive‐behavioral sex therapy exercises, and includes videotaped patient stories. METHODS: Eighty‐five men seeking help from a urologist in a cancer center were randomized to usual care or to access hardtimes and receive up to 6 h of phone coaching. Self‐report questionnaires were completed at baseline, and 12 and 24 weeks. RESULTS: With 64% having completed participation, 11% dropped out and average web site usage is 56 min (range 1‐214).Multivariable analyses will test the hypothesis that duration of web site usage and phone coaching predict improvement in sexual function/satisfaction. Program ratings and usability testing are complete. A large pragmatic trial will begin in 2015 of an updated site optimized for use on mobile devices, with improved navigation and search features. CONCLUSIONS: Creating an evidence‐based Internet intervention requires repeated evaluations of both patient engagement and efficacy. Only a subgroup of men can change focus from a mechanical fix for ED to broader goals of better sexual communication and satisfaction. Research Implications: Men have a variety of unmet needs relating to sexual problems that depend on recency of diagnosis and desire to prevent or improve an actual sexual dysfunction. Cultural and relationship issues are also highly relevant. The value of an Internet‐based intervention is not only based on efficacy to improve behavior and emotional distress, but also on ease of use, actual engagement with the intervention, and ratings of whether it is helpful. Practice Implications: A comprehensive Internet intervention for cancer‐related sexual problems in men can reduce barriers to finding timely information and effective professional help. It can be used as self‐help or supplemented with telehealth counseling. The program also provides a cost‐effective tool for training oncology health professionals to do a better job of assessing and providing treatment for sexual problems.

AB: Background & Objectives: Worldwide there is extensive morbidity due to musculoskeletal pain. This is problematic in developing countries due to the high cost and access to therapy. Agnikarma is an ancient surgical treatment for pain (1). It involves thermal cauterization (first or second degree burn) delivered precisely to the trigger point in the area of allodynia. Advances in herbal cream for burns has facilitated a revival and re evaluation of this technique. Our objective was to document that the technique can improve pain management for patients. In addition we set out to establish a clinical evidence base that was appropriate to time and place. This environment is not suitable for a randomised trial but holds the potential to make a significant statement on efficacy nonetheless. We set up the global Agnikarma centre ‐ www. globalagnikarma.com to offer the treatment. Materials & Methods: The international consultants (authors) experts in pain medicine and holistic medicine agreed a protocol whereby the same clinical information was collected on every patient at each visit setting up an extensive clinical database. Furthermore an extensive video library of pre and post treatment records was generated. Having learned the technique the presenting author offered the treatment to a specific group of patients in Ireland. These patients all had a diagnosis of chronic pain and had failed all conventional pain management. They all had graduated from a cognitive behavioural pain management programme. 100 patients were invited to visit the web site and self select for treatment. Results: We treated 14173 patients with 39658 procedures as of 21‐2‐2016 over a two year period. The case mix was 50% knee, 25% lumbar spine, 15% shoulder & neck and 10 % miscellaneous. The average number of treatment sessions is three (range 1‐6) to achieve benefit. In Ireland the one year audit data for resistant chronic pain ‐ 51 patients self selected, 25 were deemed suitable and completed 4 sessions. 76% had greater than 50 % pain relief, 80% had improved function, 30 % had improved sleep, 60 % stated that the benefit was still present at the end of the year, 80 % would have the procedure again. Conclusion: We have introduced a novel interventional pain therapy which offers hope to patients suffering from pain as it is simple efficacious and sustained. We have set up a transparent clinical data base complemented by a clinical video library which can be audited by interested parties. We have piloted a sample audit in resistant chronic pain patients where no efficacy would be anticipated in a totally different environment and documented benefit. There is now sufficient proof of concept for a more detailed investigation.

AB: Introduction: Cost‐effectiveness of medical care can potentially be enhanced by utilizing automate mechanisms to provide patient education and assist in follow‐up care. We explore the impact of interactive web based educational programs (Web Education) to assist in patient education, and interactive voice response surveys (IVR) to assist in follow‐up of patients newly initiated on CPAP therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: We pseudo‐randomized patients with suspected OSA appropriate for home testing into: 1) Traditional Management based on ofice encounters with case‐managers (OSA class, home sleep testing, home CPAP trial, and 3 month follow‐up) and 2) Telemedicine Management which utilizes the same sequence of ofice encounters but pre‐educates patients with "OSA" Web Education prior to initial OSA class and with "CPAP" Web Education in those that test positive for OSA during their home CPAP trial; in patients prescribed CPAP for long‐term therapy, automated IVR survey is telephoned to patients 4 times in 3 months asking questions regarding CPAP use. Three‐month CPAP use was compared between the two groups. Results: At time of interim analysis, 1406 (676 Telemedicine; 735 Traditional) patients were scheduled for OSA class. "No show" rate to initial OSA class was signiicantly lower in Telemedicine group (30% vs. 40%; p = 0.0001). Proportion of patients with OSA agreeing to longterm CPAP therapy were similar (92.8% vs. 84.4%; p = 0.14), while percentage of patients adherent with keeping their 3 month follow‐up appointment (51.1% vs. 45.2%; p = 0.55) was also similar. Of the patients with 3 month follow‐up (n = 46 vs. 33), mean CPAP use was signiicantly higher in the Telemedicine group (4.6 +/‐ 2.0 vs 3.5 +/‐ 1.8 hours; p = 0.02). Rate of viewing "OSA" Web Education program was 50% and "CPAP" program was 10%. 91% of patients completing 3‐month follow‐up responded to at least 1 IVR call. Conclusion: Our interim analysis demonstrates that automated educational and follow‐up mechanisms improve patient engagement with improved adherence to initial evaluation and to CPAP use, even though patient utilization of the automated programs was incomplete.

AB: A biennial guaiac‐based fecal occult blood test (FOBT) colorectal cancer (CRC) screening program is organized in Alsace (France) since 2003. Average risk residents aged 50‐74 are invited by mail to participate. FOBT kits are first offered by general practitioners and then mailed directly to non‐compliers. The uptake was considered insufficient in the last round, estimated between 40 and 52% depending on the geographic area. Aim: to assess whether tailored telephone counseling could increase the uptake in underusers. Methods: Never users and former users (>30 months since last FOBT) were randomized in a control group with usual recall letter and direct mailing of FOBT kits (C) and two intervention groups, using either a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) system for tailored promotion of CRC screening, or a telephone‐based motivational interview (MI). Results: The perprotocol analysis showed that the uptake was significantly higher in both intervention groups, without significant difference between CATI (23.9%)(95% CI 21.7‐26.2) and MI (24.6%)(95% CI 22.4‐26.8)(average length, 8.2 minutes for both), than in the control group (9.7%)(95% CI 9.1‐10.3) (p<0.001). However, a minority of people could be actually reached (23.2%) and counseled (15.8%), so that the uptake was significantly higher in the control group (9.7%)(95% CI 9.1‐10.3) than in the intervention groups (4.8%)(95% CI 4.4‐ 5.1)(p<0.001) in the intent‐to‐treat analysis. The uptake was higher in former users (71.2%) than in never users (18.6%) and in people older than 60 years (28.4%) than in younger people (20.8%)(p<0.001) without significant difference between men and women (24.9% vs 23.8%) (per‐protocol analysis). Conclusions: The efficacy of tailored telephone counseling to lead underusers to participate in an organized FOBT CRC screening program is 2.5 times greater than that of a recall letter with direct mailing of FOBT kits. It is not significantly different between MI and CATI so that MI training of counselors is useless. However, telephone counseling cannot be recommended to date in France as it is neither effective nor cost‐effective because people are difficult to reach (one in four) and to counsel (two out of three people reached) by phone.

AB: Introduction & Objective: Surgical telementoring by videoconferencing was first described in the sixties. There is renewed interest in telemedicine solutions in surgical training with evidence that telementoring is cost‐effective and safe, leading to the launch of a national US research initiative. Nonetheless, there is still insufficient data on educational outcomes. Recently, a telemedical device (Omnistrator®, Omnitivity Inc, Boston, USA) has allowed surgeons to bi‐directionally annotate over a delay free video stream and communicate with audio. Our aim was to assess telementoring techniques for training surgeons performing Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumour (TURBT). Methods: A trainee surgeon was given instructions on the steps of surgery and randomly assigned either traditional (verbal), or telementoring supervision (verbal + visual annotation). Inclusion criteria: elective cases for primary or follow up single TURBT with a size of up to 3cms; and exclusion criteria: nonelective/ emergency cases, multiple tumours, or tumour over 3 cms. The TURBT procedure was performed in a modular/stepwise manner to allow comparison of outcomes. Set up: A tablet device (Mentor controlled) was wirelessly and securely connected to the secondary operating screen Omnistrator ®. Bidirectional audio, video and annotation was then available for mentor and trainee. Outcome measure: we compared surgical performance of a trainee surgeon, with and without telementoring. Study size: we evaluated 10 traditionally supervised and 10 telementored TURBT as a pilot study. Results: Telestration during TURBT statistically improved (see table) the superficial (p < 0.001) and deep bladder (p < 0.001) resection; bladder biopsy (p < 0.04); knowledge of anatomy (p < 0.0002); and overall precision of the procedure (p < 0.0001). There was no difference in complications or safety. Trainees reported a preference for telestration, as the surgical area of interest on the operating screen was highlighted by annotation, allowing time to assess and plan the next surgical step. The supervising surgeon did not need to physically operate in any telestrated case (n = 10); but did so in traditional cases (n = 4). Conclusions: Our initial experience shows telestration using an Omnistrator is safe and effective for improving training of TURBT and was well received by our trainees. (Figure Presented).

AB: Preliminary Evaluation of an Adult Asthma Adherence Management Program Adults with asthma take less that 50% of their prescribed medication. The Asthma Adherence Management Program (AAMP) has been shown to be effective in uncontrolled studies of pediatric and adult patients, in both increasing adherence and reducing emergency care. The AAMP was converted to a web‐app format (Asthma Adherence Pathway) to permit use in future telemedicine studies. The focus of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the web‐app AAMP by means of a randomized controlled trial of adult asthma patients with persistent disease. All study interactions were in person. Methods: Thirty‐three subjects (15 Treatment and 18 Control; mean age 42yrs (20‐69); Gender: 12M; 21F) were randomly assigned and completed a 3‐month nested prospective study of the AAMP. Treatment and Control physicians utilized Dulera 100/200 following NHLBI guidelines. Asthma Control Questionnaires (ACQs) were completed at baseline and at the end of study. Treatment and Control subjects had poor asthma control at baseline (ACQ >1.0 units). Treatment subjects completed the AAMP, identifying adherence barriers (Domains: asthma management, cost, psychological, QoL, support, comprehension and environment). Clinicians applied Motivational Interviewing adherence strategies specific to barrier(s) identified. Treatment subjects were monitored monthly for Dulera adherence by the SmartInhaler and dose counter and given feedback regarding adherence findings. Treatment adherence was determined by the mean of 4 measures over 3‐months. Control subjects were not monitored for Dulera adherence. Results: Mean Treatment Dulera adherence in the intervention group was 84% (44‐99). ACQ range 1.1‐4.57. Means at baseline for the Treatment group ACQ(MTx=1.99, SD=0.88) and Control ACQ(MC =1.51, SD=0.90) subjects did not differ on ACQ scores (t(31)=1.53, p=0.14). A repeated measures ANOVA with a within‐subjects (study entry vs. study end) and a between‐subjects (Treatment vs. Control) factor was performed on the ACQ outcome. The time∗group interaction was significant (F(1,24)=13.32, p=0.001) indicating Treatment subjects showed greater improvement (0.92 ACQ units) than asthma control (0.03 ACQ units). Conclusions: Treatment physicians implementing Asthma Adherence Pathway were successful in promoting Dulera adherence for the Treatment group and improving Treatment group asthma control compared to subjects in the Control group.

AB: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a primary prevention care model using telephone support delivered through an existing health call centre to general practitioner‐referred patients at risk of developing CVD, using objective measures of CVD risk reduction and weight loss. DESIGN: Participants were randomised into two groups: (i) those receiving a telephone‐supported comprehensive lifestyle intervention programme (CLIP: written structured diet and exercise advice, plus seven telephone sessions with the Heart Foundation Health Information Service); and (ii) those receiving usual care from their general practitioner (control: written general lifestyle advice). Fasting plasma lipids, blood pressure, weight, waist circumference and height were assessed on general practice premises by a practice nurse at Weeks 0 and 12. SETTING: Two general practices in Adelaide, South Australia. SUBJECTS: Forty‐nine men and women aged 48·0 (sd 5·88) years identified by their general practitioner as being at future risk of CVD (BMI = 33·13 (sd 5·39) kg/m2; LDL cholesterol (LDL‐C) = 2·66 (sd 0·92) mmol/l). RESULTS: CLIP participants demonstrated significantly greater reductions in LDL‐C (estimated mean (EM) = 1·98 (se 0·17) mmol/l) and total cholesterol (EM = 3·61 (se 0·21) mmol/l) at Week 12 when compared with the control group (EM = 3·23 (se 0·18) mmol/l and EM = 4·77 (se 0·22) mmol/l, respectively). There were no significant treatment effects for systolic blood pressure (F(1,45) = 0·28, P = 0·60), diastolic blood pressure (F(1,43) = 0·52, P = 0·47), weight (F(1,42) = 3·63, P = 0·063) or waist circumference (F(1,43) = 0·32, P = 0·577). CONCLUSIONS: In general practice patients, delivering CLIP through an existing telephone health service is effective in achieving reductions in LDL‐C and total cholesterol. While CLIP may have potential for wider implementation to support primary prevention of CVD, longer‐term cost‐effectiveness data are warranted.

AB: Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders among youth, with lifetime prevalence ranging between 18‐20% of the general population. Among anxiety disorders, social anxiety disorder (SAD) affects 8% of all youth, resulting in significant short and long‐term impairment, including increased likelihood of substance abuse, limited academic achievement, attenuated occupational functioning, and impaired or missing social relationships. Emerging data suggest that interventions that include social skills training, formal peer generalization sessions, and homework assignments as part of an overall treatment strategy show enhanced efficacy when compared to interventions without these components ‐ the latter two elements which are designed to enhance skill generalization. Two critical treatment elements (peer generalization, homework assignments) are difficult to implement in traditional clinical settings, limiting optimal dissemination to youth in need of these services in different settings (e.g., at school, outpatient, or community facilities). In a recently completed Phase I STTR, the investigators developed and validated an interactive virtual environment (VE) to solve the need for intensive behavioral practice opportunities that are critical for skill generalization. The VE, known as Pegasys‐VR™, allowed intensive practice of social skills without the need for formal peer group activities (in clinic solution) or intensive parental involvement (at‐home solution). The results indicated that implementing a VE environment into the SET‐C program was accessible, credible and feasible for the parents, clinicians and children who participated in the trial. Furthermore, examination of within group changes indicated statistically significant improvement in SAD symptoms. Given the success of the Phase I, and the need to increase the automation of the system to increase its acceptance and adoption among clinicians and socially anxiety youth, the Phase II STTR study will have the following goals: incorporate an artificial intelligence natural language system, develop additional VEs for in‐clinic practice, expand the homework solution to provide additional opportunities to reinforce skills acquisition and generalization practice in in‐vivo settings, using serious game theory and technology, and conduct a randomized controlled trial with youth ages 7 to 12 to test whether Pegasys‐VR™ is as effective as a traditional behavioral interventions for youth with social anxiety disorder and if the effects are maintained at 3 month follow‐up. If Pegasys‐VR™ is clinically efficacious, it would offer a sustainable, cost‐effective intervention that can be easily and rapidly disseminated.

TI: Using Technology to Augment the Implementation and Effectiveness of PCIT
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct01294488
YR: 2011
AB: Parent‐Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an empirically supported behavioral parent training program for reducing aggressive behavior in young children and for reducing future rates of child physical abuse. Prior research has found that an adapted version of PCIT developed specifically for violent parents in the child welfare system reduced future child physical abuse recurrence rates from 49% to 19%. OUHSC/CCAN researchers, in prior and ongoing studies, have found the benefits of PCIT to be durable over time and to generalize across settings and across children in the same family. Culturally‐specific adaptations of PCIT and adaptations for older abused children and their abusive parents have been developed. A number of blue‐ribbon panels have recommended PCIT for widespread dissemination in child abuse prevention and intervention service systems, but uptake of PCIT has been limited. One reason for this is that the traditional PCIT practitioner training models are not easily replicable in field settings. PCIT has historically been taught in University‐based training programs (graduate programs, internships, etc.) and includes several months of co‐therapy mentoring where trainers work directly with trainees during live sessions. In contrast, given the difficulties of conducting co‐therapy mentoring in field settings, training for widespread implementation has generally involved initial training in the model followed by phone consultation. OUHSC/CCAN researchers have pilot‐ and feasibility tested a system using internet‐based telemedicine technology to deliver live, mentored PCIT training. OUHSC/CCAN researchers have piloted Remote Real‐Time (RRT) training at sites in Utah, Seattle, Alaska, Oregon, and Oklahoma. Feasibility appears excellent, and the approach has been well received. Moreover, RRT implementation revealed misapplications of the model that had gone unaddressed in phone consultation. This research project will make use of planned, funded PCIT start‐up implementations at 20‐24 agency sites in Washington and Oklahoma. Study participants will include agency practitioners engaged in implementing the PCIT model and families receiving PCIT services at these community agencies. Using a multilevel interrupted time series randomized design; the study will compare the RRT implementation approach with standard phone consultation (PC). Outcomes will include practitioner fidelity and competency in implementing PCIT, practitioner acceptance and satisfaction with PCIT, and family outcomes of parental skill acquisition, parent satisfaction, child aggressive and oppositional behaviors, and rates of future child welfare abuse reports. A mediational model is proposed in which differences in client outcomes are mediated by improved practitioner fidelity and competency. Cost effectiveness and practitioner response to the implementation approach will be examined. The study thus will inform strategies for facilitating widespread dissemination and implementation with fidelity of the evidence‐based PCIT model, thereby making the model available to a broader range of agencies and practitioners working with at‐risk families.

DOI: 10.2196/jmir.2328
AB: BACKGROUND: Mobile phone‐based assessment may represent a cost‐effective and clinically effective method of monitoring psychotic symptoms in real‐time. There are several software options, including the use of native smartphone applications and text messages (short message service, SMS). Little is known about the strengths and limitations of these two approaches in monitoring symptoms in individuals with serious mental illness. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare two different delivery modalities of the same diagnostic assessment for individuals with non‐affective psychosis‐a native smartphone application employing a graphical, touch user interface against an SMS text‐only implementation. The overall hypothesis of the study was that patient participants with sewrious mental illness would find both delivery modalities feasible and acceptable to use, measured by the quantitative post‐assessment feedback questionnaire scores, the number of data points completed, and the time taken to complete the assessment. It was also predicted that a native smartphone application would (1) yield a greater number of data points, (2) take less time, and (3) be more positively appraised by patient participant users than the text‐based system. METHODS: A randomized repeated measures crossover design was employed. Participants with currently treated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fourth Edition) schizophrenia or related disorders (n=24) were randomly allocated to completing 6 days of assessment (four sets of questions per day) with a native smartphone application or the SMS text‐only implementation. There was then a 1‐week break before completing a further 6 days with the alternative delivery modality. Quantitative feedback questionnaires were administered at the end of each period of sampling. RESULTS: A greater proportion of data points were completed with the native smartphone application in comparison to the SMS text‐only implementation (β = ‐.25, SE=.11, P=.02), which also took significantly less time to complete (β =.78, SE= .09, P<.001). Although there were no significant differences in participants' quantitative feedback for the two delivery modalities, most participants reported preferring the native smartphone application (67%; n=16) and found it easier to use (71%; n=16). 33% of participants reported that they would be willing to complete mobile phone assessment for 5 weeks or longer. CONCLUSIONS: Native smartphone applications and SMS text are both valuable methods of delivering real‐time assessment in individuals with schizophrenia. However, a more streamlined graphical user interface may lead to better compliance and shorter entry times. Further research is needed to test the efficacy of this technology within clinical services, to assess validity over longer periods of time and when delivered on patients' own phones.

The study was conducted within Kaiser Permanente Colorado, a large, group‐model health maintenance organization. A total of 1187 children aged 3 to 12 years with a persistent asthma diagnosis and prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid were randomized to the computerized SR intervention or usual care condition and followed up for 24 months between October 2009 and February 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Speech recognition telephone calls to parents in the intervention condition were triggered when an inhaled corticosteroid refill was due or overdue. Calls were automatically tailored with medical and demographic information from the electronic health record and from parent answers to questions in the call regarding recent refills or a desire to receive help refilling, learn more about asthma control, or speak with an asthma nurse or pharmacy staff member. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Adherence to pediatric asthma controller medication, measured as the medication possession ratio over 24 months. RESULTS: In the intention‐to‐treat analysis, inhaled corticosteroid adherence was 25.4% higher in the intervention group than in the usual care group (24‐month mean [SE] adherence, 44.5% [1.2%] vs 35.5% [1.1%], respectively; P < .001). Asthma‐related urgent care events did not differ between the 2 groups. The intervention effect was consistent in subgroups stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and disease‐related characteristics. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The intervention's significant impact on adherence demonstrates strong potential for low‐cost SR adherence programs integrated with an electronic health record. The absence of change in urgent care visits may be attributable to the already low number of asthma urgent care visits within Kaiser Permanente Colorado. Application of electronic health record‐leveraged SR interventions may reduce health care utilization when applied in a population with less‐controlled asthma.

AB: Objective: To evaluate the impact of "My Care My Call" (MCMC), a peer‐led, telephone‐based health self‐management intervention in adults with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Design: Single‐blinded randomized controlled trial. Setting: General community. Participants: Convenience sample of adults with SCI (N=84; mean time post‐SCI, 9.9y; mean age, 46y; 73.8% men; 44% with paraplegia; 58% white). Interventions: Trained peer health coaches applied the person‐centered health self‐management intervention with 42 experimental subjects over 6 months on a tapered call schedule. The 42 control subjects received usual care. Both groups received the MCMC Resource Guide. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome‐health self‐management as measured by the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). Secondary outcomes‐global ratings of service/resource use, health‐related quality of life, and quality of primary care. Results: Intervention participants averaged 12 calls over 6 months (averaging 21.8min each), with distinct variation. At 6 months, intervention participants reported a significantly greater change in PAM scores (6mo: estimate, 7.029; 95% confidence interval, .1018‐13.956; P=.0468) compared with controls, with a trend toward significance at 4 months. At 6 months, intervention participants reported a significantly greater decrease in social/role activity limitations (estimate, ‐.443; P=.0389), greater life satisfaction (estimate, 1.0091; P=.0522), greater services/resources awareness (estimate, 1.678; P=.0253), greater overall service use (estimate, 1.069; P=.0240), and a greater number of services used (estimate, 1.542; P=.0077). Subgroups most impacted by MCMC on PAM change scores included the following: high social support, white persons, men, 1 to 6 years postinjury, and tetraplegic. Conclusions: This trial demonstrates that the MCMC peer‐led, health self‐management intervention achieved a positive impact on self‐management to prevent secondary conditions in adults with SCI. These results warrant a larger, multisite trial of its efficacy and cost‐effectiveness. Copyright © 2017 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

TI: Sensory Stimulation to Enhance Hand Function Post Stroke

YR: 2016
KY: Stroke
AB: Stroke survivors suffer from persistent hand impairment that diminishes their functional abilities and independence, despite multiple courses of rehabilitation. Sensory stimulation can prime central excitability to increase therapy outcome. The investigators developed a new sensory stimulation technique for the hand, using imperceptible vibration applied to the wrist skin. Wearable devices with a vibrating function are low cost and can be easily adopted for rehabilitation purposes to impact a wide range of patients with sensorimotor impairment. Despite the potential for clinical benefits and easy adoption for high impact, knowledge about the long‐term efficacy of this new sensory stimulation technique and its underlying mechanism is limited. The objective of this pilot project is to assess the impact of the novel sensory stimulation technique the investigators have developed in enhancing outcomes of 2‐week hand therapy as well as the central nervous system responsiveness in chronic stroke survivors. This impact will be assessed in a double‐blind stratified randomized controlled trial. The hypothesis is that (a) improvement in hand function will be greater for the experimental group receiving the wrist subthreshold vibrotactile stimulation during therapy compared with the control group who will wear the device with no vibration (placebo). (b) Improvement in hand function is associated with neurophysiologic measures of central nervous system responsiveness. Clinical and neurophysiologic evaluations will be performed before, immediately after, and 2 weeks after a 2 week standardized hand therapy program with the subthreshold vibrotactile stimulation to the wrist vs. sham. The investigators preliminary studies demonstrated an acute effect of the remote subthreshold vibrotactile stimulation on immediately improved clinical sensory and motor function of the hand as well as cortical excitability in healthy young adults and chronic stroke survivors in single‐session studies. The expected outcome is the demonstration that the subthreshold vibrotactile stimulation at the wrist enhances hand function, not only immediately (preliminary studies) but also as a complement to therapy in chronic stroke survivors. This project will also provide preliminary insights regarding plasticity occurring with hand therapy augmented by the subthreshold vibrotactile stimulation. This research will have a positive impact by leading to a portable sensorimotor orthosis worn at the wrist to improve hand function for patients with sensorimotor deficits.

AB: Results: Objective: We aimed to assess the feasibility and the efficacy of the home use of a PDA‐phone on glucose control in patients with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes (T1D) Research design and Methods: Adult patients (n=180) with T1D (> 1 year), aged 34 A+/‐ 13 years, on a basal‐bolus insulin regimen (> 6 months), with A1c > 8%, were randomized to: 1) continuation of usual quarterly follow‐up (G1), 2) home use of a PDA‐phone uploaded with Diabeo software suggesting insulin doses according to personally‐tailored algorithms talking into account home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM), CHO counting and physical exercise, associated with quarterly visits (G2), 3) similar use of the PDA‐phone but with data teletransmission to care providers via internet and short teleconsultations via phone calls every 2 weeks but no visit (G3) for 6 months. Results: Six month mean HbA1c in G3 (8.41% A+/‐ 1.04%) was lower than in G1 (9.10% A+/‐ 1.16%; p = 0.0019). G2 displayed intermediate results (8.63 % A+/‐ 1.07%). HbA1c decreased from baseline by 0.49% A+/‐ 0.89% (p<0.001) in G2 and 0.73% A+/‐ 0.84 (p<0.001) in G3; no improvement was seen for G1 (+0.18% A+/‐ 0.93%). The Diabeo system gave a 0.91% [0.60; 1.21] or 0.67% [0.35; 0.99] improvement over controls, when used with (G3) or without (G2) teleconsultation. There was no difference in the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes or in medical time spent for hospital or telephone consultations (1.2 hour in all groups), whereas patients in G1 and G2 spent nearly five hours more than G3 patients attending hospital visits. HBGM frequency was 3.6 per day in G3 at M6, not different from baseline or G1 and G2. After the study, 2/3 of patients in G2 and 3/4 in G3 wished to continue with Diabeo system. Conclusions: The Diabeo system gives a substantial improvement in metabolic control in chronic, poorly controlled T1D patients without requiring more medical time and at a lower overall cost for the patient than usual care. This system thus appears very attractive for adult patients with T1D whatever the age.

YR: 2016
AB: INTERVENTION: Intervention involves parental attendance at a brief, group‐based parenting program: Triple P Disobedience Discussion Group. A group‐based program is cost‐effective and can offer a favourable environment in which participants can build connections through interacting with others with shared experiences. The intervention itself will involve parental attendance at a single three‐hour discussion group focused on preventing and managing child misbehaviour, and encouraging positive behaviours. Parents may attend individually or with their partner, however data will be collected from a single caregiver only. The program draws on social learning theory and through utilizing the key principals of the Triple P System, encourages an interactive environment that facilitates open discussion between participants. Up to five groups (with identical content) will be held with approximately 10 participants in each. Two weeks following the intervention, a group‐based two‐hour consultation session will be offered to participants to assist with strategy implementation and discuss concerns and/or questions that may arise following the program. Parents will receive a workbook (that is theirs to keep), and a resource pack (including behaviour monitoring records and positive behaviour charts etc). During the intervention, parents will view powerpoint slides including short video segments. To ensure program fidelity it maintained, accredited program facilitators will follow a detailed presentation guide and will have the content of their sessions monitored using a program checklist. Participants in the intervention group will be known as the "Start Now" group. CONDITION: child emotional and behavioural problems parenting confidence parenting practices and behaviour psychological wellbeing sociocultural adaptation and acculturative stress PRIMARY OUTCOME: Parental Acculturative Stress total score as measured by the Riverside Acculturative Stress Inventory (Miller, Kim, & Benet‐Martinez, 2011). Parental Psychological Well‐being as measured by the DASS‐21 (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995): Total Depression, Anxiety, and Stress symptom scores. Parenting Confidence ‐ total score as measured by the CAPES Parent Efficacy Scale (Morawska et al., 2014). SECONDARY OUTCOME: Child adjustment indicated by the frequency of parent reported emotional and behavioural problems as measured by CAPES‐ Child Adjustment Scale (Morawska et al., 2104). Parental sociocultural adjustment as measured by the Sociocultural Adaptation Scale (Ward & Kennedy, 1999). Parenting behaviour and practices as measured by the The Parenting Scale (Arnold, O’Leary, Wolff, & Acker, 1993) and The Corporal Punishment Questionnaire (adapted from UNICEF Division of Policy and Planning, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey Manual, 2006). Program satisfaction: assessed using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (adapted) (Morawska & Sanders, 2010). INCLUSION CRITERIA: Participant inclusion criteria will specify that participants: (i) are a parent of a 2‐12 year old child, (ii) have lived in Australia no more than five years (iii) can read and understand basic English, and (iv) are over the age of 18 (the age of consent).

AB: BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a major public health problem. The It's LiFe! monitoring and feedback tool embedded in the Self‐Management Support Program (SSP) is an attempt to stimulate physical activity in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or type 2 diabetes treated in primary care. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to evaluate whether the SSP combined with the use of the monitoring and feedback tool leads to more physical activity compared to usual care and to evaluate the additional effect of using this tool on top of the SSP. METHODS: This was a three‐armed cluster randomised controlled trial. Twenty four family practices were randomly assigned to one of three groups in which participants received the tool + SSP (group 1), the SSP (group 2), or care as usual (group 3). The primary outcome measure was minutes of physical activity per day. The secondary outcomes were general and exercise self‐efficacy and quality of life. Outcomes were measured at baseline after the intervention (4‐6 months), and 3 months thereafter. RESULTS: The group that received the entire intervention (tool + SSP) showed more physical activity directly after the intervention than Group 3 (mean difference 11.73, 95% CI 6.21‐17.25; P<.001), and Group 2 (mean difference 7.86, 95% CI 2.18‐13.54; P=.003). Three months after the intervention, this effect was still present and significant (compared to Group 3: mean difference 10.59, 95% CI 4.94‐16.25; P<.001; compared to Group 2: mean difference 9.41, 95% CI 3.70‐15.11; P<.001). There was no significant difference in effect between Groups 2 and 3 on both time points. There was no interaction effect for disease type. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of counseling with the tool proved an effective way to stimulate physical activity. Counseling without the tool was not effective. Future research about the cost‐effectiveness and application under more tailored conditions and in other target groups is recommended.

AB: Introduction: Treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with adenosine by paramedics has been investigated and proven to be safe in the US and other countries, but patients ( pts) are admitted to hospital after treatment. We hypothesised that paramedics can safely treat and discharge pts with regular SVT without transfer to an accident and emergency department and tested this in a randomised controlled trial. Methods: Pts presenting with a regular narrow complex tachycardia on 12 lead ECG without contraindication for adenosine, hypotension, syncope, structural or ischaemic heart disease were considered for enrolment. Pts were randomised to paramedic treatment (PARA) or standard admission to hospital (A&E). PARA pts initially received valsalva manoeuvre at the scene with subsequent administration of 6 mg and 12 mg of adenosine unless the SVT termINated. Pts were taken to A&E if the tachycardia did not termINate, restarted, or the patient ( pt) had continuing symptoms, a persistently abnormal ECG (other than T wave inversion) or was heamodynamically unstable. Prior to discharge from the ambulance pts received a detailed information pack and a generic referral letter for their GP to refer them to an arrhythmia clinic. Pts randomised to A&E were treated as normal and given no information other than that pertaining to the study. Data was collected from the paramedics, A&E notes and a 6 month telephone interview. Results: Of the 48 pts (25 = F, age 50±18yrs) enrolled to date, 50% pts had previously attended A&E with palpitations. 1 pt was withdrawn as lost to follow up. (Table presented) PARA discharge times were relatively long because 9 pts randomised to paramedic treatment were transported to A&E (4 did not termINate arrhythmia, 1 abnormal observations, 4 paramedic felt ECG was abnormal (confirmed as minor abnormalities by expert panel that would not require treatment)). A panel of 2 arrhythmia experts confirmed that PARA treatment was appropriate in all pts but would have made further assessment of one pt taking fluticasone for COPD prior to adenosine administration. Conclusion: Paramedic treatment and discharge of pts with regular SVT is safe, efficacious and reduces admission to hospital. Cost effectiveness analysis is ongoing.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Specialist tinnitus services are in high demand as a result of the negative effect tinnitus may have on quality of life. Additional clinically and cost‐effective tinnitus management routes are needed. One potential route is providing Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for tinnitus via the Internet (iCBT). This study aimed to determine the efficacy of guided iCBT, using audiological support, on tinnitus distress and tinnitus‐related comorbidities, in the United Kingdom. A further aim was to establish the stability of intervention effects 2‐months postintervention. The hypothesis was that iCBT for tinnitus would be more effective at reducing tinnitus distress than weekly monitoring. DESIGN: A randomized, delayed intervention efficacy trial, with a 2‐month follow‐up was implemented to evaluate the efficacy of iCBT in the United Kingdom. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental (n = 73) or weekly monitoring control group (n = 73) after being stratified for tinnitus severity and age. After the experimental group completed the 8‐week long iCBT intervention, the control group undertook the same intervention. Intervention effects were, therefore, evaluated in two independent groups at two time points. The primary outcome was a change in tinnitus distress between the groups as assessed by the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary assessment measures were included for insomnia, anxiety, depression, hearing disability, hyperacusis, cognitive failures, and satisfaction with life. These were completed at baseline, postintervention, and at a 2‐month postintervention follow‐up. RESULTS: After undertaking the iCBT intervention, the experimental group had a greater reduction in tinnitus distress when compared with the control group. This reduction was statistically significant (Cohen's d = 0.7) and was clinically significant for 51% of the experimental group and 5% of the control group. This reduction was evident 4 weeks after commencing the iCBT intervention. Furthermore, the experimental group had a greater reduction in insomnia, depression, hyperacusis, cognitive failures, and a greater improvement in quality of life, as evidenced by the significant differences in these assessment measures postintervention. Results were maintained 2 months postintervention. CONCLUSIONS: Guided (using audiological support) iCBT for tinnitus resulted in statistically significant reductions in tinnitus distress and comorbidities (insomnia, depression, hyperacusis, cognitive failures) and a significant increase in quality of life. These effects remained stable at 2‐months postintervention. Further trials to determine the longer term efficacy of iCBT to investigate predictors of outcome and to compare iCBT with standard clinical care in the United Kingdom are required.Registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02370810 on 5/03/2015.

AB: In an RCT, we will compare 2 active treatments delivered over 12‐months via telehealth services linking participants in rural villages to Anchorage and Stanford‐based study counselors overcoming access‐to‐care for CV preventive health issues. The village AN health aides will facilitate data collection and telehealth connectivity. Intervention contacts occur at baseline, 3‐, 6‐ and 12‐months follow‐up, with the final assessment at 18‐months. The repeated intervention contacts provide iterative computerized feedback reflecting prior responses and encouragement of adoption and maintenance of behavioral health goals. The groups are: 1. Tobacco/Physical Activity Intervention (n=150), consisting of a psychosocial component that includes counselor‐facing computer‐assisted intervention with tailored counseling feedback focused on increasing intrinsic motivation, goal setting for tobacco and physical activity, adherence with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT, patch plus gum or lozenge), and self‐monitoring with a pedometer‐based walking program. The study will provide 12‐weeks of NRT for participants randomized to this intervention condition. 2. HTN/HCL (HTN/HC, n=150), consisting of a psychosocial component that includes counselor‐facing computer‐assisted intervention with tailored counseling feedback focused on increasing intrinsic motivation, goal setting for managing HTN and HCL, and adherence with antihypertensives and statins with supportive dietary changes. The AN health plan covers antihypertensive and statins as a benefit to patients and would be prescribed as part of standard of care (i.e., not prescribed for the purposes of this research); however, strategies to maximize medication adherence are needed, hence the focus of this intervention. The counseling and print materials are highly individualized, unique to the participant, thereby minimizing the likelihood of cross‐condition contamination, determined to be minimal in prior investigations. For the research study, participant eligibility criteria include AN heritage; daily cigarette smoking; and hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or established vascular disease. Intention to change the targeted risk behaviors will not be required to participate. Utilizing telemedicine technology and Transtheoretical Model‐tailored interventions, the trial aims to reach at‐risk AN people regardless of residential location or current motivation. The primary outcome is biochemically‐confirmed tobacco abstinence using anabasine. Secondary outcomes include moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity assessed by self‐report, blood pressure, cholesterol ratio, medication adherence, dietary change, body mass index, Framingham index, multibehavioral impact factor, a linear index, and cost effectiveness.

AB: BACKGROUND: The provision of patient information leaflets regarding telehealth has been perceived by potential consumers as a strategy to promote awareness and adoption of telehealth services. However, such leaflets need to be designed carefully if adoption and awareness among potential users is to be promoted. Therefore, the aims of this study were: first, to see how telehealth was portrayed in some of the existing telehealth leaflets (THLs). Second, to explore patients' perceptions of the existing THLs and their engagement with the concept and how THLs can be optimised. METHODS: A two‐step approach was employed to address the aims of this study. The first phase involved the use of discourse analysis to compare 12 electronically and publically available THLs, with the existing THL guidance "Involve Yorkshire and Humber". The second phase involved conducting 14 semi‐structured interviews with potential telehealth users/patients to gauge their perception and engagement with the concept, using the two leaflets that were mostly matching with the guidance used. Six interviews were audio‐recorded and eight had detailed jotted notes. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed to identify key themes. RESULTS: The discourse analysis showed certain gaps and variations within the screened leaflets when addressing the following aspects: cost of the telehealth service, confidentiality, patients' choices in addition to equipment use and technical support. Analysis of the interviews revealed patients' need for having clear and sufficient information about the telehealth service within the THLs; in addition to, patients' preference for the use of simpler terminologies for telehealth description and the provision of clear simple texts with pictorial presentations. The interviews also revealed certain limitations against adoption of telehealth by the participants, such as: lack of privacy and confidentiality of information, fear of technology breakdown and equipment failure, loss of face‐to‐face contact with healthcare professionals and being too dependent on the telehealth service. CONCLUSION: The current study showed a great variation among the screened THLs and highlighted certain gaps within the content and presentation of these leaflets. However, the study also highlighted certain key issues to be considered when designing THLs in the future to enhance telehealth uptake and use by patients.

AB: Background: The decision to admit a patient from the ED is complex and multifactorial. Avoiding low value admissions requires safe and cost‐effective outpatient care options as well as ED processes to access alternatives to hospital care. We assessed the resources available to emergency providers when making hospital admission decisions with the goal of identifying potential interventions for quality improvement. Methods: A cross‐sectional web‐based survey was sent via email to medical directors and/or nurse managers of the 135 hospital‐based EDs in Michigan. Questions included: (1) identifying groups that influence the decision to admit; (2) availability of standardized programs or services in the ED, hospital or community to reduce avoidable admissions; and (3) barriers to connecting patients with outpatient services that could obviate the need for admission. ED characteristics and perceptions regarding admission rates were also collected. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Results: Of the 131 EDs reached, 64 (49%) responded. EDs were geographically distributed throughout the state, ranging in size from 3 to 111 beds (mean 26.6) with 1,800 to 127,000 visits (mean 39,725) annually. Three‐quarters of respondents thought their hospital's administration viewed their ED admission rate as appropriate. Forty percent of respondents reported primary care physicians (PCPs) were always or frequently involved in their admission decisions and 45% always or frequently involved specialists. Fewer reported involvement by utilization review (33%), social work (26%), and case managers (20%). The most common programs and services designed to reduce avoidable admissions were home health care (64%), observation units (62%), and wound care services (55%). The least common were telemedicine programs (7%), rapid specialist follow‐up (4%), and ED follow‐up clinic (4%). Preferences for admission from patient/family (55%), specialists (53%) and PCPs (36%) were commonly perceived barriers to connecting patients with outpatient service to avoid admission. Conclusion: Within a geographically diverse set of EDs in Michigan, there are few services supporting emergency providers connecting patients with outpatient care options as alternatives to hospitalization. Awareness and additional resources are likely integral to reducing avoidable admissions.

AB: Introduction: In the present treatment paradigm, the yearly national expense for diabetes care is $340 billion while less the 14% of people with Diabetes achieve all targets together. The Virtual Pancreas System (VPS) has proven its quality, by reaching Targets in >% 90. It makes treatment effective, corrects strategic dosing of insulin and oral medications, and cut cost to achieve the triple aim of optimum HgA1 c/glucose variability, averting hypoglycemia or weight gain. Hypothesis and design: if the VPS has better quality and value than other alternative do we need to change our paradigm and how much can we save yearly? This tool is now cloud based, reachable by any mobile phone or internet as a Virtual Pancreas System with embedded metabolic simulator. We compared the value index by finding how much money ($) is spent on improving HgA1c by %1 in three months for standard intensive care (SIC) Vs Virtual Pancreas System (VPS) care, and projected the savings on total diabetes care per year for the 30 million people with diabetes. Results: 1) VPS lowered HgA1c by absolute value of 2.3% and relative value of %2.7 when compared to standard care , which is better than many newer medications percent(DPP4: 0.5, SLGT2: 0.8‐1, Liraglutide 0.8‐1, Dulaglutide: 1.08). 2) The diabetes care value index was: $106 per %1 HgA1C drop for VPS, $580 for DDP4, $400 for SGLT2, $770 for Liraglutide, $640 for Dulaglutide,. 3) Average yearly savings was a minimum of $3000, and projection for the 30 million $90 billion. Interpretation: VPS will save more than $90 billion while improving quality. We need the savings because "The status quo is unsustainable from both a population health standpoint and an economic one. Conclusion: Virtual Pancreas System is a superior paradigm. It will save $90 billion per year compared to Standard present paradigm. Here is how I envision the new brave world of diabetes care in the future: 1) each patient is registered through their PCP office, their medical home, to the cloud based VPS with their secure user name and password. 2) Patients and providers receive instant feedback to act. 3) endocrinologists/diabetologists are supervise the process to interfere only for consultation and advice when necessary. 4) The goal of optimum diabetes care is reached with optimal HgA1C, optimal weight, and no hypoglycemia at 14 glucose tests per month. 5) This new paradigm will cut burden of the diabetic epidemic scourge by 90 Billions/year, we could prove it by initiating real life large multi‐center studies. This should be the new paradigm on this world health day: promising and achievable.

AB: BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition affecting nearly 5.7 million Americans and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. With an aging population, the cost associated with managing HF is expected to more than double from US $31 billion in 2012 to US $70 billion by 2030. Readmission rates for HF patients are high‐25% are readmitted at 30 days and nearly 50% at 6 months. Low medication adherence contributes to poor HF management and higher readmission rates. Remote telehealth monitoring programs aimed at improved medication management and adherence may improve HF management and reduce readmissions. OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this randomized controlled pilot study is to compare the MedSentry remote medication monitoring system versus usual care in older HF adult patients who recently completed a HF telemonitoring program. We hypothesized that remote medication monitoring would be associated with fewer unplanned hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, increased medication adherence, and improved health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to usual care. METHODS: Participants were randomized to usual care or use of the remote medication monitoring system for 90 days. Twenty‐nine participants were enrolled and the final analytic sample consisted of 25 participants. Participants completed questionnaires at enrollment and closeout to gather data on medication adherence, health status, and HRQoL. Electronic medical records were reviewed for data on baseline classification of heart function and the number of unplanned hospitalizations and ED visits during the study period. RESULTS: Use of the medication monitoring system was associated with an 80% reduction in the risk of all‐cause hospitalization and a significant decrease in the number of all‐cause hospitalization length of stay in the intervention arm compared to usual care. Objective device data indicated high adherence rates (95%‐99%) among intervention group participants despite finding no significant difference in self‐reported adherence between study arms. The intervention group had poorer heart function and HRQoL at baseline, and HRQoL declined significantly in the intervention group compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The MedSentry medication monitoring system is a promising technology that merits continued development and evaluation. The MedSentry medication monitoring system may be useful both as a standalone system for patients with complex medication regimens or used to complement existing HF telemonitoring interventions. We found significant reductions in risk of all‐cause hospitalization and the number of all‐cause length of stay in the intervention group compared to controls. Although HRQoL deteriorated significantly in the intervention group, this may have been due to the poorer HF‐functioning at baseline in the intervention group compared to controls. Telehealth medication adherence technologies, such as the MedSentry medication monitoring system, are a promising method to improve patient self‐management,the quality of patient care, and reduce health care utilization and expenditure for patients with HF and other chronic diseases that require complex medication regimens.

TI: Preconditioning Against Renal Damage Under Contrast Examination
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct02054858
YR: 2014
KY: Acute Kidney Injury
AB: Intravenous contrast for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions is a leading cause of hospital‐acquired acute renal failure (1). Contrast‐induced acute kidney injury (CI‐AKI) occurs through a complex mechanism including toxic and hypoxic renal tubular injury, diminished renal parenchymal circulation and renal endothelial dysfunction with the production of oxygen free radicals due to post‐ischaemia oxidative stress (2). With increasing numbers of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the incidence of CI‐AKI will rise over the next few decades. Already, 40% of general surgical in‐patients undergo cross‐sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT), largely using contrast (3). Optimal clinical care in many specialties such as oncology, emergency medicine and surgery relies upon information derived from contrast‐enhanced cross‐sectional imaging. In consequence, large numbers of patients are exposed to the risk of CI‐AKI. Current CI‐AKI preventive measures comprise identification of at‐risk patients, minimisation of contrast dose and the use of intravenous volume expansion (4). Simple, cost‐effective methods to reduce CI‐AKI are required. Risk factors for CI‐AKI include advanced age, diabetes mellitus, pre‐existing renal insufficiency and congestive cardiac failure. Dehydration also increases the risk (5). While patients over the age of 65 years currently account for 11% of the Irish population, they account for 30% of surgical admissions (6). In a recent cohort study of 1800 surgical in‐patients in a major Irish teaching hospital, acute renal failure was a common major complication, occurring in 2.4% of patients (6). Multivariate analysis of this cohort demonstrated that increasing age and emergency admission were both independent risk factors for complications (6). Emergency surgical patients constitute a high‐risk group in whom simple methods to minimise complications are required. Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a simple technique whereby brief periods of skeletal muscle ischaemia and reperfusion triggers a period of resistance to ischaemia‐reperfusion injury in distant tissues e.g. heart or kidney (7). It reduces renal damage following endovascular aneurysm repair, a procedure requiring considerable contrast‐volumes (8). A recent meta‐analysis demonstrated that RIPC significantly reduced post‐procedure creatinine levels following cardiovascular procedures, though there was considerable clinical heterogeneity between the included trials (9). We hypothesise that RIPC induced using brief periods of upper limb ischaemia‐reperfusion will reduce AKI in patients undergoing contrast enhanced CT scans. The hypothesis that RIPC will reduce CI‐AKI was first explored by Whittaker and Pryzklenk (10). They utilised available data from a patient cohort undergoing emergency coronary angioplasty. Patients with 1 to 3 balloon inflations in the coronary artery served as the control group whilst those with >3 balloon inflations served as the RIPC group.Both groups displayed an immediate improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). However, the control group then displayed a statistically significant decrease in eGFR by day 3 post‐procedure (77 +14 ml/min/1.73m2 versus 70 +12 ml/min/1.73m2). The RIPC group displayed no such difference by day 3 (81 +21 ml/min/1.73m2 versus 80 +14 ml/min/1.73m2) despite having received a larger contrast volume. This observation implied a potential protective effect for RIPC. Greater availability of CT technology has led to a dramatic increase in the number of patients undergoing ce‐CTAP in recent years. Between 1996 and 2010, the number of patients undergoing CT scans in the United States tripled, increasing by 8% per annum (11). Simultaneously, an increasingly elderly and sick population means that many patients now have multiple co‐morbidities, increasing their risk of contrast‐induced acute kidney injury. Approximately 6.5% of patients undergoing ce‐CT develop acute kidney injury defined as a >25% increase in serum creatinine from baseline (12). Simple methods to reduce CI‐AKI are required. We propose that the use of remote ischaemic preconditioning could be a simple, cost‐effective measure that could decrease the incidence of CI‐AKI in high risk patients undergoing contrast enhanced CT scans.

AB: According to Mental Health America, 1 in 5 adults have a mental health condition. Mental health is associated with higher incidence of chronic diseases, lower use of medical care, and one of five most costly conditions in the US in 2006 according to the American Psychological Association. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has called for residents to develop an understanding of social‐behavioral sciences as a basis for patient care. ACGME advises that the curriculum is extended to physical aspects of patient care as well as the emotional, social and behavioral aspects. The Society of Teachers of Family Medicine (STFM) has also suggested the importance of the psychosocial realm. According to both the ACGME and STFM, being able to glean the necessary information is an integral part of being a family doctor. The need for healthcare providers, medical students, and residents to possess basic interviewing, counseling and agenda setting skills to ascertain the pertinent contextual (e.g., familial, social, cultural, spiritual, etc.), health behavior, and health risk factors of patients' lives, is vital to close the gap on behavioral health and chronic diseases. In order to evaluate learners' interviewing skills, the Contextual Interview Observation Form (CIOF) an observation tool was developed using Robinson, Gould, and Strosahl's (2010) interview format. The CIOF can be used to teach a contextual interview "procedure" that is organized in a logical manner with a practical format. This "contextual interview" provides a no‐cost format for the learner to capture the context of patients' behaviorally influenced health concerns and is applicable during the 4‐year curriculum as well as during the clerkship years. Many Americans lack access to health care, with an even greater shortage of access to mental health providers, especially in rural and underserved areas. Improving access to behavioral health providers and recognition of mental illness via telemedicine, could lead to improved patient outcomes and cost. However, in the pedagogical course of medical education, the investigators do not provide a robust platform for teaching telemedicine. Implementing the CIOF in a telesimulation format will allow for healthcare providers, behavior health providers, medical students, and residents to practice and experience providing basic interviewing and counseling via telemedicine. According to McCoy et al, telesimulation is "a process by which telecommunication and simulation resources are utilized to provide education, training, and/or assessment to learners at an off‐site location. Off‐site location refers to a distant site that would preclude the education, training, and/or assessment without the use of telecommunication resources." Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences educates and trains healthcare professionals emphasizing service among rural and medically underserved communities throughout the Northwest. Specifically, the investigators cover rural and underserved areas in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Montana, and Idaho. PNWU's envisioned Institute for Interprofessional Practice & Education (IIPE) focuses on cultivating healthcare teams from a variety of professional backgrounds to enhance person‐centered health care. One goal of PNWU's strategic plan is to expand graduate level educational opportunities. In response to that goal, the Yakima Valley Interprofessional Practice and Education Collaborative (YVIPEC) was established in the fall of 2014 to promote the highest quality health care in the region through a culture of inclusive and collaborative interprofessional education, practice, and scholarship. Interprofessional education (IPE) fosters a team‐based approach to health care which is the approach used in rural health clinics and is reported to be critical to success in working in medically underserved areas. These collaborations include: ‐ Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences (PNWU), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine; ‐ Heritage University (HU), Physician Assistant Program and Nursing Program; ‐ Washington State University (WSU), Nursing Program and Pharmacy Program; ‐ Central Washington University (CWU), Paramedicine Program and Dietetics Program; ‐ Washington State Allied Health Center of Excellence, located at Yakima Valley College The current PNWU College of Osteopathic Medicine (COM) curriculum includes CLIN 618, which is a second year requirement and presents a multidimensional approach to the understanding of the most common clinical entities in psychiatry and behavioral medicine. Third and fourth year courses includes BEHCS 701 Behavioral Medicine rotation which is designed for students to learn and practice skills necessary for working with patients in a mental health setting. Incorporating the COIF via telesimulation would give students, residents, and faculty the experience for use beyond course requirements and prepare them for the future of healthcare.

TI: Evaluation of the Philips Lifeline CareSage Risk Assessment System
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03126565
YR: 2017
AB: The growing elderly population and rising rates of costly chronic disease have led to the development of preventative homecare management opportunities to improve health outcomes and reduce the number of patients who enter costly inpatient care. Partners HealthCare at Home (PHH) is a preventative homecare management system which offers general care as well as specialized services to help patients and their loved ones manage chronic conditions at home. Such continuity of care is achieved through a multidisciplinary clinical team and the integration of telemonitoring into the patient's care plan. The Philips Lifeline Personal Emergency Response Service (PERS), a wearable button device worn on the wrist or as a pendant, is a telemonitoring device available to patients receiving care through PHH. When the patient presses the button, the patient is immediately connected with a Lifeline response agent. Philips Lifeline (PLL) has developed CareSage, a predictive analytics engine that combines continuous monitoring with predictive analytics. The clinical interface (CareSage platform) helps care teams monitor the patient's calculated risk scores for emergency transport. The algorithm used by this integrated risk assessment system was originally developed after studying a large cohort of the PERS subscribers (N = ~600,000). In Phase 1 of this study the algorithm was validated among a cohort (N = 3,335) of PHH patients to predict emergency transports in this population (AUC = .76). In Phase 2 of this study, the investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized trial of 370 patients to assess the effect of the risk assessment CareSage platform and PHH tailored interventions on the rate of readmissions, quality of life, and the overall cost of medical care. The investigators hypothesize that a multidisciplinary intervention approach could significantly reduce the healthcare resource utilization in patient at high risk for hospitalization. The intervention will flag those patients at the highest risk for hospital transport, alert the patient's care team that an intervention may be needed, thereby targeting care at high risk patients who are most likely to get readmitted. By predicting which patients are at high risk of hospital transport which may lead to hospitalization, targeting interventions at those patients and engaging patients with their care team, the investigators hope to reduce readmissions, hospital days, and rates of mortality in high risk patients. The goal of this 2‐arm randomized controlled study is to assess the impact of the CareSage risk assessment platform on 90‐ and 180‐day Emergency Department (ED) visits in a cohort of PHH patients. All patients will receive the PERS device and be followed for a total of 9 months, including an initial 3‐month observation period and followed by a 6‐month intervention period. At the beginning of the observation period (baseline), enrolled patients will be randomized into 2 groups: the Intervention Group or the Control Group. During the observation period the CareSage algorithm will calibrate using patient data (both groups) collected during this interval from the PERS device. Then, during the intervention period, patients in the intervention group will be actively monitored by the CareSage algorithm and will receive tailored PHH interventions if flagged as being at high risk for emergency transport. Patients in the control group will receive care as usual during the intervention period. All data collected during the study will be used to further strengthen the CareSage algorithm developed in the Phase I of this study.

TI: Comparing Clinical Application of Innovatedly Made Transpalatal Arch (TPA) From 3D Reconstructed Model and Conventionally Made TPA
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03755622
YR: 2018
AB: INTRODUCTION Transpalatal Arch (TPA) has been invented by Dr. Robert Ara Goshgarian, a renowned orthodontist more than 7 decades ago. Throughout the years, various modifications of the design were made for different purposes and to increase its efficacy in achieving the optimum level of anchorage. In 1947, fabrication of Nance Palatal Ach (NPA) pioneered the adjustment of TPA by incorporation of an acrylic button that connects the palatal wire at the highest part of palatal vault. Recent innovations mostly involved adhesions of TPA to mini implants or temporary anchorage devices (TAD) and proven to be time and cost effective to be used in orthodontics. The usage of TPA for space maintenance demonstrated to be more advantagous in term of soft tissue compatibilty and increase in vertical control compared to Nance appliance. The combination of TPA and extraction of deciduos maxillary canines in the late mix dentition has shown to be an acceptable interceptive treatment to prevent maxillary canines palatal impaction. Despite numerous changes and alterations, the versatility of usage has made TPA remained as a useful adjunct in clinical orthodontics until today. However the fabrication of TPA required meticulous clinical steps which started with insertion of elastomeric separators on mesial and distal interproximal surfaces of maxillary permanent first molar teeth. One week later, separators were removed and series of molar bands selection or 'try in' session were carried out to get the correct size that fits the molar teeth. The drawbacks of this action is that, the 'used' molar bands if not properly decontaminated with an enzymatic cleaning and properly sterilized using autoclave, it may constitute a cross‐infection hazard. An impression with molar bands in situ were taken and sent to the dental lab for fabrication of TPA followed by re‐insertion of separators between the molar teeth. This means that each patient has to bear the discomfort caused by elastomeric separators for at least two weeks time or more. Orthodontists have to spent time for molar bands selection and dental technicians have more workload from pouring of impression until finishing of TPA. RATIONALE Patients do not have to undergo twice elastomeric separators placement as reported that among 4 orthodontic treatment procedures carried out,(upper alginate impression, separator placement, band placement and adjustment of arch wire), placement of separator causes a significant bacteraemia. Clinicians could cut down the number of appointments and time could be utilized to see more other cases. Currently there are 7 dental technicians in Paediatric and Orthodontic Department to cater for 10 Orthodontists, 6 Senior Postgraduates and 5 Junior Postgraduates, 1 technician was assigned for Optech management at Balai Ungku Aziz and starting from 2018, all technician will be involved in dental chair maintenance for the whole UM. Heavy workload and other commitments resulted in lack of time to finish all orthodontic cases. AIM To investigate whether TPA fabricated from 3D reconstructed model are feasible for clinical application. OBJECTIVES 1. To compare the oral health related quality of life of patients before wearing TPA and after 3 months of appliance wear. 2. To compare the oral health related quality of life of patients wearing TPA fabricated from 3D reconstructed model and conventionally produced TPA up to 3 months. 3. To compare pain levels of patients wearing TPA fabricated from 3D reconstructed model and conventionally produced TPA up to 3 months. 4. To determine clinicians' preferences between TPA made from 3D reconstructed model and TPA produced from plaster dental cast. PRIMARY OUTCOME ‐Oral health related quality of life. SECONDARY OUTCOME ‐ Pain levels. ‐ Clinicians preferences. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Ethical Consideration: ‐ Ethical approval gained from Medical Ethics Committee, (DF CD1607/0057(P) Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya from 11th July 2016 ‐ 31st May 2019 ‐ Grant approved : PPPC/C1‐2016/DGD/12 RM 17,085.00 Sample Size Calculation: ‐ Sample size estimation is based on comparative literature by (Johal et al., 2014) and calculated using G Power 3.1.92 software under supervision of statistician. ‐ Therefore, it was estimated that a sample size of 46 subjects was needed to demonstrate a significant change in OHRQoL, with an 80 per cent probability power at the 5% level of significance. ‐ The sample size was inflated by a 10% margin to allow for loss to follow‐up and drop outs; thus, the total sample size was a minimum of 52. MATERIAL AND METHODS 52 patients undergoing orthodontic treatment at Orthodontic Clinic, University of Malaya, required Transpalatal Arch (TPA) and fulfilled the inclusion criterias will be be randomly selected for this single‐blinded study.They will be divided into two groups (n =26 for each group) , Group C will received conventional TPA while Group 3D will be given TPA fabricated on three‐dimensionally (3D) reconstructed model. 6 orthodontic postgraduates will be involved in providing treatment for these patients. 4 operators will be having 9 patients each while the other 2 operators will have 8 patients each. 4 operators will be provided with an opaque envelope comprises of 9 lots each and 2 operators will have 8 lots each. Dental Surgery Assistant (DSA) assisting each operator will open the opaque envelope that have been allocated for each sample after the written consent is signed.Baseline questionnare (T0) will be distributed at this stage, prior to fabrication of TPA. Group C will undergo normal clinical and laboratory procedure of conventional TPA. For Group 3D, the dental casts will be sent to Centre For Biomedical And Technology Integration (CBMTI) for digitization using the Geomagic Capture three‐dimensional scanner carried out by 2 trained Design Engineer.Captured images are automatically processed by the Geomagic Design X software and virtually remodelled by the same personnel. Total resection of upper right and left second premolars (15, 25) and upper right and left second molars (17, 27) were simulated prior to printing for easier molar band insertion and cost reduction. Modified 3D dental model were printed out using Acrylonitrile‐Butadine‐Styrene (ABS) material through Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technique . TPA will be constructed on it by the same technician who fabricated the conventional version. First modified OHIP 14, (T1) will be distributed 1 week post cementation of TPA, followed by T2 at 1 month post insertion and T3 at 3 months post cementation. Patients will be dismissed from the study after the T3 stage. SELECTION CRITERIA Patients requiring TPA in conjunction with upper and lower FA CONSENT All patients were given oral and written information concerning the study and signed a written consent INCLUSION CRITERIA ‐ Age 18 and above ‐ Requiring premolar extractions ‐ Patients do not have previous orthodontic treatment before EXCLUSION CRITERIA ‐ Patient requiring lingual arch, modified TPA, Nance Palatal Arc ‐ Non extraction upper arch treatment ‐ Patients requiring upper arch expansion ‐ Requiring upper first permanent molar extraction ‐ Presence of dento‐facial anomalies. ‐ Patients requiring orthognathic surgery MEASURING METHODS AND DATA COLLECTION Acquisition of digital model: ‐Conventional study model will be scanned using structured light scanner (Geomagic Capture) to produce 3D digital model. Virtual remodelling : ‐Simulated cutting of upper second premolar and upper second molar teeth via Geomagic Design X (XOR) software prior to printing to reduce the cost. Printing of 3D reconstructed model : A 3D "UP Plus 2" printer will print out the remodeled version with Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) material. Construction of TPA : All TPAs will be constructed by the same technician, using the same type of Molar Bands (3M Unitek), 0.9 stainless steel wire and similar type of cementation that is 3M Unitek Multi‐Cure Glass Ionomer Orthodontic Band Cement. Randomization https://www.randomizer.org/ Measuring tools ‐ OHIP Questionnaires adapted from: Oral Health Impact Profile Malaysian version (S‐OHIP[M]). ‐ The respondents are asked to answer on a five‐point frequency Likert scale (very often, quite often, sometimes, once a while, and never). ‐ Progress record of each device to operators. ‐ Focus group discussion (FGD) among 5 operators. Statistical Analysis ‐ Statistical Package for Social sciences (SPSS version 22.0.0.0) ‐ Analysis : Paired t‐test, Repeated measure ANOVA ‐ Qualitative analysis : NVivo OHIP ‐ Oral Health Impact Profile Malaysian version (L‐OHIP[M]) with 45 items is an adaptation of the original version developed by Slade and Spencer (1994), 49 items ‐ Short version (S‐OHIP[M]) was also developed, which contains only 14 items ‐Seven domains namely:‐ 1. Functional limitation 2. Physical pain 3. Psychological discomfort 4. Physical disability 5. Psychological disability 6. Social disability 7. Handicap Although the S‐OHIP(M)was developed to be used as a descriptive and discriminative measure in population oral health surveys, it may also be appropriate for use in clinical trials and in clinical practice as an evaluative measure. FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION ‐ Focus group interview is a "carefully planned discussion designed to obtain perceptions in a defined area of interest in a permissive, nonthreatening environment" (Krueger, 1988). ‐ Intended to promote self disclosure among participants. ‐ Most likely to happen when the participants perceive that they are alike in some important way and when the environment is non judgmental. ‐ 6 ‐ 10 participants, 1 moderator. ‐ Conversation taped, recorded. ‐ 60 ‐ 90 minutes. ‐ Until saturation point reached (saturation is the point at which no new information emerges). ‐ Transcribe into several themes. ‐ Analyze by NVivo software.

AB: Background: The advent of new‐generation, highly effective direct‐acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has presented an ambitious but achievable opportunity to eliminate the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a major public health issue by 2030. These remarkably effective treatments, combined with a negligible side‐effect profile, have now enabled management of most patients in a primary care setting. The achievement of the lofty elimination goal demands development of new models of care. This includes engagement of general practitioners with specialist support, while maintaining a patient‐centered approach. The primary vehicle for assisting with a GP model of care is currently via nurse‐led community programs or use of the remote consultation form in conjunction with specialists. Small studies before the DAA era suggest equivalent sustained virological response (SVR) rates with community HCV therapy via telehealth models; however, loss to follow‐up may be higher than in tertiary settings. Digital health technologies represent a new opportunity to facilitate timely, coordinated, participatory medicine, and potentially address many of the roadblocks preventing GP initiation of HCV treatment, while ensuring adequate specialist supervision and follow‐up if required. Methods: HealthElink is a custom‐made, web‐based portal intended to promote patient‐centered chronic disease management. Patient‐, nurse‐, GP‐, and specialist‐specific interfaces allow development and delivery of custom treatment plans, direct messaging capabilities between each party, electronic reminders, progress indicators, and streamlined task management for tertiary teams. The HCV‐specific module has an inbuilt algorithm which enables the GP to generate an appropriate treatment regimen, based on Australian Liver Association consensus guidelines, by entering specific viral and host biochemical characteristics. Other features include automated calculation of surrogate markers of fibrosis and incorporation and real‐time integration with the University of Liverpool hepatitis drug interaction checker. A prospective, multicenter pilot of HealthElink across primary care services in South Australia, Victoria, and the Northern Territory, as well as prison services in South Australia and the Northern Territory, is scheduled to begin in June 2017. The primary outcome is SVR at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include patient, doctor and nurse satisfaction; cost analysis; and number of treatment initiations per practitioner. Additional data regarding time spent on the portal by each person and usage statistics will be gathered. We anticipate preliminary results to be presented in mid 2018, followed by a qualitative analysis at the completion of the study to further elicit the clinician and patient experience of using the portal. A usability study is currently underway comparing HealthElink with the current standard of care using the GESA remote consultation form via task‐based observation. This includes qualitative analysis of the user experience and measurement of time taken to complete a specialist referral via HealthElink compared with current practice (the remote consultation form). Final pre‐launch testing of HealthElink is concurrently underway, involving the prison service in South Australia using de‐identified data. Results: Seven patients have been successfully recruited via prison medical officers through the HealthElink portal as part of pre‐launch final testing. The HealthELink HCV treatment algorithm provided appropriate treatment options to prison medical officers for all seven patients (based on viral and host characteristics). One patient was excluded from remote treatment initiation and referred for further investigation via the portal based on a low platelet count, despite an aspartate aminotransferase to platelet index of less than 1.0. Recruitment for the formal pilot study is expected to commence in June 2017. We anticipate preliminary results to be presented in mid 2018.

YR: 2017
AB: INTERVENTION: At their single clinic visit, participants are asked to provide initial samples for analysis of BV and will then will be randomised to receive either: 1. Intravaginal lactic acid gel used once daily for 7 days (Intervention) 2. Oral metronidazole tablets, 400mg twice daily for 7 days (control) Participants are randomised using a remote internet based randomisation system that is developed and maintained by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit (NCTU). Oral metronidazole is currently recommended as first line therapy in the UK national BV treatment guidelines and will be used within its licensed indication. Intravaginal lactic acid gel is a CE‐marked medical device, which will be used within its intended purpose. Therefore, the study is classed as a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product (CTIMP), where oral metronidazole is considered investigational medicinal product (IMP) for the purposes of the trial. Following the initial visit, participants will then be followed up for resolution of their symptoms 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months later via participant completed web‐based questionnaires and self‐sampling kits, completed at home. CONDITION: Specialty: Infectious diseases and microbiology, Primary sub‐specialty: Clinical infectious diseases; UKCRC code/ Disease: Infection/ Bacterial, viral and other infectious agents ; Urological and Genital Diseases ; Bacterial vaginosis (BV) PRIMARY OUTCOME: Resolution of bacterial vaginosis based on participant reported resolution of symptoms at week 2 (14 days from randomisation). SECONDARY OUTCOME: 1. Time to first recurrence of BV is measured using patient reported questionnaires over 6 months; 2. Number of participant reported BV episodes is measured using patient reported questionnaires over 6 months; 3. Number of participant reported BV treatment courses is measured using patient reported questionnaires over 6 months; 4. Microbiological resolution of BV is measured using microscopy of vaginal smears at week 2; 5. Comparative tolerability of lactic acid gel and metronidazole assessed by participant reporting of side effects (including nausea, vomiting, taste disturbance, vaginal irritation, diarrhoea and abdominal pain) using patient reported questionnaire at 2 weeks and via participant interviews post intervention; 6. Participant reported adherence to treatment is measured using participants reports at 2 weeks; 7. Acceptability of treatments via qualitative assessment in a subgroup of participants post intervention; 8.

AB: Background Delays in site set‐up are a common problem in multi‐centre randomised controlled trials. The frequency and format of contact with potential sites could play a role in reducing delays. Preliminary contact, prior to sites submitting for R&D approval, may involve liaising with healthcare professionals at the site to discuss the trial rationale and design, responding to queries, finalising local arrangements, and obtaining agreement to participate in the study. Such contact can be conducted as face‐to‐face, on‐site meetings, or remotely via email, web or telephone correspondence. We sought to compare the effectiveness of remote versus face‐to‐face initiation, followed by a final on‐site set‐up meeting, on recruitment to the SWIFFT trial, and to inform the feasibility of undertaking such a comparison across other trials. Methods This cluster randomised, feasibility trial was a study within a trial (SWAT) embedded within the SWIFFT surgical trial. The primary outcome was the number of patients recruited per site. Secondary outcomes included: time to (i) submission of R&D application, (ii) receipt of R&D approval, (iii) final on‐site set‐up meeting prior to starting recruitment, and (iv) first randomised participant; number of patients screened; the proportion of hospital forms and participant questionnaires returned; and the time to return these forms. No formal power calculation was conducted, as the sample size was restricted by the number of sites approach to take part in the host trial. All sites were randomised (except the site of the Chief Investigator), and blinded to their involvement. Allocation was 1:1 via minimisation balancing on (i) whether the Principal Investigator had previous experience of working on a multi‐centre surgical RCT, (ii) whether the site had a research nurse in place, and (iii) the size of catchment area (< vs > 500,000). The main analyses used intention to treat. Site‐level, time to event outcomes were compared between the trial arms using Cox proportional hazards regression, and recruitment outcomes were analysed via Mann‐Whitney U tests. Return of questionnaires and time to return were analysed at the participant‐level using logistic and Cox regression as appropriate accounting for clustering by site using robust standard errors (logistic) or a shared frailty (Cox). Results Thirty‐seven sites were included (20 face‐to‐face and 17 remote), of which 33 (89%) opened to recruitment. The median number of participants recruited from sites allocated to receive on‐site initiation was higher than from those allocated to remote initiation (10 (interquartile range 1.5‐17) vs 6 (5‐23)), though this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.79). No statistically significant differences were observed in any of the secondary outcomes. There were four crossovers: 3 on‐site to remote, and 1 remote to on‐site. Conclusion In this feasibility trial, we found no evidence that face‐to‐face preliminary initiation of sites recruited to take part in a multi‐centre RCT is more effective than remote contact on reducing set‐up time, or improving recruitment or data collection. The cost of the two approaches will be explored.

AB: INTERVENTION: Patients will be randomised into two groups, to either receive standard care or to receive six months telehealth support (doc@HOME), which is an integrated solution for the remote health management of patients with long term conditions and consists of a robust, handheld data collection unit which connects through a standard telephone line at the patient's home to a secure server. doc@HOME is designed to ensure that care follows the patient providing access from anywhere at anytime. Patients will be able to: 1. Complete a system integrated patient tailored questionnaire regarding respiratory status and upload daily 2. Automated daily uploading of physiological measurements obtained from a pulse oximeter and digital thermometer 3. Receive feedback through the system in the form of text/email‐like messages between the patient and clinician in response to uploads that can either be automated or targeted according to the review of information received All patients will be required to fill in a series of questionnaires (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiey and Depression Score questionnaire and the ED‐5Q questionnaire) to assess health status and quality of life at five timepoints: baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 7 months and 12 months. Together, these take about 30 minutes to complete. These will be delivered in face‐to‐face interviews by a member of the Chronic Disease Management Team. The first six months of the study will be the active intervention in which half of the sample will receive the telehealth support, after which there will be six months of passive intervention in order to assess changes in general health status and quality of life.

AB: Background and aims: Widening screening criteria, lowering diagnostic thresholds and underlying demographic changes threaten to overwhelm resource‐ limited services for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We have developed a mobile phone‐based telehealth system (GDm‐Health) with the aims of supporting treatment of GDM, reducing clinic visits, improving response time to abnormal BG readings and increasing women's satisfaction with the care they receive. This pilot study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of the GDm‐Health system in clinical practice, to assess blood glucose (BG) control and user satisfaction and to inform the design of a randomised controlled trial of the technology. Materials and methods: Pre‐ and post‐meal BG results are transferred wirelessly in real‐time from a blood glucose meter to a smartphone app (where they can be annotated by the patient) and then to a server. The data are tabulated and presented on both the server and the smartphone in graphical formats with out‐of‐target colour codes. Diabetes specialist midwives and doctors review the automatically‐prioritised data and recommend dose changes by text messages or phone calls. Women can request a call from their care team to discuss their diabetes, which the diabetes midwife can schedule around her other tasks. The technology has been used by 50 women with GDM from two Oxfordshire hospitals. Results: To date, 41 women have finished using the system, all of whom have had live births. 15,609 BG results have been transmitted. The women tagged 98% of these readings with annotations indicating whether they were taken before or after a meal. Free text comments from the women about diet and other factors were attached to 16% of the readings. The clinical care team sent 403 text messages to the women, including 110 medication adjustments. Initial prescriptions of metformin or insulin were given in clinic but dose adjustment to manage the progressively rising glucose levels were also given by phone in response to regular inspection of the automatically‐prioritised results. Women made 56 requests for calls from their diabetes midwife, primarily to obtain prescriptions, lancets and strips (39% of calls) or discuss their diet and medication (18%). Of 32 women who have returned questionnaires to date, 31 (97%) agreed that the system was convenient (27 strongly agreed) and 31 women (97%) agreed that the method of monitoring fitted with their lifestyle (20 strongly agreed). All 32 women reported a good relationship with their diabetes care team. Conclusion: The GDm‐Health system allowing remote delivery of care works well in clinical practice and has been positively received by patients and healthcare professionals. A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to establish whether its use can maintain effectiveness while improving quality and efficiency of care, with fewer clinic visits and time and cost savings for both patients and the health service.

AB: BACKGROUND: Obese men who consume alcohol are at a greatly increased risk of liver disease; those who drink > 14 units of alcohol per week have a 19‐fold increased risk of dying from liver disease. OBJECTIVES: To develop an intervention to reduce alcohol consumption in obese men and to assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate its effectiveness. DESIGN OF THE INTERVENTION: The intervention was developed using formative research, public involvement and behaviour change theory. It was organised in two phases, comprising a face‐to‐face session with trained laypeople (study co‐ordinators) followed by a series of text messages. Participants explored how alcohol consumption contributed to weight gain, both through direct calorie consumption and through its effect on increasing food consumption, particularly of high‐calorie foodstuffs. Men were encouraged to set goals to reduce their alcohol consumption and to make specific plans to do so. The comparator group received an active control in the form of a conventional alcohol brief intervention. Randomisation was carried out using the secure remote web‐based system provided by the Tayside Clinical Trials Unit. Randomisation was stratified by the recruitment method and restricted using block sizes of randomly varying lengths. Members of the public were involved in the development of all study methods. SETTING: Men were recruited from the community, from primary care registers and by time‐space sampling (TSS). The intervention was delivered in community settings such as the participant's home, community centres and libraries. PARTICIPANTS: Men aged 35‐64 years who had a body mass index (BMI) of > 30 kg/m2 and who drank > 21 units of alcohol per week. RESULTS: The screening methods successfully identified participants meeting the entry criteria. Trial recruitment was successful, with 69 men (36 from 419 approached in primary care, and 33 from 470 approached via TSS) recruited and randomised in 3 months. Of the 69 men randomised, 35 were allocated to the intervention group and 34 to the control group. The analysis was conducted on 31 participants from the intervention group and 30 from the control group. The participants covered a wide range of ages and socioeconomic statuses. The average alcohol consumption of the men recruited was 47.2 units per week, more than twice that of the entry criterion (> 21 units per week). Most (78%) engaged in binge drinking (> 8 units in a session) at least weekly. Almost all (95%) exceeded the threshold for a 19‐fold increase in the risk of dying from liver disease (BMI of > 30 kg/m2 and > 14 units of alcohol per week). Despite this, they believed that they were at low risk of harm from alcohol, possibly because they seldom suffered acute harms (e.g. hangovers) and made few visits to a general practitioner or hospital. INTERVENTION: The intervention was delivered with high fidelity. A high follow‐up rate was achieved (98%) and the outcomes for the full RCT were measured. A process evaluation showed that participants engaged with the main components of the intervention. The acceptability of the study methods was high. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study developed a novel intervention and evaluated all of the stages of a RCT that would test the effectiveness of the intervention. The main stages of a trial were completed successfully: recruitment, randomisation, intervention delivery, follow‐up and measurement of study outcomes. Most of the men recruited drank very heavily and were also obese. This places them at a very high risk of liver disease, making them a priority for intervention. FUTURE WORK: A RCT to test the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of the intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN55309164.

KY: Arthritis; Arthritis, Rheumatoid
AB: To improve monitoring of patients with early RA the investigators have developed an automated remote monitoring system SandRA (Showing‐any‐need‐for‐Re‐Assessment) based on short message service (SMS) of cell phones and patients' global assessment of the severity of RA (PtGA) on a numeric scale of 0 to 10. SandRA software sends every 2 to 6 weeks automatically an SMS to a patient's cell phone, and the patient answers by one push on keyboard. The patients' answers are recorded in SandRA and automatically analysed. If answers indicate non‐adherence, adverse events, or missed target, the system automatically sends SMS: "Your nurse will call you within 2 work days", and the nurse gets an alarm by e‐mail. If needed, an extra visit is arranged for treatment adjustment. Preliminary studies show that PtGA given by cell phone has sufficient convergent validity. Structured feedback from patients has been favourable and most professionals assess the system as feasible. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of SandRA monitoring on clinical outcomes of RA, on patients' quality of life and drug adherence, as well as consumed resources. Cost‐effectiveness of SandRa is estimated. Methods Consecutive incident patients (200) with RA are enrolled. Those, who can use SMS messages of cell phone, who understand the SandRA system, and are willing, are included. After informed consent the patients are randomized into two groups: 1) SandRA group and 2) control group. The patients randomized into SandRA group are instructed as usual. Regular doctor visits are scheduled at 3 months and at 6 months, when the SandRa monitoring ends. The following clinical data will be gathered. 1) ACR core data set at baseline, at 3 and 6 months, and at possible extra visits; 2) radiographs of the hands and the feet at baseline (if not taken within 6 months); 3) antirheumatic medication and the possible causes of switches and changes over the 6 months 4) patient confidence (VAS) at each doctor visit; 5) quality of life (SF‐36) at baseline and at 6 months. Patient feedback of the system by a structured questionnaire is gathered at 6 months. The patients in the control group are treated as usual. Follow‐up visits are scheduled as needed. The same clinical data as in SandRA group are collected at baseline and at 6 months. In the both groups concomitant diseases and medications as well as age, sex, and education level are recorded at baseline. The consumption of resources is assessed as the number of contacts (doctor visits, nurse visits, as well as phone calls scheduled and non‐scheduled) with the outpatient clinic over the 6‐month follow‐up. In addition, the patients are assessed at 12 months, when the ACR Core Data Set is gathered. The radiographs at baseline and ACR Core Data Set at doctor visits, safety laboratory tests, and assessment visits at 3, 6, and 12 months are included in the normal clinical care. No extra visits are required because of the study.

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03654690
YR: 2018
KY: HIV Infections
AB: HIV disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States, and new infections continue to increase particularly among African American (AA) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L) MSM. Past studies estimate that up to 50% of these new infections originate from the approximately 20% of MSM who are unaware of their status. Expanded HIV testing can produce reductions in incidence when implemented on a broad scale by facilitating earlier diagnosis and treatment. Rates of HIV testing are particularly low among AA and H/L MSM, and innovative approaches to encourage testing may help address high incidence in these men. Home‐based, self‐testing (HBST) for HIV offers considerable promise for increasing the number of MSM who are aware of their status by overcoming key barriers to clinic‐based testing, such as inconvenience and confidentiality concerns. HBST may also be particularly well‐suited for AA and H/L MSM, given that stigma and mistrust of medical care contribute to low testing rates. Despite its promise, however, many are concerned that HBST does not sufficiently connect users with critical post‐testing resources, such as confirmatory testing and care among those who test positive, and that these limitations may result in delayed linkage to care. Existing, FDA‐approved HBST kits provide a free, 24‐hour helpline that offers these services to those who seek it, but few users do, and this "passive" approach may miss critical opportunities to engage with MSM for further prevention services. To address these challenges, the investigators developed a mobile health platform ("eTEST") that uses internet‐of‐things (IoT) technologies to monitor when HBST users open their tests in real time, allowing the investigators to provide timely, "active" follow‐up counseling and referral over the phone after they do so. In a pilot study, the investigators show that providing HBST by mail at regular intervals boosted rates of any/repeat HIV testing among high‐risk MSM compared with clinic‐based testing reminders. Moreover, those who received follow‐up phone counseling after HBST were more likely to receive risk reduction counseling, to consult with a medical provider about PrEP, and to initiate PrEP. Given these promising results, the proposed research will conduct a fully‐powered efficacy trial of this approach in areas with large populations of AA and H/L MSM and high HIV incidence: Jackson, MS, Los Angeles, CA, and Boston, MA. High‐risk MSM who have not tested for HIV in the last year will be recruited from MSM‐oriented "hook‐up" mobile apps, and assigned to receive either (1) HBST with post‐test phone counseling/referral ("eTEST" condition), (2) "standard" HBST without active follow‐up, or (3) reminders to get tested for HIV at a local clinic ("control" condition) at three month intervals over the course of 12 months. The investigators will explore the impact of the eTEST system on key outcomes, including rates of HIV testing, receipt of additional HIV prevention services, and PrEP initiation, compared with standard HBST or clinic‐based testing reminders alone. The investigators will also explore the cost effectiveness of the eTEST system under various scenarios compared with relying on traditional, clinic‐based testing alone.

KY: Celecoxib; Tramadol
AB: The intrauterine device (IUD) is a commonly used long‐acting, effective and reversible method of contraception. IUD insertion is usually associated with a variable degree of pain. The majority of women experience mild pain or discomfort during IUD insertion, and some women may experience severe pain. Nulliparous women, women who delivered only by cesarean section and women remote from vaginal delivery are subgroups of women who experience more pain during IUD insertion. Prophylactic pharmacological interventions for management of pain associated with IUD insertion include nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioid analgesics including Tramadol. Tramadol hydrochloride is an orally active centrally acting synthetic opioid. It is an atypical analgesic with a dual mechanism of action: serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and modest l‐opioid agonist. It has a lower incidence of respiratory depression, cardiac depression, side effects on smooth muscle and abuse potential as compared to typical opioid agents. Cervical ripening with prostaglandins was suggested facilitate the introduction of the IUD through the cervix, although at the cost of increased pain due to uterine cramping. The study objective is to compare the effectiveness and side effects of oral Tramadol 100mg versus oral Celecoxib 200mg in reducing pain associated with operative outpatient hysteroscopy in an attempt to find the most effective drug with the least possible side effects to be used before IUD insertion. Two hundred and ten women requesting IUD insertion will be randomly divided into three equal groups. To ensure blinding the double dummy technique will be used in which group 1 will receive Tramadol 100mg (Trama®, Global Napi, Giza, Egypt) orally in addition to a placebo similar to Celecoxib, group 2 will receive Celecoxib 200mg (Celebrex® 200, Pfizer, USA) in addition to a placebo similar to Tramadol, and group 3 will received a placebo similar to Tramadol in addition to a placebo similar to Celecoxib. All the drugs will be given 2 hour before the procedure. An independent person will generate the allocation sequence using computer generated random numbers. The researchers will performed bimanual examination, introduce a speculum into the vagina and sterilized the cervix with povidone iodine before inserting the IUD according to the manufacturer recommendations. After insertion of the IUD the women's pain perception will be assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) graduated from zero to 10 with zero corresponding to no pain and 10 corresponding to the worst possible pain. Quantitative data will be statistically represented in terms of mean ± standard deviation (± SD) while categorical data will be represented as frequency and percentage. Comparison of quantitative data will be done using ANOVA test for independent samples while categorical data will be compared using Chi squared test or Fisher exact test when appropriate. A probability value (p value) less than 0.05 will be considered significant. To the best of the investigators' knowledge this is the first trial to investigate the role of Celecoxib and oral Tramadol in reducing IUD insertion associated pain, with no previous data to calculate the sample size with. Assuming that the response will be normally distributed, the sample size is calculated to detect a mean difference of 1 unit between Tramadol and Celecoxib pain scores during the procedure (lower difference are not considered clinically relevant) using VAS assuming that the within group standard deviation will be 2. The investigators will need to study 64 cases in each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the Tramadol and Celecoxib are equal with probability (power) 0.8. The investigators added 6 cases to each arm accounting for any missing data and procedure failure ending in 70 cases in each group. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05 using Student's t test for independent samples. Sample size calculation is done using Stats Direct statistical software version 2.7.2 for Windows, Stats Direct Ltd., Cheshire, UK.

YR: 2018
AB: The investigators hypothesize that a mobile device‐based symptom assessment, control and communication application (m‐Palliative Care Link (mPCL) will extend access to palliative care specialists (hereafter named specialists), resulting in: a) symptom control information exchange between specialists, patients, and local health workers and b) reduced symptom burden in late‐stage cancer patients. This hypothesis will be tested by accomplishing the following specific aims in the two‐year study period: Aim 1. In partnership with local palliative care specialists, to design and create a secure mobile communication application (m‐Palliative Care Link; mPCL) for facilitating remote assessment of and communication about patient symptom control needs among specialists, patients/caregivers, and local health workers (all of whom are referred to here as user groups). mPCL will: ‐ Regularly deliver the APCA POS (hereafter POS) to the cancer patient/caregiver via mobile device; allow them to complete the outcome scale on this device; and return responses to the specialist and local health worker for access via a secure website. ‐ Enable specialist POS review/action in partnership with the local health worker. ‐ Allow the specialist to communicate with the patient/caregiver and local health worker regarding further symptom assessment and control based on existing standards and the patient's desires and needs. ‐ Enable the specialist to generate/update patient records for ongoing review. ‐ Record and track symptom control as a trajectory throughout the patient's illness via collection, storage, and analysis of POS responses. Aim 2. To usability test an mPCL prototype through a combination of hands‐on observation/feedback and survey‐based assessment of ease of use and suggestions for change among 5‐7 participants from each user group. Usability test data will be used to improve mPCL design for subsequent field test (see Aim 3). Aim 3. To field test and validate usability of mPCL among 45 late‐stage cancer patients. Late‐stage cancer patients, who are eligible for the study, will be enrolled/consented, trained on mPCL use, and provided with an mPCL‐equipped mobile device prior to discharge from ORCI. An mPCL record and discharge care plan will be generated by the specialist on his/her personal computer and communicated with the patient's local health worker for review and ongoing remote care communication and coordination. Field tests will continue for 4 months or until patient death. Through a combination of surveys and interviews of user groups, investigators will: determine the feasibility, acceptability, barriers, and facilitators of mPCL for communication and action regarding symptom assessment, information exchange, and symptom control; further optimize mPCL for ongoing study; determine the projected per patient cost of mPCL implementation; and gather rich data on the symptom control needs of Tanzanian cancer patients. Aim 4. To collect preliminary data comparing field test symptom outcomes with 45 usual care patients (ORCI palliative care clinic patients). Patients will be identified, enrolled and consented during their scheduled outpatient clinic visit. POS responses will be collected at the time of each clinic visit for up to 4 months. Through examination/between‐group comparisons (mPCL intervention versus usual care) of symptom‐based outcomes and medication type, dose and duration, investigators will collect preliminary data on mPCL impact that is critical to design of a future large‐scale, randomized mPCL outcomes study.

AB: Hypertension (HBP) is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease and has become a common public health problem world wide due to increased longevity. The challenge for next decades is to improve the adherence of patients with chronic degenerative diseases. It is detected that hypertension has been considered a risk factor for determining the incidence of cardiovascular diseases, which directs it to the high cost of treatment in Brazilian public health, therefore the prevention of impairment to health is a priority. Many patients with hypertension do not make the required behavioral changes in your lifestyle, do not forget to take medications or taking medication to fulfil the effective control of the disease. The present study aims to assess the impact of a health promotion program using the Therapeutic Communication and Educational Technology associated of the telemedicine (E‐Care of Hypertension) in the performance improvement of patient adherence to treatment. This study aims to evaluation the impact of health promotion program on therapeutic compliance in hypertensive patients, of difficult control of blood pressure levels, with individual guidance through nursing consultation every 20 days, using the approach of "Therapeutic Communication" associated "Educational Technology" for a period of 120 days. For this study will be conducted with 60 patients randomly divided into four groups, according to the care of new cases registered in Ambulatory Hypertension Unit of Heart Institute at Medical School of São Paulo University. The sample will be selected for convenience in accordance with the established day of the week depending on availability of researchers and patients' consent. This approach may be associated or not with the use of educational technology in a virtual learning environment (VLE) for distance learning (DL).This was a prospective randomized clinical study conducted with the following 4 groups of hypertensive patients: This was a prospective randomized clinical study conducted with the following 4 groups of hypertensive patients: Embracement: Group receiving individual orientation required by an embracement strategy characterized by 7 nursing visits at 20‐day intervals, for 4 months; Group VLE using a technological education strategy (E‐Care of Hypertension) for distance learning (DL) and making 7 nursing visits at 20‐day intervals, for 4 months; Control Group that performed 1 nursing visit at baseline and 1 after 120 days.). Group E‐blended learning using a technological education strategy (E‐Care of Hypertension) which is evaluating the influence of the use of educational technology associated with face‐to‐face consultation with the health professional (Blended E‐learning) and making 7 nursing visits at 20‐day intervals, for 4 months. At baseline and after 120 days, the following tools were applied: The Spielberger State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Morisky test, WHOQOL, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The VLE group had remote access to the "E‐Care of Hypertension" site (6 specific educational modules).The E‐BLENDED Group had acess to "E‐Care of Hypertension" site (6 specific educational modules) with the presence of the nurse.

DOI: 10.1111/j.1099-1611.2013.3393
AB: BACKGROUND: A child's cancer diagnosis severely challenges parents' coping skills and can reduce quality of life (QoL) for all family members. Despite documented need, few equitable and costeffective psychological interventions are available for parents of young survivors. Our team developed an online group intervention‐ 'Cascade' (Cope, Adapt, Survive: life after CAncEr'), which aims to improve QoL and reduce distress and fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) in parents of children aged <15 years. METHOD: In this trial, Cascade was delivered by a psychologist in three weekly, 2 hour videoconferencing modules, with 3‐5 parents/carers per group. Anchored in skills‐based cognitivebehavioural therapy (CBT), each module is tailored to parents' recognised concerns in the post‐treatment period. Parents were randomised to Cascade or to a 6‐month waitlist, and completed three questionnaires (at baseline, 2 weeks and 6 months postintervention). To date, 19 parents have completed the program (23 opted in; response rate: 51%). Further groups are underway. Ninety‐percent of participants have completed every Cascade module, and parents have successfully connected from multiple settings. RESULTS: Early data appear to confirm Cascade's potential preventative role, with waitlisted parents' QoL worsening after cancer treatment completion [QoL scores at time 1: 25.0 (SD 3.7), at time 2: 24.4 (4.1)], while Cascade parents either improved, or avoided decline, over the same time period [time 1: 22.8 (4.1), at time 2: 23.3 (2.7)]. Cascade participants also reported that: the 'online format was easy to use' (100% 'agreed'), 'module topics were relevant to me' (89%), 'I learnt new skills' (89%), 'I enjoyed talking to other parents' (100%) and 'the homework helped put my skills into practice' (89%). CONCLUSIONS: Cascade is acceptable to parents of children recovering from cancer and is feasible to deliver. Cascade has the potential to yield positive outcomes for parents, particularly with regard to QoL in the first months after cancer treatment completion. This project directly addresses the inequity in psychological support received by parents after their child's cancer treatment: an acute concern for families residing in rural and remote communities. By combining proven CBT techniques with innovative technology, Cascade is an urgently needed next step to improve mental health outcomes in a vulnerable population. RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS: The results presented here have enabled the development of a multicentre, Phase II randomised controlled trial which will be implemented Australia‐wide in 2014/15. Participants will include 120 parents/carers, randomised to three arms: Cascade, non‐directive online peer support, or a waitlist control. The inclusion of a peer‐support group as a control complies with gold standards and will ensure rigorous assessment of the CBT features unique to Cascade. The trial will also incorporate rigorous cost consequence analyses. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Cascade is a selective preventative program. Parents who do not adjust well to a traumatic event (e.g. cancer) parent their children less effectively. The 'coming off treatment' phase is a time of psychological vulnerability for parents and a window of opportunity to prevent ongoing mental health problems and family challenges. We have shown that parents are receptive to implementing CBT skills into their lives, and are willing to receive psychological support delivered online.

TI: Mobile App With Patient Financial Incentives for Adherence to Heart Failure Medications & Daily Self-Weighing
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03034551
YR: 2017
KY: Body Weight; Heart Failure; Heart Failure, Systolic
AB: Nonadherence to cardiovascular medications and daily weight monitoring are critical issues in readmissions to the hospital for heart failure. Only 60% of patients adhere to prescribed cardiovascular medications on at least 80% of days, and only 40% monitor their weight daily, despite owning scales. Nationally, nonadherence contributes to excessive HF readmission rates of 50% within 6 months, and 24% within 30 days of discharge. To raise awareness and accountability, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began reporting these rates in 2009, and the Affordable Care Act and value‐based contracts with payers have established financial penalties to spur provider‐based solutions. Telehealth interventions are an ideal, low‐cost, scalable method to reduce readmissions by remotely enhancing patient support. Telehealth interventions for HF that target medication compliance and self‐weighing have demonstrated reductions in readmission rates by 80% or more, but these are not yet widely adopted in clinical practice due to a lack of randomized, controlled studies. We are thus proposing a randomized, controlled study of a proprietary telehealth platform at University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro (UMCPP) to enable remote support for HF patients through a mobile app combined with financial incentives to motivate adherence to medication and self‐weighing. Patients admitted to UMCPP with the primary admitting or discharge diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF<40%) (ICD‐10 codes I50.2_) will be invited to participate in the study. Each patient in the intervention arm will be offered $150 in incentives along with the Wellth app loaded on to his or her smartphone. When users first log in to the app, which will occur with the guidance of a healthcare provider trained in its use, they will be shown a large dollar amount that they have earned by enrolling in the program ‐ in this study $150 will be offered for 90 days of perfect adherence to medications and daily self‐weighing using connected digital scales provided by Wellth. Instructions will also be given stating that missed weight and medication check‐ins will result in a $2 deduction per day from the account to be paid out at each monthly pay period. If a 2 lb. or greater daily increase in weight, or a 5 lb. weekly increase in weight, is detected in any patient, a UMCPP physician or nurse will be alerted via automatic email and text. A physician or a nurse will then call the patient to assess the patient's symptoms (i.e. increasing shortness of breath or decreases in exertional tolerance, medication and dietary adherence). Once a weight gain alert has been triggered, the team will continue to receive additional data about the patient for the next 7 days to see if weight continues to increase which would trigger an additional phone call and patient physician notification. After a call is made to the patient, if, in the clinical judgment of the physician or nurse that there are increasing heart failure symptoms, the physician or nurse will suggest to the patient that they make an appointment and see their doctor within the next 48 hours. Benefits of this study to the intervention arm include better health, reduced risk of readmission, and concomitant reduction in healthcare burden, as well as a small but tangible financial gain. Benefits for society, assuming widely applicable success, include reduction in population‐wide readmission rates due to greater health, and reduction in healthcare spending.

AB: Introduction: Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) is a common nosocomial infection. The most commonly prescribed treatments, metronidazole and vancomycine, have a primary cure rat of 90% but 1 in 4 cases suffer a relapse in the following months. A disrupted microbiota is thought to increase the risk of relapse. Rifaximin is a non‐absorbable antibiotic that suppresses C.difficile proliferation. In a trial of 68 patients Garey et al. found that a course of rifaximin after standard therapy reduced relapse rate though not significantly1. Aims & Methods: We aimed to further investigate the efficacy of rifaximin to prevent CDAD relapse in a parallel group, randomised, placebo controlled trial in 23 hospitals in England. Population: age>=18 with resolution of CDAD after treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin, defined as cessation of diarrhoea for >=2 days. CDAD diagnosis required evidence of toxin production or pseudomembranes at endoscopy. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy or breast feeding; life expectancy <4 weeks; unable to take intervention (hypersensitivity or swallowing disorder); >5 days elapsed since treatment. Randomisation was stratified by hospital using a remote, internet‐based system. Participants, clinicians and researchers were blind to allocation. Intervention: Rifaximin 1200 mg daily for two weeks then 600 mg daily for two weeks, in three divided doses. Comparator: identical placebo. Primary Outcome: relapse <=12 weeks after treatment initiation, defined as diarrhoea (>=3 type 6 or 7 stools per day) for 2 days with evidence of toxin production. Sample size: The planned sample size was 180 to detect a difference in relapse of 20% (30% placebo, 10% rifaximin) with 80% power, allowing for loss to follow‐up of 20%. EudraCT 2012‐003205‐10; www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01670149; ISRCTN 65163992 Results: Recruitment occurred December 2012‐March 2016. Of 2157 patients screened, 151 were eligible, willing and randomised before funding limits were reached (74 placebo, 77 rifaximin). Primary outcome data were available on 130. Mean age was 71.9 (SD 15.3). 36% were in‐patients at start of intervention. 13% had a prior recorded episode of CDAD. 26% were using proton pump inhibitors pror to CDAD diagnosis, with a higher rate of use in the rifaximin group (32% vs. 20%). 18/61 (29.5%) on placebo relapsed within 12 weeks compared to 11/69 (15.9%) on rifaximin, a difference between groups of ‐13.7% (95% CI ‐28.1% to 0.7%, p=0.06). The risk ratio was 0.54 (95% CI 0.28 to 1.05, p=0.07). During 6‐month safety follow up 9 participants died in each group (12%). Adverse event rates were similar between groups. Conclusion: CDAD relapse rate was 13.7% lower than on placebo. The confidence interval means that lack of effect remains possible but the estimated effect size is similar to Garey's trial1 with meta‐analysis of the trials showing a statistically significant effect. The effect size is similar to that reported for fidaxomicin at 40 days2, or for bezlotoxumab at 3 months3. Age and mortality rate were higher in our trial which may reflect greater similarity to the population at risk. Comparative trials of the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of alternative treatment strategies should follow.

AB: Background: Obese men who consume alcohol are at a greatly increased risk of liver disease; those who drink > 14 units of alcohol per week have a 19‐fold increased risk of dying from liver disease. Objectives: To develop an intervention to reduce alcohol consumption in obese men and to assess the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate its effectiveness. Design of the intervention: The intervention was developed using formative research, public involvement and behaviour change theory. It was organised in two phases, comprising a face‐to‐face session with trained laypeople (study co‐ordinators) followed by a series of text messages. Participants explored how alcohol consumption contributed to weight gain, both through direct calorie consumption and through its effect on increasing food consumption, particularly of high‐calorie foodstuffs. Men were encouraged to set goals to reduce their alcohol consumption and to make specific plans to do so. The comparator group received an active control in the form of a conventional alcohol brief intervention. Randomisation was carried out using the secure remote web‐based system provided by the Tayside Clinical Trials Unit. Randomisation was stratified by the recruitment method and restricted using block sizes of randomly varying lengths. Members of the public were involved in the development of all study methods. Setting: Men were recruited from the community, from primary care registers and by time‐space sampling (TSS). The intervention was delivered in community settings such as the participant's home, community centres and libraries. Participants: Men aged 35‐64 years who had a body mass index (BMI) of > 30 kg/m2 and who drank > 21 units of alcohol per week. Results: The screening methods successfully identified participants meeting the entry criteria. Trial recruitment was successful, with 69 men (36 from 419 approached in primary care, and 33 from 470 approached via TSS) recruited and randomised in 3 months. Of the 69 men randomised, 35 were allocated to the intervention group and 34 to the control group. The analysis was conducted on 31 participants from the intervention group and 30 from the control group. The participants covered a wide range of ages and socioeconomic statuses. The average alcohol consumption of the men recruited was 47.2 units per week, more than twice that of the entry criterion (> 21 units per week). Most (78%) engaged in binge drinking (> 8 units in a session) at least weekly. Almost all (95%) exceeded the threshold for a 19‐fold increase in the risk of dying from liver disease (BMI of > 30 kg/m2 and > 14 units of alcohol per week). Despite this, they believed that they were at low risk of harm from alcohol, possibly because they seldom suffered acute harms (e.g. hangovers) and made few visits to a general practitioner or hospital. Intervention: The intervention was delivered with high fidelity. A high follow‐up rate was achieved (98%) and the outcomes for the full RCT were measured. A process evaluation showed that participants engaged with the main components of the intervention. The acceptability of the study methods was high. Conclusions: This feasibility study developed a novel intervention and evaluated all of the stages of a RCT that would test the effectiveness of the intervention. The main stages of a trial were completed successfully: recruitment, randomisation, intervention delivery, follow‐up and measurement of study outcomes. Most of the men recruited drank very heavily and were also obese. This places them at a very high risk of liver disease, making them a priority for intervention. Future work: A RCT to test the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of the intervention. Copyright © Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO 2017.

AB: Background: Demand for online information and help exceeds most other forms of self‐help. Web‐assisted tobacco interventions (WATIs) offer a potentially low‐cost way to reach millions of smokers who wish to quit smoking and to test various forms of online assistance for use/utilization and user satisfaction. Objectives: Our primary aim was to determine the utilization of and satisfaction with 2 versions of a smoking cessation website (smokefree.gov), one of which included an asynchronous bulletin board (BB condition). A secondary goal was to measure changes in smoking behavior 3 months after enrollment in the study. Methods: All participants were adult federal employees or contractors to the federal government who responded to an email and indicated a willingness to quit smoking in 30 days. We randomly assigned participants to either the BB condition or the publicly available version ‐ usual care (UC) ‐ and then assessed the number of minutes of website use and satisfaction with each condition as well as changes in smoking behavior. Results: Among the 1375 participants, 684 were randomized to the BB intervention, and 691 to the control UC condition. A total of 39.7% returned a follow‐up questionnaire after 3 months, with similar rates across the two groups (UC: n=279, 40.3%; BB: n=267, 39.0%). Among those respondents assigned to the BB condition, only 81 participants (11.8%) elected to view the bulletin board or post a message, limiting our ability to analyze the impact of bulletin board use on cessation. Satisfaction with the website was high and did not differ significantly between conditions (UC: 90.2%, BB: 84.9%, P= .08). Utilization, or minutes spent on the website, was significantly longer for the BB than the UC condition (18.0 vs 11.1, P = .01) and was nearly double for those who remained in the study (21.2) than for those lost to follow‐up (9.6, P< .001). Similar differences were observed between those who made a serious quit attempt versus those who did not (22.4 vs 10.4, P= .02) and between those with a quit date on or a few days prior to the enrollment date versus those with a later quit date (29.4 vs 12.5, P = .001). There were no statistically significant differences in quit rates between the BB and UC group, both in intent‐to‐treat analysis (ITT) and in analyzing the adherence subgroup (respondents) only. Combined across the UC and BB groups, 7‐day abstinence was 6.8% with ITT and 17.6% using only participants in the follow‐up (adherence). For participants who attempted to quit within a few days of study entry (vs 30 days), quit rates were 29.6% (ITT) and 44.4% (adherence). Conclusions: Quit rates for participants were similar to other WATIs, with the most favorable outcomes demonstrated by smokers ready to quit at the time of enrolling in the trial and smokers using pharmacotherapy. Utilization of the asynchronous bulletin board was lower than expected, and did not have an impact on outcomes (quit rates). Given the demand for credible online resources for smoking cessation, future studies should continue to evaluate use of and satisfaction with Web features and to clarify results in terms of time since last cigarette as well as use of pharmacotherapy.

Because the intervention will last considerably longer than the pilot, refresher activities will be delivered at 6 and 9 months. Component 2 ‐ mHealth for those at high risk of CMDs: Training of ASHAs and PHC doctors will be provided both face to face and via the virtual conferencing platform developed in the pilot. The high‐risk cohort will be followed up by ASHAs for ongoing assessment and management. ASHAs will provide basic supportive advice and a referral to the PHC doctor. Participants will be electronically referred via the mHealth platform and also provided with a paper referral card to take to the doctor. The PHC doctor will review participants as part of a village health camp visit or the patient will visit the PHC. Patients requiring medication will receive these directly from the PHC or purchase low cost generics from a pharmacy that we have engaged as part of the project. Complex cases will be referred to a psychiatrist in the next tier of the public health system. The psychiatrist will also conduct case reviews via phone and/or Skype with the doctors to enhance their management skills. ASHAs will conduct follow‐up visits and assess treatment adherence using the recall and reminder system installed on their mobile devices. Priority patients will have a red traffic light alert and be automati CONDITION: Mental Health PRIMARY OUTCOME: To assess the mHealth/ task‐sharing component ‐ the difference at end of trial in the proportion of people achieving remission (defined as all of the following: PHQ‐9 5, GAD‐7 5 and suicide risk score 2). ; ; To evaluate the anti‐stigma intervention ‐ the difference in mean behaviour scores at end of trial using the Mental Health Knowledge, Attitude and Behaviour (KAB) scale ; ‐‐‐‐‐‐Timepoint: 3months ; 6 months ; 12 months and 18 months ; SECONDARY OUTCOME: To assess the mHealth/ task‐sharing component the standardised mean difference in PHQ‐9 and GAD‐7 scores ; the proportion at high risk of CMDs who have visited a doctor at least once in the previous 18 months and change from baseline in mean stigma scores ; ; To evaluate the anti‐stigma intervention ; the change in mean knowledge and attitude scores and change in stigma perceptions as assessed by Barriers to Access to Care Evaluation‐ Treatment Stigma Subscale (BACE‐TS version 3) ; ‐‐‐‐‐‐Timepoint: 3 months ; 6 months ; 12 and 18 months INCLUSION CRITERIA: All consenting adults â?¥ 18 years of age

AB: BACKGROUND: Demand for online information and help exceeds most other forms of self‐help. Web‐assisted tobacco interventions (WATIs) offer a potentially low‐cost way to reach millions of smokers who wish to quit smoking and to test various forms of online assistance for use/utilization and user satisfaction. OBJECTIVES: Our primary aim was to determine the utilization of and satisfaction with 2 versions of a smoking cessation website (smokefree.gov), one of which included an asynchronous bulletin board (BB condition). A secondary goal was to measure changes in smoking behavior 3 months after enrollment in the study. METHODS: All participants were adult federal employees or contractors to the federal government who responded to an email and indicated a willingness to quit smoking in 30 days. We randomly assigned participants to either the BB condition or the publicly available version‐‐usual care (UC)‐‐and then assessed the number of minutes of website use and satisfaction with each condition as well as changes in smoking behavior. RESULTS: Among the 1375 participants, 684 were randomized to the BB intervention, and 691 to the control UC condition. A total of 39.7% returned a follow‐up questionnaire after 3 months, with similar rates across the two groups (UC: n=279, 40.3%; BB: n=267, 39.0%). Among those respondents assigned to the BB condition, only 81 participants (11.8%) elected to view the bulletin board or post a message, limiting our ability to analyze the impact of bulletin board use on cessation. Satisfaction with the website was high and did not differ significantly between conditions (UC: 90.2%, BB: 84.9%, P= .08). Utilization, or minutes spent on the website, was significantly longer for the BB than the UC condition (18.0 vs 11.1, P = .01) and was nearly double for those who remained in the study (21.2) than for those lost to follow‐up (9.6, P< .001). Similar differences were observed between those who made a serious quit attempt versus those who did not (22.4 vs 10.4, P= .02) and between those with a quit date on or a few days prior to the enrollment date versus those with a later quit date (29.4 vs 12.5, P = .001). There were no statistically significant differences in quit rates between the BB and UC group, both in intent‐to‐treat analysis (ITT) and in analyzing the adherence subgroup (respondents) only. Combined across the UC and BB groups, 7‐day abstinence was 6.8% with ITT and 17.6% using only participants in the follow‐up (adherence). For participants who attempted to quit within a few days of study entry (vs 30 days), quit rates were 29.6% (ITT) and 44.4% (adherence). CONCLUSIONS: Quit rates for participants were similar to other WATIs, with the most favorable outcomes demonstrated by smokers ready to quit at the time of enrolling in the trial and smokers using pharmacotherapy. Utilization of the asynchronous bulletin board was lower than expected, and did not have an impact on outcomes (quit rates). Given the demand for credible online resources for smoking cessation, future studies should continue to evaluate use of and satisfaction with Web features and to clarify results in terms of time since last cigarette as well as use of pharmacotherapy.

AB: Purpose: Cigarette smoking is the single greatest cause of preventable deaths. In the VA health care system, patients with chronic medical illnesses represent an important population on which to focus smoking cessation efforts. Smoking cessation among patients with chronic medical illnesses can substantially decrease morbidity and mortality. Despite these benefits, many patients with chronic medical illnesses continue to smoke. There is a strong interrelationship between depression and chronic medical illness. Depression can derail sustained smoking cessation and may be an important barrier to smoking cessation for Veterans with chronic medical illness. Despite the barriers they face, smokers with depression are motivated to quit smoking. Smokers with histories of depression may respond better to smoking cessation interventions that are augmented with mood‐management adjuncts such as mood‐management counseling. Thus, depressed smokers are more likely to quit when behavioral mood‐management is added to traditional cessation approaches. Yet, the augmentation of smoking cessation with behavioral mood management is not yet firmly established. Also these intensive interventions have limited reach when conducted in person. Telephone counseling can deliver intensive and effective treatment to people who smoke, yet its implementation has been limited among smoker with depression. There is a need to develop novel proactive telephone‐delivered approaches that can broadly deliver intensive smoking cessation interventions to Veterans who may not respond to standard care, such as those with chronic medical illnesses and depressive symptoms. Methodology: The investigators propose a randomized comparative effectiveness trial with a two‐group design in which 350 Veteran smokers with depression and chronic medical illness will be randomized to either: 1) smoking cessation plus adjunctive behavioral mood management (SMK‐MM group), an intervention that includes a proactive telehealth intervention that combines evidence‐based smoking cessation counseling augmented with behavioral mood management and a tele‐medicine clinic for accessing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), or 2) smoking cessation telephone counseling control (SMK CONTROL), a contact‐equivalent control that provides the same smoking cessation telephone counseling intervention augmented with health education (instead of mood‐management) and a tele‐medicine clinic for accessing NRT. Patients with chronic medical illnesses will be identified from patient intake systems of the Durham Veteran's Affairs Hospital and screened for tobacco use and depressive symptoms. The main outcome in this trial is prolonged abstinence at 6‐month and 12‐month follow‐up. Logistic regression will be used to test for a between‐group difference in the proportion of patients with self‐reported prolonged abstinence from cigarettes at 6 months. A general linear mixed model will be used to estimate changes depressive symptoms between groups. If there is a significant intervention effect on smoking cessation, meditational analysis will be conducted to examine whether changes in self‐efficacy, affect, and motivation to quit mediate the impact of the mood management intervention. Objectives: The specific aims of the study are to 1) evaluate the impact of a telephone‐delivered smoking cessation intervention augmented with behavioral mood management on rates of prolonged and point prevalence abstinence from cigarettes among Veterans with chronic medical illnesses and depression; 2) monitor the impact of behavioral mood management intervention on depressive symptoms; 3) if effective, assess whether change in self‐efficacy, positive and negative affect, and motivation to quit mediate the impact of behavioral mood management intervention on smoking cessation among Veterans; and 4) assess the cost‐effectiveness if the mood‐enhanced intervention.

KY: Alzheimer Disease; Dementia
AB: A 20+ year randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated the many benefits of a counseling and support intervention for spouse caregivers, the NYU Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI). The NYU Caregiver Intervention (NYUCI) is an evidence‐based intervention that provides counseling and support for families involved in the care of a relative or friend with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Most notably, the NYUCI substantially reduced caregiver's depressive symptoms, improved their physical health, and extended the time persons with ADRD remained at home by an average of 1.5 years (Mittelman et al., AG14634, formerly MH42216; See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17101889). The intervention is now being widely implemented in‐person, but there are barriers that prevent many caregivers from receiving its benefits, including geographic distance; impediments to older adults leaving their homes; and travel considerations for counselors which make it impossible to provide the NYUCI in person. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an online videoconferencing version of the NYUCI. This innovative application has massive implications for social service delivery to older adults, because it will make it possible to deliver an in‐person intervention, via the internet, which is already evidenced based to older adult caregivers who cannot currently be served. It will create the online reservation and management technology linking counselors with families as well as the evidence of effectiveness of providing such services via secure video teleconferencing vehicles. The proposed Telehealth Technology for Distance Counseling (TTDC) and related online educational training modules will connect skilled providers to the families of persons with dementia without regard to geographic location. Implications for rural healthcare delivery are particularly persuasive. To the investigators knowledge, this will be the first large‐scale TTDC to be developed and rigorously tested with a randomized controlled trial. The investigators hypothesize that such a system, coupled with online training for providers and families on tele‐ counseling and distance caregiving, will have similar benefits to those achieved with in‐person counseling during the original NYUCI RCT. This project includes an online reservation and management technology linking counselors with families via secure videoconferencing vehicles. The Telehealth Technology for Distance Counseling (TTDC), and online technology developed as part of this overall effort, will connect skilled providers to the families of persons with dementia without regard to geographic location. The related online clinical modules (i.e., interactive, computer‐based educational materials) developed as a part of this grant effort will prepare counselors to provide the intervention, and caregivers to utilize the internet software, to be able to participate in counseling. The TTDC will include a scheduling system to link counselors to families at their mutual convenience and assure delivery in a cost‐effective manner. The TTDC has the additional potential to transform ADRD care in ethnic and culturally diverse communities by connecting highly trained NYUCI counselors with specialized language and cultural skills to families who would not have access to these resources locally. In this study investigators will have 240 caregivers navigate the online educational module and the online reservation system for connecting caregivers with social workers. Half of the caregivers will then be paired with social service providers to receive counseling over the telephone, and the other half with be paired with social service providers to receive counseling via Zoom, a video conferencing program.

AB: Background: According to Danish national guidelines issued in 2015, pts (pts) with inflammatory rheumatic diseases in routine care treatment with originator infliximab (INX) must switch to the cheaper biosimilar infliximab (CT‐P13). This switch was done for economic reasons (CT‐P13 64% cheaper than INX). Since any treatment change potentially induces additional guidance of pts and use of hospital services, it is relevant to investigate whether the switch affected use of hospital resources. Objectives: To study difference in rates of outpatient activities and services provided 6 months before vs after the switch to CT‐P13 for pts treated at rheumatologic departments which provide infliximab treatment. Methods: The switch population and switch dates were identified in the Danish quality registry, DANBIO (1). Vital status was validated in the Central Person Registry. The Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) provided information regarding outpatient contacts and services. The use of 16 types of services relevant to the rheumatologic specialty was identified and included outpatient visits, infliximab infusion, nurse counselling, phone consultation, and rheumatologic ultrasound. Number of days with these services was counted. Services performed on the switch date were analyzed separately. Thus, for each patient the following rates were calculated 6 months before and after the switch: 1) days with at least one outpatient service provided, and 2) number of services provided. In addition, the weekly rate of days with services was calculated. Only pts who were alive and could be followed in the NPR for 6 full months after the switch were included. Paired t‐tests were used to compare rates before and after switch. A graphical interrupted time series analysis was conducted for weekly number of services provided. Results: Among 802 pts identified, 769 had available NPR outpatient data from hospital departments of rheumatology. The 769 pts had 1484 outpatient treatment contacts at the included rheumatology departments with a total of 9243 days with services provided (including 693 on the switch date). The mean rate of days with services provided was 5.4 before the switch and 5.7 after switch (p=0.0003). The weekly rate of days with services showed no obvious differences before and after the switch but had a clear 8‐week pattern (corresponding to the average infusion interval) (Figure). The total number of services provided was 19,752 (2,019 of these on the switch date). There were significant increases in the rates before vs after switch for 6 of the 16 service categories, although the mean rates were small: telephone consultations (mean rate 1.0 before vs. 1.2 after), patient guidance (0.5 vs. 0.4), intravenous medication (0.0 vs. 0.1), clinical controls (2.1 vs. 2.3) and clinical investigations (0.3 vs. 0.5), whereas the rate of infliximab treatment decreased (3.1 vs 3.0) (all p<0.05, insignificant results not shown). Conclusions: This analysis showed that there were only small differences in the rates of days with outpatient services and rates of services 6 months before and after the switch from original to biosimilar infliximab. Thus, it is unlikely that the switch is associated with substantially higher cost of health care resources. (Figure Presented).

AB: BACKGROUND: Phone‐based tobacco cessation program effectiveness has been established and randomized controlled trials have provided some support for Web‐based services. Relatively little is known about who selects different treatment modalities and how they engage with treatments in a real‐world setting. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the characteristics, Web utilization patterns, and return rates of tobacco users who self‐selected into a Web‐based (Web‐Only) versus integrated phone/Web (Phone/Web) cessation program. METHODS: We examined the demographics, baseline tobacco use, Web utilization patterns, and return rates of 141,429 adult tobacco users who self‐selected into a Web‐Only or integrated Phone/Web cessation program through 1 of 10 state quitlines from August 2012 through July 2013. For each state, registrants were only included from the timeframe in which both programs were offered to all enrollees. Utilization data were limited to site interactions occurring within 6 months after registration. RESULTS: Most participants selected the Phone/Web program (113,019/141,429, 79.91%). After enrollment in Web services, Web‐Only were more likely to log in compared to Phone/Web (21,832/28,410, 76.85% vs 23,920/56,892, 42.04%; P<.001), but less likely to return after their initial log‐in (8766/21,832, 40.15% vs 13,966/23,920, 58.39%; P<.001). In bivariate and multivariable analyses, those who chose Web‐Only were younger, healthier, more highly educated, more likely to be uninsured or commercially insured, more likely to be white non‐Hispanic and less likely to be black non‐Hispanic, less likely to be highly nicotine‐addicted, and more likely to have started their program enrollment online (all P<.001). Among both program populations, participants were more likely to return to Web services if they were women, older, more highly educated, or were sent nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) through their quitline (all P<.001). Phone/Web were also more likely to return if they had completed a coaching call, identified as white non‐Hispanic or "other" race, or were commercially insured (all P<.001). Web‐Only were less likely to return if they started their enrollment online versus via phone. The interactive Tobacco Tracker, Cost Savings Calculator, and Quitting Plan were the most widely used features overall. Web‐Only were more likely than Phone/Web to use most key features (all P<.001), most notably the 5 Quitting Plan behaviors. Among quitlines that offered NRT to both Phone/Web and Web‐Only, Web‐Only were less likely to have received quitline NRT. CONCLUSIONS: This paper adds to our understanding of who selects different cessation treatment modalities and how they engage with the program in a real‐world setting. Web‐Only were younger, healthier smokers of higher socioeconomic status who interacted more intensely with services in a single session, but were less likely to re‐engage or access NRT benefits. Further research should examine the efficacy of different engagement techniques and services with different subpopulations of tobacco users.

AB: BACKGROUND: Given the global prevalence of insufficient physical activity (PA), effective interventions that attenuate age‐related decline in PA levels are needed. Mobile phone interventions that positively affect health (mHealth) show promise; however, their impact on PA levels and fitness in young people is unclear and little is known about what makes a good mHealth app. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the effects of two commercially available smartphone apps (Zombies, Run and Get Running) on cardiorespiratory fitness and PA levels in insufficiently active healthy young people. A second aim was to identify the features of the app design that may contribute to improved fitness and PA levels. METHODS: Apps for IMproving FITness (AIMFIT) was a 3‐arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants were recruited through advertisements in electronic mailing lists, local newspapers, flyers posted in community locations, and presentations at schools. Eligible young people aged 14‐17 years were allocated at random to 1 of 3 conditions: (1) use of an immersive app (Zombies, Run), (2) use of a nonimmersive app (Get Running), or (3) usual behavior (control). Both smartphone apps consisted of a fully automated 8‐week training program designed to improve fitness and ability to run 5 km; however, the immersive app featured a game‐themed design and narrative. Intention‐to‐treat analysis was performed using data collected face‐to‐face at baseline and 8 weeks, and all regression models were adjusted for baseline outcome value and gender. The primary outcome was cardiorespiratory fitness, objectively assessed as time to complete the 1‐mile run/walk test at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were PA levels (accelerometry and self‐reported), enjoyment, psychological need satisfaction, self‐efficacy, and acceptability and usability of the apps. RESULTS: A total of 51 participants were randomized to the immersive app intervention (n=17), nonimmersive app intervention (n=16), or the control group (n=18). The mean age of participants was 15.7 (SD 1.2) years; participants were mostly NZ Europeans (61%, 31/51) and 57% (29/51) were female. Overall retention rate was 96% (49/51). There was no significant intervention effect on the primary outcome using either of the apps. Compared to the control, time to complete the fitness test was ‐28.4 seconds shorter (95% CI ‐66.5 to 9.82, P=.20) for the immersive app group and ‐24.7 seconds (95% CI ‐63.5 to 14.2, P=.32) for the nonimmersive app group. No significant intervention effects were found for secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although apps have the ability to increase reach at a low cost, our pragmatic approach using readily available commercial apps as a stand‐alone instrument did not have a significant effect on fitness. However, interest in future use of PA apps is promising and highlights a potentially important role of these tools in a multifaceted approach to increase fitness, promote PA, and consequently reduce the adverse health outcomes associated with insufficient activity.

AB: Introduction: There is no established time, dose, fractionation schedule in High dose rate (HDR)‐Intracavitary Brachytherapy (ICBT) for the treatment of locally advanced carcinoma cervix 1. At our institution these patients are treated with 3 weekly fractions of 7Gy (7Gyx 3#) HDR‐ICBT schedule abiding the recommendation of American Brachytherapy Society. Studies based on X‐ray based point dosimetry have shown that 2 weekly fractions of 9Gy (9Gyx 2#) HDR‐ICBT is safe and effective in terms of local control and toxicity and of particular importance in cost‐constraint setting.Clinical feasibility of HDR‐ICBT using 60Co has been shown previously4. Here, we report a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing dose‐ volume (DVH) parameters tumor response and toxicity in 7 Gyx 3# versus 9 Gyx 2# using CT based 3D treatment planning using 60Co HDR remote afterloading device. Aims and Objective: Comparison of DVH parameters, tumor response and and toxicity between the two arms. Materials and Methods: Between January 2013 to March 2014, 60 eligible locally advanced cervical carcinoma patients were randomized into two arms (30 in each arm) to receive either 7Gyx 3# (Control: Arm A) or 9Gyx 2# (Study: Arm B) after completion of EBRT (50.4Gy/28 fractions in 5.3 weeks) with concurrent weekly cisplatin. During brachytherapy CT scan based contouring and plan optimization was done using 3D treatment planning software. DVH parameters of target i.e. High risk clinical target volume (HRCTV), Intermediate risk clinical target volume (IRCTV) and organ at risk (OAR) i.e. bladder, rectum and sigmoid colon were assessed. Equivalent dose in 2Gray/fraction (EQD2) was calculated summing EBRT and all ICBT doses (considering alpha/beta of tumor and OARs are 10 and 3 respectively). Patients were followed up for tumor response and toxicity. RTOG criteria were used for toxicity scoring. Results: EQD2 D90HRCTV in Arm A (93.99 +/‐ 14.19Gy) and Arm B (100.42 +/‐ 13.75Gy) were comparable (P = 0.108). EQD2 D90IRCTV in Arm A and B are 70.36 +/‐ 8.23Gy and 67.49 +/‐ 5.96 Gy respectively (P = 0.16).EQD2 D2cc bladder was 83.48 +/‐ 9.63Gy and Arm B was 79.50 +/‐ 5.96Gy (P = 0.077). EQD2 D2cc rectum in Arm A was 63.15 +/‐ 4.75Gy and Arm B was 62.56 +/‐ 4.72Gy (P = 0.661). EQD2 D2cc sigmoid colon in Arm A was 67.05 +/‐ 5.13Gy and in Arm B was 65.15 +/‐ 5.81Gy (P = 0.228). Median follow up time in Arm A was 10 months (range 6 to 18 months) and in Arm B was 11 months (range 5 to 15 onths).Complete response (CR) at last follow up in two arms (Arm A vs. Arm B) was 82.6% vs. 85.7%, partial response (PR) was 8.7% vs. 10.7%, stable disease was 4.3% vs. 0% and progressive disease was 4.3% vs. 3.6%. No grade 3 acute hematological, gastrointestinal, skin or genitourinary toxicity was observed in either arm. Late grade 2 proctitis/proctosigmoiditis was 4.3% in Arm A and 10.7% in Arm B (P = 0.617). No late bladder toxicity was noted in either arm. Conclusion: In spite of the small sample size and short follow up duration the study shows that 9Gyx 2# is equivalent to 7Gyx 3# of HDR‐ICBT in terms of DVH parameters, tumor response and toxicity using 60Co HDR source.

AB: Introduction: There is no established time, dose, fractionation schedule in High dose rate (HDR)‐Intracavitary Brachytherapy (ICBT) for the treatment of locally advanced carcinoma cervix1. At our institution these patients are treated with 3 weekly fractions of 7Gy (7Gyx3#) HDR‐ICBT schedule abiding the recommendation of American Brachytherapy Society. Studies based on X‐ray based point dosimetry have shown that 2 weekly fractions of 9Gy (9Gyx2#) HDRICBT is safe and effective in terms of local control and toxicity and of particular importance in cost‐constraint setting.Clinical feasibility of HDR‐ICBT using 60Co has been shown previously4. Here, we report a prospective randomized clinical trial comparing dose‐ volume (DVH) parameters tumor response and toxicity in 7 Gyx3# versus 9 Gyx2# using CT based 3D treatment planning using 60Co HDR remote afterloading device. Aims and Objective: Comparison of DVH parameters, tumor response and and toxicity between the two arms. Materials and Methods: Between January 2013 to March 2014, 60 eligible locally advanced cervical carcinoma patients were randomized into two arms (30 in each arm) to receive either 7Gyx3# (Control: Arm A) or 9Gyx2# (Study:Arm B) after completion of EBRT (50.4Gy/28 fractions in 5.3 weeks) with concurrent weekly cisplatin. During brachytherapy CT scan based contouring and plan optimization was done using 3D treatment planning software. DVH parameters of target i.e. High risk clinical target volume (HRCTV), Intermediate risk clinical target volume (IRCTV) and organ at risk (OAR) i.e. bladder, rectum and sigmoid colon were assessed. Equivalent dose in 2Gray/fraction (EQD2) was calculated summing EBRT and all ICBT doses (considering alpha/beta of tumor and OARs are 10 and 3 respectively). Patients were followed up for tumor response and toxicity. RTOG criteria were used for toxicity scoring. Results: EQD2 D90HRCTV in Arm A (93.99+/‐14.19Gy) and Arm B (100.42+/‐13.75Gy) were comparable (p=0.108). EQD2 D90IRCTV in Arm A and B are 70.36+/‐8.23Gy and 67.49+/‐5.96 Gy respectively (p=0.16).EQD2 D2cc bladder was 83.48+/‐9.63Gy and Arm B was 79.50+/‐5.96Gy (p=0.077). EQD2 D2cc rectum in Arm A was 63.15+/‐4.75Gy and Arm B was 62.56+/‐4.72Gy (p=0.661).EQD2 D2cc sigmoid colon in Arm A was 67.05+/‐5.13Gy and in Arm B was 65.15+/‐5.81Gy (p=0.228). Median follow up time in Arm A was 10 months (range 6 to 18 months) and in Arm B was 11 months (range 5 to 15 onths).Complete response (CR) at last follow up in two arms (Arm A vs. Arm B) was 82.6% vs. 85.7%, partial response (PR) was 8.7% vs. 10.7%, stable disease was 4.3% vs. 0% and progressive disease was 4.3% vs. 3.6%. No grade 3 acute hematological, gastrointestinal, skin or genitourinary toxicity was observed in either arm. Late grade 2 proctitis/proctosigmoiditis was 4.3% in Arm A and 10.7% in Arm B (p=0.617). No late bladder toxicity was noted in either arm. Conclusion: In spite of the small sample size and short follow up duration the study shows that 9Gyx2# is equivalent to 7Gyx3# of HDR‐ICBT in terms of DVH parameters, tumor response and toxicity using 60Co HDR source.

AB: BACKGROUND: Throughout the illness trajectory, women with breast cancer experience issues that are related to physical, emotional, and social adjustment. Despite a general consensus that state‐of‐the‐art treatment for breast cancer should include educational and counseling interventions to reduce illness or treatment‐related symptoms, there are few prospective, theoretically based, phase‐specific randomized, controlled trials that have evaluated the effectiveness of such interventions in promoting adjustment. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to examine the physical, emotional, and social adjustment of women with early‐stage breast cancer who received psychoeducation by videotapes, telephone counseling, or psychoeducation plus telephone counseling as interventions that address the specific needs of women during the diagnostic, postsurgery, adjuvant therapy, and ongoing recovery phases of breast cancer. DESIGN: Primary data from a randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Three major medical centers and one community hospital in New York City. METHODS: A total of 249 patients were randomly assigned to either the control group receiving usual care or to one of the three intervention groups. The interventions were administered at the diagnostic, postsurgery, adjuvant therapy, and ongoing recovery phases. Analyses were based on a mixed model analysis of variance. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES AND MEASUREMENT: Physical adjustment was measured by the side effects incidence and severity subscales of the Breast Cancer Treatment Response Inventory (BCTRI) and the overall health status score of the Self‐Rated Health Subscale of the Multilevel Assessment Instrument. Emotional adjustment was measured using the psychological well‐being subscale of the Profile of Adaptation to Life Clinical Scale and the side effect distress subscale of BCTRI. Social adjustment was measured by the domestic, vocational, and social environments subscales of the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale. FINDINGS: Patients in all groups showed improvement over time in overall health, psychological well‐being, and social adjustment. There were no significant group differences in physical adjustment, as measured by side effect incidence, severity, or overall health. There was poorer emotional adjustment over time in the usual care (control) group as compared to the intervention groups on the measure of side effect distress. For the telephone counseling group, there was a marked decline in psychological well‐being from the adjuvant therapy phase through the ongoing recovery phase. There were no significant group differences in the dimensions of social adjustment. CONCLUSION: The longitudinal design of this study has captured the dynamic process of adjustment to breast cancer, which in some aspects and at various phases has been different for the control and intervention groups. Although patients who received the study interventions improved in adjustment, the overall conclusion regarding physical, emotional, and social adjustment is that usual care, which was the standard of care for women in both the usual care (control) and intervention groups, supported their adjustment to breast cancer, with or without additional interventions. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: The results are important to evidence‐based practice and the determination of the efficacy and cost‐effectiveness of interventions in improving patient outcomes. There is a need to further examine adjustment issues that continue during the ongoing recovery phase. KEY POINTS: Psychoeducation by videotapes and telephone counseling decreased side effect distress and side effect severity and increased psychological well‐being during the adjuvant therapy phase. All patients in the control and intervention groups improved in adjustment. Adjustment issues are still present in the ongoing recovery phase.

AB: STATEMENT OF PROBLEM OR QUESTION (ONE SENTENCE): In an urban academic Internal Medicine practice in Philadelphia, 42% of all patients have BMI (body mass index) >30 kg/m2 and 15% have diabetes mellitus type II. This population demonstrates several previouslystudied barriers to fitness including low self efficacy, low health literacy, and limited disposable income to engage in structured exercise and nutrition instruction. OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAM/INTERVENTION (NO MORE THAN THREE OBJECTIVES): The goal of Fitness Now is to create a supervised low cost exercise program in the waiting room of the clinical practice, centered on partnership between the patient and practice physicians, emphasizing safety. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICSWHICHWILL BEUSED TOEVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): Components of the first pilot included 32 sessions of live exercise class with fitness lesson moderated by a personal trainer and practice physician, pedometer usage, financial incentive, and social support provided by phone and text messages. The majority of patients were referred by their health care provider (n=38), but a few self‐referred after seeing posted fliers in the waiting room (n=10). 41 participants were women, 40 designated their race as black, 18 were diabetic, and all had BMI >28 kg/m2. MEASURES OF SUCCESS (DISCUSS QUALITATIVE AND/OR QUANTITATIVE METRICSWHICHWILL BEUSED TOEVALUATE PROGRAM/INTERVENTION): Of those followed for 16 weeks with post program evaluation, 12 were regular class participants receiving supportive calls and texts, and 18 received calls and texts alone and never participated in a class. There was no difference between these two groups in the following measures taken at the start of the program: mean health rating (3.1 on a 5 point Likert scale), confidence that they would follow through with the class (4.5), or self‐efficacy for exercise (29 out of 50 on a 10‐question validated scale). However, weight loss was larger among those who came to class (‐7.3 (3.0) pounds versus 0.5 (5.5) pounds, p=0.001) and self‐efficacy for exercise in post program evaluation was higher among those who came to class (1.2 (4.0) versus ‐11.2 (8.3), p=0.003). FINDINGS TO DATE (IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO STATE “FINDINGS WILL BE DISCUSSED”): This pilot identified several barriers to exercise and healthy eating in an urban patient population namely compliance, but shows significant short‐term weight loss and increased selfefficacy for exercise when virtual support was coupled with live classes. KEY LESSONS FOR DISSEMINATION (WHAT CAN OTHERS TAKE AWAY FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR PRACTICE OR COMMUNITY?): We demonstrate the importance of motivating healthy behavior change in high‐risk patients in places both real and virtual, outside of the regular office visit. Planned further piloting of the program and a randomized controlled trial is needed to test this intervention on a larger scale with long‐term follow‐up.

AB: Background Recruitment to randomised controlled trials can be challenging, particularly when the burden of participation is high (e.g. long and/or intensive follow‐up), the interventions under evaluation are very different (e.g. surgery versus best medical management) and there are strong preferences amongst clinicians and/or potential participants. To help overcome these challenges, a quintet recruitment intervention (QRI) was developed by Donovan and colleagues in the context of the ProtecT trial. The QRI is a complex intervention with several components. These include detailed assessment of screening logs, in‐depth interviews, audio‐recording of recruitment consultations, and expert review and analysis of the consultations to allow group and individual feedback to recruitment teams on how to optimise informed consent. The impact of the individual elements of the QRI have not been previously explored. The aim of this study is to examine the association between trial recruitment and audio‐recording of consultations. Methods Data from two on‐going "difficult‐to‐recruit to" multi‐centre RCTs in surgery with an integrated QRI were used for this study; one comparing the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of three types of bariatric surgery for severe and complex obesity (By‐Band‐Sleeve) and the other comparing open versus video‐assisted thoracotomy (key hole) surgery for early stage lung cancer (Violet). In both trials, recruiters and eligible participants were invited to have their recruitment consultation audio‐recorded. We examined the rate of consent amongst patients who did and did not agree to audio recording. Results Over the two trials, approximately two‐thirds of eligible patients agreed to their consultation being audio‐recorded (By‐Band‐Sleeve 1209/1806, 67%; Violet 149/185, 80%), with some variation in audio‐consent rates across centres. In both studies the proportion of patients agreeing to randomisation is higher amongst the group who consented to audio‐recording and the pattern is consistent across the two studies (By‐Band‐Sleeve 39% vs 9%, Violet 76% vs 16%). The probability of consenting to randomisation is four‐times higher (risk ratio 4.45, 95% CI 3.2‐6.1) when the consultation is recorded. The overall randomisation rate is 29% in By‐Band‐Sleeve and 50% in Violet. Withdrawal rates following consent are low in both trials (By‐Band‐Sleeve 4%, Violet 6%). We will describe the variation in audio‐consent rates by centre and recruiting surgeon and the impact of QRI feedback on trial recruitment rates. Discussion This is the first study to examine the association between consent for audio‐recording and trial participation. Whilst we have demonstrated an association, the reasons for this are unclear and require further investigation. They may be patient‐related, recruiter‐related, or both. For example, a patient who consents to audio‐recording may be naturally more predisposed to research, or they may feel they should agree to randomisation because the consultation could be listened to (although we have no evidence of coercion). Similarly, recruiters who consent to audio recording may be more comfortable with and better at conducting recruitment consultations. They may also "try harder" to recruit the patient when the consultation is being audio‐recorded. It is important to explore and better understand the factors that might underlie this association to further support trial recruitment.

AB: BACKGROUND: Adoptions of health behaviors are crucial for maintaining good health after type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnoses. However, adherence to glucoregulating behaviors like regular exercise and balanced diet can be challenging, especially for people living in lower‐socioeconomic status (SES) communities. Providing cost‐effective interventions that improve self‐management is important for improving quality of life and the sustainability of health care systems. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a health coach intervention with and without the use of mobile phones to support health behavior change in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In this noninferiority, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT), patients from two primary care health centers in Toronto, Canada, with type 2 diabetes and a glycated hemoglobin/hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of ≥7.3% (56.3 mmol/mol) were randomized to receive 6 months of health coaching with or without mobile phone monitoring support. We hypothesized that both approaches would result in significant HbA1c reductions, although health coaching with mobile phone monitoring would result in significantly larger effects. Participants were evaluated at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c from baseline to 6 months (difference between and within groups). Other outcomes included weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), satisfaction with life, depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), positive and negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS]), and quality of life (Short Form Health Survey‐12 [SF‐12]). RESULTS: A total of 138 patients were randomized and 7 were excluded for a substudy; of the remaining 131, 67 were allocated to the intervention group and 64 to the control group. Primary outcome data were available for 97 participants (74.0%). While both groups reduced their HbA1c levels, there were no significant between‐group differences in change of HbA1c at 6 months using intention‐to‐treat (last observation carried forward [LOCF]) (P=.48) or per‐protocol (P=.83) principles. However, the intervention group did achieve an accelerated HbA1c reduction, leading to a significant between‐group difference at 3 months (P=.03). This difference was reduced at the 6‐month follow‐up as the control group continued to improve, achieving a reduction of 0.81% (8.9 mmol/mol) (P=.001) compared with a reduction of 0.84% (9.2 mmol/mol)(P=.001) in the intervention group. Intervention group participants also had significant decreases in weight (P=.006) and waist circumference (P=.01) while controls did not. Both groups reported improvements in mood, satisfaction with life, and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Health coaching with and without access to mobile technology appeared to improve glucoregulation and mental health in a lower‐SES, T2DM population. The accelerated improvement in the mobile phone group suggests the connectivity provided may more quickly improve adoption and adherence to health behaviors within a clinical diabetes management program. Overall, health coaching in primary care appears to lead to significant benefits for patients from lower‐SES communities with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.

AB: Background: A TKA is the most effective and cost‐effective surgical option for moderate to severe osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Yet, black patients are less willing to undergo knee replacement surgery than white patients. Decision aids help people understand treatment options and consider the personal importance of possible benefits and harms of treatments, including TKA. Questions/purposes: We asked: (1) Does a patient‐centered intervention consisting of a decision aid for knee OA and motivational interviewing improve the proportion of referrals of blacks with knee OA to orthopaedic surgery? (2) Does the intervention increase patients' willingness to undergo TKA? Methods: Adults who self‐identified as black who were at least 50 years old with moderate to severe knee OA were enrolled from urban primary care clinics in a two‐group randomized, controlled trial. A total of 1253 patients were screened for eligibility, and 760 were excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria, declining to participate, or other reasons. Four hundred ninety‐three patients were randomized and completed the intervention; three had missing referral data at followup. The mean age of the patients was 61 years, and 51% were women. The majority had an annual household income less than USD 15,000. Participants in the treatment group were shown a decision‐aid video and had a brief session with a trained counselor in motivational interviewing. Participants in the control group received an educational booklet about OA that did not mention joint replacement. The two groups had comparable demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The primary outcome was referral to orthopaedic surgery 12 months after treatment exposure. Receipt of referral was defined as the receipt of a recommendation or prescription from a primary care provider for orthopaedic evaluation. The secondary outcome was change in patient willingness to undergo TKA based on patient self‐report. Results: The odds of receiving a referral to orthopaedic surgery did not differ between the two study groups (36%, 90 of 253 of the control group; 32%, 76 of 240 of the treatment group; odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.56‐1.18; p = 0.277). At 2 weeks followup, there was no difference between the treatment and the control groups in terms of increased willingness to consider TKA relative to baseline (34%, 67 of 200 patients in the treatment group; 33%, 68 of 208 patients in the control group; OR, 1.06; p = 0.779). At 12 months followup, the percent increase in willingness to undergo TKA still did not differ between patients in the treatment and control groups (29%, 49 of 174 in the treatment group; 27%, 51 of 191 in the control group; OR, 1.10; p = 0.679). Conclusion: A combination decision aid and motivational interviewing strategy was no better than an educational pamphlet in improving patients' preferences toward joint replacement surgery for knee OA. The type of intervention treatment also did not affect access to surgical evaluation. Other tools that target patient knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes regarding surgical treatments for OA may be further developed and tested in the future. Level of Evidence: Level I, therapeutic study.

AB: Nearly 400,000 people living in the United States suffer with end stage renal disease; of these, approximately 84,000 are currently awaiting kidney transplantation [1, 2]. Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for eligible patients with end stage renal disease. Kidney transplantation has been shown to offer superior quality of life, improved life expectancy, and better psychosocial functioning, all at less cost than maintenance hemodialysis [3‐6]. Despite numerous advances in the medical and surgical care of transplant recipients, significant improvements in long‐term graft survival have not been realized. The current 3‐year graft survival rate is only 81% [2] and graft half‐life is only ∼9 years [7]. Remediable factors like poor medication adherence and poor control of comorbid medical conditions negatively impact kidney transplantation outcomes [8‐13]. Non‐adherence to prescribed medical regimens has been identified as a primary risk factor for graft rejection, graft loss, and death [14‐18]. Even in the absence of rejection, non‐adherent patients suffer a more rapid loss of renal function over time [17]. While the risk with non‐adherence is a continuum, even very small degrees of non‐adherence confer a significantly increased risk of graft rejection or graft loss [16, 18]. In a recent meta‐analysis, researchers found approximately 35% of American kidney recipients demonstrate non‐adherent behavior post‐transplant [19]. Non‐adherence to medication regimens has been shown to develop within just a few weeks of transplantation and its early development increases the risk for persistent poor adherence [16]. Although medication adherence is critical for optimal kidney transplant outcomes, there is a dearth of research examining interventions directed at improving adherence. A recent review of medication non‐adherence studies performed in solid organ transplant recipients identified only 12 studies, 7 of which involved kidney transplant recipients [20]. Intervention approaches included patient or primary care provider education and patient‐focused motivational, behavioral or psychological/affective state change. Less than half of the studies observed a significant improvement in adherence to a single medication. Adherence was often evaluated based upon selfreport and/or medication possession ratio. None of these approaches were completely successful in reaching desired adherence levels. We briefiy describe the results of a proof‐of‐concept randomized controlled trial (RCT) utilizing a prototype mobile health (mHealth) system in renal transplant recipients with hypertension. The aims of this study were threefold. First, to assess patient and provider acceptability (recruitment and participation rates) and adherence to the protocols; second, to assess the feasibility of using our mHealth system to monitor and enhance medication adherence and BP control; and third, to obtain estimates of variability for the outcome measures and to obtain preliminary indicators of treatment effectiveness, as necessary input for design of a future efficacy/effectiveness RCT.

AB: BACKGROUND: Mobile technology has the potential to deliver behavior change interventions (mHealth) to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) at modest cost. Previous studies have focused on single behaviors; however, cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a component of CHD self‐management, needs to address multiple risk factors. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the effectiveness of a mHealth‐delivered comprehensive CR program (Text4Heart) to improve adherence to recommended lifestyle behaviors (smoking cessation, physical activity, healthy diet, and nonharmful alcohol use) in addition to usual care (traditional CR). METHODS: A 2‐arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial was conducted in New Zealand adults diagnosed with CHD. Participants were recruited in‐hospital and were encouraged to attend center‐based CR (usual care control). In addition, the intervention group received a personalized 24‐week mHealth program, framed in social cognitive theory, sent by fully automated daily short message service (SMS) text messages and a supporting website. The primary outcome was adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors measured using a self‐reported composite health behavior score (≥3) at 3 and 6 months. Secondary outcomes included clinical outcomes, medication adherence score, self‐efficacy, illness perceptions, and anxiety and/or depression at 6 months. Baseline and 6‐month follow‐up assessments (unblinded) were conducted in person. RESULTS: Eligible patients (N=123) recruited from 2 large metropolitan hospitals were randomized to the intervention (n=61) or the control (n=62) group. Participants were predominantly male (100/123, 81.3%), New Zealand European (73/123, 59.3%), with a mean age of 59.5 (SD 11.1) years. A significant treatment effect in favor of the intervention was observed for the primary outcome at 3 months (AOR 2.55, 95% CI 1.12‐5.84; P=.03), but not at 6 months (AOR 1.93, 95% CI 0.83‐4.53; P=.13). The intervention group reported significantly greater medication adherence score (mean difference: 0.58, 95% CI 0.19‐0.97; P=.004). The majority of intervention participants reported reading all their text messages (52/61, 85%). The number of visits to the website per person ranged from zero to 100 (median 3) over the 6‐month intervention period. CONCLUSIONS: A mHealth CR intervention plus usual care showed a positive effect on adherence to multiple lifestyle behavior changes at 3 months in New Zealand adults with CHD compared to usual care alone. The effect was not sustained to the end of the 6‐month intervention. A larger study is needed to determine the size of the effect in the longer term and whether the change in behavior reduces adverse cardiovascular events.

AB: BACKGROUND: Childhood eczema, or childhood atopic dermatitis, causes significant distress to children and their families through sleep disturbance and itch. The main cause of treatment failure is nonuse of prescribed treatments. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop and test a Web‐based intervention to support families of children with eczema, and to explore whether support from a health care professional (HCP) is necessary to engage participants with the intervention. METHODS: We followed the PRECEDE‐PROCEED model: regular emollient use was the target behavior we were seeking to promote and we identified potential techniques to influence this. LifeGuide software was used to write the intervention website. Carers of children with eczema were invited through primary care mail‐out and randomized to 3 groups: (1) website only, (2) website plus HCP support, or (3) usual care. Patient‐Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) scores were measured online by carer report at baseline and at 12 weeks. Qualitative interviews were carried out with 13 HCPs (primarily practice nurses) and 26 participants to explore their experiences of taking part in the study. RESULTS: A total of 143 carers were recruited through 31 practices. We found a decrease of ≥2 in follow‐up compared with baseline POEM score in 23 of 42 (55%) participants in the website only group, 16 of 49 (33%) in the usual care group, and 18 of 47 (38%) in the website plus HCP group. Website use data showed that 75 of 93 (81%) participants allocated to the website groups completed the core modules, but less than half used other key components (videos: 35%; regular text reminders: 39%). There were no consistent differences in website use between the website only or the website plus HCP groups. Qualitative feedback showed that most HCPs had initial concerns about providing support for eczema self‐care because this was not a condition that they felt expert in. However, HCPs reported productive consultations and that they found it helpful to use the website in consultations, while observing that some participants seemed to need more support than others. Qualitative interviews with participants suggested that HCP support was valued highly only by a minority, generally those who were less confident in their management of eczema or less confident using the Internet. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot trial demonstrated the potential for greater improvements in POEM scores in both website intervention groups and that a full‐scale trial is feasible. Such a trial would quantify the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of this intervention to determine whether it should be widely promoted to families of children with newly diagnosed eczema. In this study population, HCP support was not strongly valued by participants and did not lead to better outcomes or website use than use of the Web‐based intervention alone.

AB: Introduction: In Navarra colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the highest incidence of cancer, the second cause of cancer mortality in men and the first in women. This implies an important public health problem, which justifies the development of control strategies. Moreover, various studies demonstrate that CRC screening programmes are cost‐effective, and a determining factor for the successful of them is the participation rate and the adherence. Aims & Methods: The aim of this study was to assess the global participation, from the invitation until the confirmatory diagnostic procedure during the first fifteen months of the colorectal cancer screening programme in Navarra, started in 2013 and based on a quantitative immunochemical fecal occult blood (i‐ FOBT). The following indicators were analyzed:. 1. Target population: people born between 1.1.1944 and 31.12.1964, who reside in Navarra. 2. Exclusion criteria: colonoscopy performed in the previous 5 years, previous diagnosis of CRC, follow‐up colonoscopies because of colon disease and severe illness that involves a contraindication for the participation. 3. Invited population: people who have received an invitation to participate in the CRC screening programme during the first fifteen months. 4. Acceptance: expression of their willingness to participate. 5. Participation: number of people who provide their i‐FOBT sample. The reasons for non‐participation were collected through randomized telephone interviews (n=250). 6. Rate of referral for follow‐up confirmatory diagnostic procedure (colonoscopy or virtual colonoscopy) after a positive i‐FOBT. Results: Firstly, 10, 664 people were excluded following the criteria described above from our target population (160, 000). Invited population during the first fifteen months was composed of 46, 189 people. However, 31, 107 expressed their willingness to participate and 26.752 (65.29%) provided their i‐FOBT (66.97% for women and 63.41% for invited men). The most frequent reasons for non‐participation were laziness and lack of time (30%), and also lack of risk of disease perception (26%). In total, 1914 people had a positive i‐FOBT and 36 (1.9%) of them refused to continue with the confirmatory diagnostic procedure. In this period, 1145 people had followed‐up confirmatory diagnostic procedure, 1244 colonoscopies and 25 virtual colonoscopies were performed. Conclusion: We have obtained a high rate of acceptance and participation in the colorectal cancer screening programme in Navarra with a participation rate (PR) of 65.29% and also an acceptance rate of follow‐up confirmatory diagnostic procedure of 98.1%. Both values exceed quality indicators and recommended standards of the European guidelines. (1) It is important to highlight that our programme participation rate is one of the highest in Spain (PR: 21% ‐ 64.3%) and in Europe (7 ‐ 67.7%), with similar rates to the Basque Country (PR: 64.3%) and Finland (PR: 67.7%) programmes. (2) To conclude, further studies are required for assessing the factors that have most significant influence in the PR of the CRC screening programmes. Nevertheless, the important lack of risk of disease perception in the non‐participation group from our target population is an issue to be analyzed and addressed.

DOI: 10.2196/jmir.2283
AB: BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in the use of information communication technologies to treat obesity. An intervention delivered by smartphone could be a convenient, potentially cost‐effective, and wide‐reaching weight management strategy. Although there have been studies of texting‐based interventions and smartphone applications (apps) used as adjuncts to other treatments, there are currently no randomized controlled trials (RCT) of a stand‐alone smartphone application for weight loss that focuses primarily on self‐monitoring of diet and physical activity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to collect acceptability and feasibility outcomes of a self‐monitoring weight management intervention delivered by a smartphone app, compared to a website and paper diary. METHODS: A sample of 128 overweight volunteers were randomized to receive a weight management intervention delivered by smartphone app, website, or paper diary. The smartphone app intervention, My Meal Mate (MMM), was developed by the research team using an evidence‐based behavioral approach. The app incorporates goal setting, self‐monitoring of diet and activity, and feedback via weekly text message. The website group used an existing commercially available slimming website from a company called Weight Loss Resources who also provided the paper diaries. The comparator groups delivered a similar self‐monitoring intervention to the app, but by different modes of delivery. Participants were recruited by email, intranet, newsletters, and posters from large local employers. Trial duration was 6 months. The intervention and comparator groups were self‐directed with no ongoing human input from the research team. The only face‐to‐face components were at baseline enrollment and brief follow‐up sessions at 6 weeks and 6 months to take anthropometric measures and administer questionnaires. RESULTS: Trial retention was 40/43 (93%) in the smartphone group, 19/42 (55%) in the website group, and 20/43 (53%) in the diary group at 6 months. Adherence was statistically significantly higher in the smartphone group with a mean of 92 days (SD 67) of dietary recording compared with 35 days (SD 44) in the website group and 29 days (SD 39) in the diary group (P<.001). Self‐monitoring declined over time in all groups. In an intention‐to‐treat analysis using baseline observation carried forward for missing data, mean weight change at 6 months was ‐4.6 kg (95% CI ‐6.2 to ‐3.0) in the smartphone app group, ‐2.9 kg (95% CI ‐4.7 to ‐1.1) in the diary group, and ‐1.3 kg (95% CI ‐2.7 to 0.1) in the website group. BMI change at 6 months was ‐1.6 kg/m(2) (95% CI ‐2.2 to ‐1.1) in the smartphone group, ‐1.0 kg/m(2) (95% CI ‐1.6 to ‐0.4) in the diary group, and ‐0.5 kg/m(2) (95% CI ‐0.9 to 0.0) in the website group. Change in body fat was ‐1.3% (95% CI ‐1.7 to ‐0.8) in the smartphone group, ‐0.9% (95% CI ‐1.5 to ‐0.4) in the diary group, and ‐0.5% (95% CI ‐0.9 to 0.0) in the website group. CONCLUSIONS: The MMM app is an acceptable and feasible weight loss intervention and a full RCT of this approach is warranted.

KY: Acute Coronary Syndrome; Infarction; Myocardial Infarction; Ventricular Remodeling
AB: Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) accounts for more than 6,000 admissions to Singapore hospitals each year. Contemporary treatment, including percutaneous intervention (angioplasty and stenting) and adjunctive drug therapy, has reduced early mortality from AMI. In many healthcare systems, Hospital scorecards stipulate prescription of appropriate drugs upon discharge after hospitalization for AMI. These drugs include aspirin, a platelet P2Y12 inhibitor, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE‐I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta‐blockers and lipid‐lowering drugs. Such quality improvement programs have led to an increase in prescription of these drugs upon discharge. Yet, 2 problems remain pervasive: 1. dose optimization; how the investigators escalate patients to the most effective drug doses, and 2. drug adherence; whether patients are taking these drugs regularly. These 2 problems stem largely from the traditional model of episodic care entailing face‐to‐face visits between patient and healthcare practitioner. Inadequate dose optimization is most relevant to ACE‐I/ARB and beta‐blockers as healthcare practitioners necessarily prescribe low doses of these drugs at discharge to avoid excessive lowering of blood pressure soon after an AMI. Yet, these drugs are most effective at preventing adverse ventricular remodeling when patients take them at their maximum tolerated doses. In clinical trials, titrating these ACE‐I/ARB and beta‐blockers to target doses has required weekly outpatient visits, a model of care that most healthcare systems cannot afford. The investigators hypothesize that a telemedicine‐based system of care will lead to a greater reduction in ventricular remodeling as compared with usual care, by improving dose optimization and adherence to ACE‐I/ARB and beta‐blockers in patients with recent AMI. Participants with AMI (n=300) will be recruited during the index hospitalization. A key inclusion criteria is an elevated NT‐proBNP measurement during the index hospitalization. Participants will first undergo stratified randomization according to ST‐segment classification (STEMI/NSTEMI), thereafter randomized into the Telehealth versus Control group in 1:1 sequential block randomization (blocks of 4 and 6). The telehealth intervention group will have their blood pressure and heart rate monitored twice daily at home for 2 months, with alternating titration between ACE‐inhibitors and betablockers weekly during the first 2 months. After 2 months, they will continue on telemedicine consultation for 4 months; coaching on drug adherence, drug side‐effects management and monitoring of symptoms. A smartphone‐based app developed by PEACH Intellihealth will provide structured health education, medication reminders and real‐time text messaging with telehealth professionals. All participants enrolled will be put on 1 year of dual antiplatelet therapy, have a cardiac MRI done both at baseline and 6‐months, and followed up with cardiologist review visit at 1, 6 and 12 months. Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events will be assessed during each cardiologist review visit, and beyond 12 months, it will be assessed by either phone calls or online/mailed questionnaires at 18 and 24 months. Four substudies have been planned: a substudy to assess the impact of telemedicine on readmissions (ALTRA), a substudy to assess the effect of telemedicine on adherence to antiplatelet therapy (TICA), a substudy to assess the cost‐effectiveness of telemedicine (CEA) and a substudy to assess the effect of telemedicine on MR‐PET measured cardiac work efficiency (CES).

AB: Background: Paediatric patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) face a life of repeated hospitalisations and frequent outpatient visits, which may affect social activities and increase absence from school and potentially reduce educational possibilities. Our aim was to optimise care by a novel telemedicine application and thereby allocating the patients' time and hospital resources to periods of active disease. Methods: IBD patients 10‐17 years were prospectively randomised to an open‐label case‐control telemedicine intervention for 2 years with an inclusion period of 8 months. Patients in the telemedicine (web) group used the web‐application young.constant‐care.com, in which the disease burden was estimated by a patient‐reported symptom score and faecal calprotectin (FC). The IBD‐care team monitored the patients by weekly web‐rounds and beside one annual preplanned visit, further outpatient visits were scheduled on demand in case of increased disease burden. The control group continued standard care by outpatient visit every third month including FC. Results: In the study, 53 patients (32 ulcerative colitis [UC], 21 Crohn's Disease [CD]) were included (27 web, 26 control); median duration of participations: web 86 weeks (IQR 36), control 92 weeks (IQR 20). Adherence using the telemedicine programme was 80% (total 355 actual of 444 expected entries). Numbers of on demand outpatient visits in addition to the annual visit in the web group and the quarterly visits in the control group showed no difference; mean web 1,6 (SEM 0,5 CI 95% 0.6;2.5) mean control 1.4 (SEM 0,4 CI 95% 0.6;2.1). Numbers of total outpatient visits were 74 (2.7 per patient) in the web and 172(6.6 per patient) in the control group. This difference reflects a total outpatient‐cost difference in Denmark of 10 022 Euro. No difference was found in time to first on demand visit and time to step‐up in treatment intensity. Numbers of hospitalisations in the web group were 1 (in total 5 days) versus 7 (in total 18 days distributed at 5 patients) in the control group (no significant difference). No differences were observed regarding extra doctor and nurse telephone call or nurse consultations. Significant difference was observed in number of IBD‐related absence days from school between the web (mean 1.4 days per patient, SEM 0.5) and control group (mean 15.7 days per patient, SEM 4.5 p = 0.002). Conclusions: Telemedicine in children and adolescence with IBD reduces the number of needed outpatient visit and hospitalisations without increasing the risk of step‐up in medical treatment. Further, the web group had significant lower IBD‐related absence days from school.

AB: Objectives: To summarize the ongoing Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by Vitamin E and Selenium (PREADViSE) trial as an ancillary study to SELECT (a large prostate cancer prevention trial) and to present the blinded results of the first year as an exposure study. Design: PREADViSE was designed as a double blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). Setting: SELECT terminated after median of 5.5 years of exposure to supplements due to a futility analysis. Both trials then converted into an exposure study. Participants: In the randomized component PREADViSE enrolled 7,547 men age 62 or older (60 if African American). Once the trial terminated 4,246 of these men volunteered for the exposure study. Demographics were similar for both groups with exposure volunteers having baseline mean age 67.3 ± 5.2 years, 15.3 ± 2.4 years of education, 9.8% African Americans, and 22.0% reporting a family history of dementia. Intervention: In the RCT men were randomly assigned to either daily doses of 400 IU of vitamin E or placebo and 200 μg of selenium or placebo using a 2x2 factorial structure. Measurements: In the RCT, participants completed the Memory Impairment Screen (MIS), and if they failed, underwent a longer screening (based on an expanded Consortium to Establish a Registry in AD [CERAD] battery). CERAD failure resulted in visits to their clinician for medical examination with records of these examinations forwarded to the PREADViSE center for further review. In the exposure study, men are contacted by telephone and complete the telephone version of the memory impairment screen (MIS‐T) screen. If they fail the MIS‐T, a Modified Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS‐M) exam is given. A failed TICS‐M exam also leads to a visit to their clinician for an in‐depth examination and forwarding of records for a centralized consensus diagnosis by expert clinicians. A subgroup of the men who pass the MIS‐T also take the TICS‐M exam for validation purposes. Results: While this ancillary trial was open to all 427 SELECT clinical sites, only 130 (30.0%) of the sites chose to participate in PREADViSE. Staff turnover at the sites presented challenges when training persons unfamiliar with cognitive testing procedures to conduct the memory screens. In the RCT few participants (1.6%) failed the MIS screen and among those who passed this screen a significant practice effect was encountered. In the exposure study 3,581 men were reached by phone in year 1, 15.7% could not be reached after 5 calls, and of those contacted 6.0% refused the screen even after consenting to the procedures at their clinical site. Most notable is that the failure rate for the MIS‐T increased fourfold to 7.2%. Of the 257 men who took the TICS‐M, 84.0% failed and were asked to contact their physicians for a more detailed memory assessment, and approximately half of these had some form of dementia or cognitive impairment. Several of these dementia cases are not AD. Conclusion: Partnering with SELECT led to an AD prevention trial conducted at a very reasonable cost by taking advantage of the experience and efficient clinical trial management found in a cancer cooperative group (Southwest Oncology Group or SWOG). Once unblinded, the RCT and exposure study data have the potential to yield new information on long term exposure to antioxidant supplements under controlled conditions. © 2012 Serdi and Springer Verlag France.

AB: BACKGROUND Telemedicine seems to offer reliable solutions to recent health challenges, but contradictory results were recently found (Hall, Ann Intern Med 2012). Consequently, it is crucial to carefully select outcomes and target patients. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy compliance is essential to treat patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). We believe that OSA patients could have greater benefit from a telemedicine approach for CPAP therapy management. Our aim was to evaluate the application of a new Internet‐based strategy for the CPAP therapy follow‐up of OSA patients. METHODS In a multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) we have compared two groups of recently diagnosed OSA patients receiving face‐to‐face vs. Internet‐based CPAP follow‐up, in which the follow‐up is supported by the use of a web platform previously developed and validated by our group (Isetta, ERS 2011 and ATS 2102) and follow‐up visits are performed via videoconference. Both groups answer periodical questionnaires about symptoms, sleep quality, CPAP side effects, physical activity and body weight and have two follow‐up visits at first and third month. The Internet‐based group is monitored through the web platform, where continuously updated patients' data are represented in a graphical format. At the end of the study (6 months), CPAP therapy compliance, quality of life and cost‐effectiveness will be assessed. RESULTS Main differences between patients excluded (N=100) and included (N=128) were age (56.4±13.0 vs. 48.8±10.0 years; p<0.001) and graduate education level (7% vs. 26%; p<0.001). We found no significant differences in AHI (46.9±23.5 vs. 50.7±27.4 p=0.406) and Epworth (10.3±5.0 vs. 10.8±4.5 p=0.512). At 3 months both groups reported improvement in sleepiness and nasal congestion compared to basal situation, while Body Mass Index (BMI) remained unchanged. Among patients of face‐to‐face group 15.6% had at least one extra visit with a physician, beyond the two follow‐up visits scheduled in the trial, compared to 16.1% of Internet‐based group (p=1). In addition, 15.6% of face‐to‐face group patients had at least an extra visit with a nurse, compared to 25.8% of Internet group (p=0.359). CONCLUSIONS Major differences between included and excluded populations were age and education level. At 3 months face‐to‐face and Internet‐based follow‐up showed similar results in: self‐reported sleepiness, nasal congestion, BMI and extra visits. These results suggest that a telemedicine‐based strategy can be as effective as the standard face‐to‐face approach in OSA patients' management. The final results of our study together with further large RCT studies will build evidence of its clinical impact.

KY: Methotrexate; Psoriasis
AB: Introduction: Methotrexate is one of the oldest and most commonly used systemic drugs for the treatment of psoriasis.[1] Even with the advent of other treatment modalities like systemic retinoids and biologics, methotrexate remains a popular modality for treatment of psoriasis owing to its cost‐effectiveness, ease of administration and greater experience among practitioners regarding its use.[2] Despite long‐term experience in the use of methotrexate in psoriasis, robust evidence and consensus regarding the ideal dosing schedule and route of administration is still lacking.[3] Oral route of methotrexate has been found to have unpredictable and non‐linear bioavailability especially at doses greater than 15 mg/kg.[4] Subcutaneous route of methotrexate on the other hand is associated with better and more linear bioavailability at higher doses.4 Methotrexate by subcutaneous route has also been known to better tolerability and lesser gastrointestinal side effects as compared to oral route. [5] Recently conducted METOP study, which was a randomized controlled study comparing subcutaneous route of methotrexate administration and placebo in control of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis concluded that subcutaneous methotrexate is an efficient and safe modality of treatment of psoriasis. The study also suggested that the pace and longevity of response by subcutaneous route of methotrexate administration may be better than seen with oral route.[6] A recent retrospective study also concluded that subcutaneous route of methotrexate is an effective modality of treatment in patients of psoriasis who have failed oral methotrexate.[7] This study will be the first randomized controlled trial comparing oral versus subcutaneous route of administration of methotrexate in its efficacy in clearance of psoriasis and side effect profile. The study will help in clarification of dilemma of clinicians regarding the ideal route of administration of methotrexate in psoriasis. It will also further strengthen the evidence regarding the adverse effects and tolerability of subcutaneous route of methotrexate administration. Methodology: Aim of the study : To compare the effectiveness and safety profile of oral versus subcutaneous route of administration of methotrexate in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. This study will be an intention to treat single blinded randomized controlled trial. The participants will be patients with moderate to severe psoriasis fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria . They will be randomly allocated to the two treatment arms in the beginning of the study. Participants in one treatment arm will receive methotrexate by oral route while participants in second treatment arm will receive methotrexate by subcutaneous route. Baseline PASI, percentage of body surface area involvement(BSA) and DLQI will be calculated for each patient at the start of study. Any systemic treatment will be stopped for a duration of at least 5 times their half lives before the start of methotrexate in each patient. The participants in first treatment arm will receive 0.3 mg/kg (upto a maximum of 25 mg/week ) of weekly oral methotrexate for 12 weeks or achievement of PASI 90 whichever is earlier while the patients in second treatment arm will receive subcutaneous methotrexate at 0.3 mg/kg/week for the same duration. The participants will be followed at regular intervals and monitored adequately for hematological, hepatotoxic and other adverse effects both clinically and through laboratory investigations according to methotrexate consensus guidelines during the treatment period. PASI, Body surface area (BSA) involvement and DLQI will be assessed at each follow up visit and at the end of 12 weeks. The treatment will be tapered at the rate of 5 mg/2 weeks and stopped after 12 weeks or achievement of PASI 90 whichever is earlier. The participants will be followed up for a period of 24 weeks after stopping methotrexate to observe the relapse free period. Monitoring of the adverse effects: Participants will be monitored for documented side effects of methotrexate at each follow up visit through history, clinical examination and laboratory investigations. The severity of adverse effects will be documented and decision regarding continuation and discontinuation of treatment will be taken as per the participant's will and guidelines. Primary objectives 1. To compare the effectiveness of oral versus subcutaneous route of administration of methotrexate in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. 2. To compare the safety profile of oral versus subcutaneous methotrexate. Secondary objectives 1. Comparison between patients of both treatment arms with respect to time for achieving PASI 90 or PASI 100 2. Comparison between patients of both treatment arms in percentage of patients who achieve PASI 90 by the end of week 12 of treatment. 3. Comparison of improvement in DLQI between patients of both treatment arms. 4. Comparison of the relapse free period after stopping treatment. Project schedule: Screening and Patient recruitment: February 2018 to February 2019, Patient treatment and follow up: March 2018 to August 2018, Compilation of data: September 2019, Statistical analysis and Manuscript: October 2019. Sample size and statistical analysis: A total of 100 participants will be recruited in the study with 50 participants in each treatment arm. Independent ‐sample t‐test will be used to compare group means in percentage decrease in PASI and percentage of patients developing adverse effects. Chi‐square test will be used for qualitative variables. P value less than 0.05 will be considered significant. Ethical Justification: Informed consent will be obtained from each participant prior to recruitment in both the phases of study. Participants will be explained regarding both the arms of the study. The participants will have the right to withdraw without having to give reasons for doing so. Their refusal to participate in the study will not influence their future follow up with the institution in any way. Methotrexate is the most commonly used systemic drug both in its oral and subcutaneous forms in the psoriasis clinic of investigator's institution and overall experience has suggested that it is an effective and safe drug. Monitoring of participants will be done by standard methotrexate consensus guidelines and treatment will be stopped if serious or intolerable adverse effects develop. The investigators have also gathered sufficient experience regarding the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous route of methotrexate, especially in patients who have compliance issues or who have failed oral route or developed intolerable gastrointestinal adverse effects. This study will be the first randomized controlled trial comparing oral versus subcutaneous route of administration of methotrexate in its efficacy in clearance of psoriasis and side effect profile. This study will help in clarification of dilemma of clinicians regarding the ideal route of administration of methotrexate in psoriasis with respect to effectiveness and tolerability. Subcutaneous route of methotrexate administration if found having better effectiveness and tolerability, can be tried first in patients who are failing or not tolerating oral methotrexate before switching to other modalities like retinoids and biologics. Subcutaneous methotrexate being cheaper than biologics and retinoids will also decrease the financial burden on psoriasis patients. Cost‐effectiveness of subcutaneous methotrexate will be a major advantage for developing countries like India where most of the patients cannot afford retinoids or biologics. The ease of administration, availability and accessibility of subcutaneous methotrexate is also better than modalities like biologics and phototherapy in developing countries , especially in remote areas.

AB: INTERVENTION: Based on the malaria endemicity as identified by Vector Borne Disease Control (VBDC) Programme and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Bago Division, villages in the highest malaria endemic areas (“Stratum 1a”) will be selected. Inaccessible villages and villages with less than 70 households will be excluded. High travel cost may also be the reason for exclusion. Selected villages before randomization will include Baw Nat Kyi, Chin Su, Nat Set, Wa Paing, Wun Kite Sho in Bago township, Baya Ngot To, Chin Su‐Daik U, Gway Pin Kuu, Myo Yoe, Pyin Taung Twin, Shwe Nyaung Pin, Taung Thar, Tha Htay Gone villages in Daik U township, Chaung Saut, Moe Ma Kha, Myo Chaung, Nyaung Pin Tha, Pay Kone, Tha Htay Gyi and Than Pa Yar Khone in Kyauk Taga township, Gyo Gone, Koe Gwa, Kyet Tet Nyaung Pin, Sa Pa Kyi, Shwe Laung, Thar Yar Gone, Thaung Tan villages in Oak Twin township, Htone Bo, Kaya Pyone Chaung, Kyauk Pa Toe, Ma U Taw Gyu Zaung, Ta Pyae and Ye Owe Sin villages in Taungoo township, Dauk Inn Gone, Khin Tann, Na Jat, Pa Dauk Kone, Thae Kaw, Thaung Kyi and Thit Cha Seit villages in Ye Dar Shay township. Of these, 20 villages will be randomly selected to select and train a community volunteer each. We will conduct training of community volunteers on the use of malaria rapid diagnostic test (Paracheck Pf) for diagnosis of malaria and treatment with artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) in remote villages where there is no health staff employed. Malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is available as an easy tool for diagnosis of malaria for lay people after receiving job aid plus training for a short duration(Harvey, 2008). It detects specific antigen (protein) produced by malaria parasite in the blood of infected or recently infected people. The recommended sensitivity is 95% or more at 100 or more parasites/microlitre for P.falciparum (World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific, 2004). Training for use of RDT indicates that RDTs are comparable to field microscopes in rural settings, cost‐effective and needs a job aid plus training for 3 hours duration with the available WHO training materials on proper RDT use (The Quality Assurance Project and the World Health Organization, 2006). Paracheck Pf manufactured by Orchid Biomedical Systems, Goa, India (registered trademark) is appropriate for malaria areas with P.falciparum infection and it detects only Plasmodium falciparum by histidine‐rich protein‐2 (HRP2). Coartem (artemether 20 mg/lumefantrine 120 mg) is an artemisinin‐based combination therapy (ACT) indicated for the treatment of acute uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria, the most dangerous form of the disease. Coartem is produced by the Swiss pharmaceutical company, Novartis. Coartem is a highly effective and well‐tolerated malaria treatment, providing cure rates of up to 97%, even in areas of multi‐drug resistance. Coartem is approved in over 80 countries worldwide, including various countries in Africa, as well as by stringent regulatory authorities including Swissmedic, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The number of tablets of Coartem in strips presentation differs by age group and body weight in kilogram. On the strip, a simple instruction is written for tablets to be taken orally twice a day for three days. Chloroquine is a recommended treatment for non‐falciparum malaria in Myanmar. The dose for adult is 4 tablets on the first day, 4 tablets on the second day and 2 on the third day. Volunteers’ training will be conducted in Bago Divisional Health Office. Volunteers from 6 townships (Bago, Daik U, Kyauk Taga, OaK Twin, Taungoo and Ye Dar Shay) will be trained for two days with practical demonstration and exercise by local malaria supervisors and laboratory technician of Bago Vector Borne Disease Control team in Bago. The currently available training module for volunteers in Myanmar will be revised on the basis of WHO training materials on RDT use and job aid illustration(The Quality Assurance Project and the World Health Organization, 2006) that have been tested in a previous study(Harvey, 2008). The training module will consist of the topics on what is malaria, how to do RDT, treatment regimen for RDT positive patients and RDT negative patients, symptoms suggesting for referral of patients to the nearest health service provider, record keeping and reporting. Possible misdiagnosis (particularly pneumonia in children) will also be emphasized. The danger signs will be provided for referral of adults and children. Since previous study showed that the volunteers referred only few children with danger signs(Chinbuah, 2006), it will be recommended to refer all sick children under 5 years immediately after initial RDT and provision of antimalarials. The illustrations will be made on test procedure of RDT. Based on current antimalarial treatment guideline of the National Malaria Control Programme, treatment c CONDITION: Acceptability of trained volunteers for malaria diagnosis and treatment by community Acceptability of trained volunteers for malaria diagnosis and treatment by the health staff Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria Trained volunteers can reduce malaria mortality? PRIMARY OUTCOME: Interval between the first febrile episode and diagnosis by rapid diagnostic test Mortality from all causes Proportions of population with fever who receive malaria diagnosis and appropriate treatment SECONDARY OUTCOME: Acceptability of volunteer system by health staff and community ; ; Acceptability of volunteer system by the health staff will be assessed by self‐administered questionnaire on pay day in all selected six townships in the baseline and at 6 months after intervention. The questionnaire will include a brief instruction to fill in one to two pages form anonymously. It will include both structured and open ended questions. A secret ballot will be used to let health staff put the forms into it. Moreover, qualitative in‐depth interviews with malaria supervisors and informal conversation with health staff will also be noted during data collection period. ; Regarding the acceptability of volunteers by the community, the structured interview questionnaire for subjects with fever within the last 30 days will include questions on their acceptability as well as seeking treatment from the volunteer. In‐depth interviews will be made for 10 subjects who did not seek treatment from volunteers to identify the reasons. Focus group discussions with village leaders will be performed in villages with trained community volunteers to explore the acceptability of volunteer system.

AB: The proposed study will use a 2 group randomized controlled clinical trial design. The two groups are: 1) standard care in the rehabilitation center with control computer exposure (SCCE) and 2) standard care plus computer‐based self‐management pain (CBSM) intervention. The study will examine the short‐ and long‐term effects of these interventions on pain and physical and psychosocial functioning and productivity (DAW, RWD, WC costs and re‐injury) in 200 completing patients with strain/sprain MSID. Outcome data will be collected at baseline, after treatment, and at 3 and 6 month follow‐up. All outcome assessments will be administered by computer. Pain Management Following Musculoskeletal Injury Study. The study is comprised of two phases: Phase I Planning/Development and Phase II Intervention. During Phase I Planning/Development, the study investigators 1) identified technology partner to aid in computerization of intervention; 2) identified sites for study implementation; 3) developed consent forms and tracking procedures; 4) developed computer based self‐management (CBSM) pain intervention; 5) developed computer based educational materials for the control condition; 6) beta tested intervention materials; 7) developed recruitment materials; 8) developed outcome assessment procedures measures. During Phase II Intervention, the study investigators will 1)complete IRB review at each of the study sites; 2) train study personnel, and upon approval from each of the IRBs; 3) initiation of study subject recruitment and intervention. Phase II will begin June 2011 and be completed by June 2013. During Phase II a total of 200 patients will be enrolled in the study. Control Group Individuals with acute MSID, in the employers with on‐site rehabilitation centers, are initially seen by the plant medical office and, if appropriate, referred for rehabilitation services. Patients are given an initial evaluation by the treating physical or occupational therapist and a treatment plan is implemented. The typical patient is seen for an average of approximately 9 visits over a four‐week period. However, patients can be seen as long as indicated. SCCE is seen as the appropriate control condition for several reasons. First, denying patients care is not ethically appropriate. Second, this is type of rehabilitation and injury education is the care typically received by acute MSID patients and is the current standard of practice. Currently the education is provided in written brochures and handouts. The addition of computer interaction for presenting this education controls for threats related to differential time spent in treatment and the novelty of computer supplement to care. The computer exposure will be administered over 8 sessions during the average 4‐week period patients are receiving their standard on‐site rehabilitation care. Patients will come to the center to receive their standard care and then interact with the computer for the 25‐30 minute control condition. The primary goal of this condition is to provide a control for computer exposure. Briefly, the first session will concentrate on establishing the patient's ability to interact with the computer. The materials will provide general education regarding the injury and methods for preventing re‐injury. This condition will not provide teaching and practice of specific pain management and coping management skills. This control computer education activity will equalize the computer exposure of the two groups and the duration of time devoted to injury care. Intervention Group: Will receive the same medical care and physical therapy treatment as the control group. In addition the computer‐based self‐management program (CBSM) intervention will be administered over 8 sessions during the average 4 week period patients are receiving their standard on‐site rehabilitation care. Patients will come to the center to receive their standard care and then interact with the computer for the 25‐30 minute CBSM intervention. The primary goals of treatment include developing skills for managing acute injury and related pain including: reducing fear avoidance beliefs and catastrophizing, improving mood, increasing perceptions of control and self‐efficacy, maintaining activity and reducing pain. The intervention materials are based on the investigators work in the a self‐management program for persons with limb loss and those shown effective in other secondary prevention studies in MSID, specifically the Pain Disability Prevention Program (PDPP) develop by Sullivan. While the PDPP has been evaluated on persons who have been out of work for six weeks or more and this study targets individuals who are more recently injured, the content of the intervention is appropriate for the study population. Each session focuses on specific topics and sets of skills. Skills are presented and modeled by computer‐based video during sessions, audio will be used to explain models and teach skills such as relaxation training. This will supplement any written materials and minimize the need for reading. Patients are instructed to practice and apply skills between sessions. Patients will also be given specific feedback about their progress in working through the CBSM modules. As all CBSM takes place within the on‐site rehabilitation center, staff are available to provide assistance if necessary. The sessions initially focus on pain, which is a primary motivator to the patient, expand the focus to cognitive and emotional factors related to pain and disability and finally move to increasing activity. A home activity will be assigned at completion of the session. The home activity will be printed out for the patient to take home and will be available to the participant through the study website from remote locations. The study intervention and home activities will be refined using focus group and pilot testing methods.

AB: INTERVENTION: Participants are randomised after consent is obtained and baseline data collection to one of two groups using an internet randomization service for clinical trials. Control group: Patients will receive usual home care services provided by the provincial regional home care agency including but not limited to, home visits by assistive personnel for activities of daily living, nursing care, and other supports deemed necessary by case coordinator or case manager in the study site. Intervention group: Patients will receive RM in addition to usual home care services. The intervention group will receive RM sensors tailored to their home care needs that may include sensors to detect medication administration, opening refrigerator/cupboards, use of exit doors, and movement detection and for observation (cameras). Randomization: We will use the services of a randomization program to assign patients to receive either usual home care or remote monitoring with usual home care. Allocation of patients will be communicated to the research staff and patient/ family caregiver by the lead researcher (centralized randomization) by telephone and email. Assessors/care coordinators will be blind to the allocation when identifying potential participants for the study to reduce bias. Patients/caregivers will be blind to the allocation when providing consent to participate but will not be blind to intervention/control arms once randomization occurs. Participants (older adult and their family / friend caregivers) once randomized into the intervention group will have a home visit by the technology partner Care Link Advantage(CLA). They will receive written and verbal overview of the various RM options. Based on the assessment by the CLA technology partner along with patient and family / friend caregiver preferences, RM options will be identified and implemented. The intervention will be offered to the patient for up to 12 months at which time the patient will be transitioned to usual care ( CONDITION: Caring ; Not Applicable PRIMARY OUTCOME: Patient’s Delay/Avoidance of higher levels of care as measured by number of days at home at baseline, 6 and 12 months. ; SECONDARY OUTCOME: 1.

AB: Rationale & hypothesis ‐ Both, management of multi‐morbidity and efficient collaboration between specialized care and community‐based services are unmet needs that can be overcome by implementation of structured, but flexible, service workflows. That is, an ACM approach, as well as appropriate patient health risks assessment and stratification. The service workflow has two sequential phases with specific target outcomes for each of them: i) Short‐term (30 and 90 days after hospital discharge) prevention of hospital‐related events after hospital discharge; and ii) Intervention aiming at long‐term enhanced CCP management. Objectives ‐ To assess the impact of ICT‐supported ACM on: i) reduction of early hospital‐related events including hospital re‐admissions, visits to emergency department and mortality; and, ii) Health value generation of the long‐term intervention, defined as target outcomes achieved relative to their costs.Detailed outcomes include the eleven indicators recommended by the Spanish Health System covering the following dimensions: i) Characteristics of the study groups and health status (i.e, Users attended in primary care and, Health‐related quality of life of patients and caregivers); ii) Intermediate outcomes (Emergency Department visits; General Practitioner visits; Cumulative days per year admitted in hospital; Poli‐medication; Potentially avoidable hospitalizations; Hospital readmissions; Needs for social support); iii) Empowerment (Unhealthy life styles); and, iv) Structure (Access to ICT‐supported integrated care). Moreover, through the program lifespan progresses consolidated by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) will be incorporated. Study design ‐ The large‐scale deployment will be evaluated as an observational study with a matched control group. Assessment will be done by an independent team. The number of patients to be included in the implementation study is approximately one‐thousand individuals per year, including both conventional hospitalization and home hospitalization as recruitment sources. Intervention ‐ The general structure of the service workflow for the intervention group is as follows: Case identification. Identification of candidates for inclusion into the program following the pre‐defined inclusion/exclusion Case evaluation. During hospital admission or home hospitalization. A holistic characterization should be performed covering a threefold aim: i) Comprehensive assessment of each individual's need for health and social support; ii) Individualized pharmacological and non‐pharmacological treatment, including adherence and self‐management interventions needs; iii) Identification of short and long‐term clinical requirements; and, iv) Assessment of barriers that may limit fulfilment of the program. Personalized work plan definition ‐ Personalized action plan based on case evaluation. Work plan execution, follow‐up and event handling with the support provided by information and communication technologies (ICT) that facilitate the program follow up and the handling of unexpected events by: i) fostering patient empowerment for self‐management; ii) enhance patient adherence to the program; iii) facilitating remote supervision; and, iv) allowing patient monitoring. Discharge ‐ At the end of the program evaluation.Eventually, it can be moved to other types of integrated care services depending upon his/her needs. The intervention is implemented by a multidisciplinary team from the hospital and from the Primary Care, of advanced‐practice nurses, physicians, physiotherapists, community nurses, social workers having a general practitioner as a reference. The collaboration between specialized care and primary care is guided by the reform of specialized care in the healthcare sectors initiated in 2006. Both teams share ICT‐supported tools. The intervention during hospital admission includes four key features: 1) A comprehensive assessment of the patient at entry; 2) A two‐hour educational program administered at entry by a nurse followed by distribution of patient‐specific support material. Intervention after hospital discharge a) Phone call at 24 hours; b) Home visit at 72 hours after discharge. Accessibility to the point of care available 24 hours/day; PHF, as self‐management tool and appointment at 1m after discharge. After the transitional phase, the advanced‐practice nurses perform regular training sessions to the community‐based care teams, facilitate high accessibility to specialized care as needed and support functionalities of the PHF for the patients admitted into the program. The number of home care visits, as well as access to specialized care, during the follow‐up 12 month period is individually tailored, and dynamically adapted, to patient needs. Moreover, planned visits by specialized professionals can be scheduled through the day hospital or home visits if this was deemed necessary by primary care teams. ICT‐ Support ‐ The three main actors, namely: i) the healthcare professionals with access to an adaptive case management system for work plan prescription, follow‐up, coaching, and care‐coordination across healthcare tiers; ii) the adaptive case management system supporting execution of the patient work plan and providing a bridge of interoperability and collaborative tools among the patient (through the PHF), the case manager and the electronic medical record; and, iii) the patient, with access to the PHF wherein she/he can answer questionnaires, perform monitoring through mHealth apps, and have access to a follow‐up reports and tailored educational information. Control group ‐ Patients assigned to usual care will follow conventional treatment, being managed by their physician without support by the multidisciplinary team, as described above for the intervention group. Clinical assessment ‐ Evaluation will be done by an independent team at baseline and after the 12‐month follow‐up. The questionnaires are those used by the integrated care team with additions designed to capture patient empowerment characteristics: mental status, activities of daily living, anxiety and depression, health‐related quality of life; acute episodes requiring emergency department consultations and/or hospital admissions within the healthcare sector will be assessed using shared registries from the public health system. Moreover, core outcomes, will be assessed from public registries. Data analysis‐ A sample size of 200 patients per group was necessary to recognize statistically significant effects of the intervention. The estimated number of patients identified during the screening process (one‐thousand per year) is markedly higher than minimum required, thus ensuring enough statistical power. Results will be expressed as mean and standard deviation (SD), or as number and percentages, in the corresponding categories. Comparisons between the two study groups on admission and at 12 months will be performed using unpaired Student t‐test for continuous variables, if variables to be compared have two categories; and, chi‐square tests for non‐continuous variables. Changes within each group were assessed by paired analysis (for example using paired t test). The effects of the intervention on mortality and time to admission will be analyzed respectively using multivariate logistic and Cox regression models, adjusted for baseline differences between groups. We will build saturated models introducing all of the covariates which result statistically significant during bivariate assessment. After this, we will build parsimonious models by excluding, one to one, all of the variables not significant according to the Wald test p‐value. Finally, we will decide the final model, comparing the saturated with the parsimonious models, according to the likelihood ratio test.Statistical significance is set at a p value less than 0.05. Analyses will be done with SPSS release 20. Additionally, qualitative assessment of technology will be done using standard questionnaires and through focus groups.

KY: Stroke
AB: Stroke is the first cause of disability in the world, with a very high social impact. Recovery is partial in 85% of stroke survivors, 35% of whom have a persisting serious disability. The increase in lifespan is leading to a rise in the incidence of stroke, and therefore to a rise in the number of people requiring a rehabilitation program. Rehabilitation programs are mainly focused on walking recovery, with insufficient attention being paid to upper limb recovery. Thirty to 60% of patients treated with conventional therapy present functional deficits of the paretic arm, resulting in an impairment of activities of daily living. Robot‐mediated therapy (RT) has been proposed in the literature as a viable approach for the rehabilitation of the upper limb. A first meta‐analysis of 262 subjects showed that when the duration/intensity of conventional therapy (CT) is matched with that of the robot‐assisted therapy, no difference exists between the two groups in terms of motor recovery, activities of daily living, strength or motor control; instead, when the RT is added to CT, a greater effectiveness can be observed, when compared with regular CT alone (5). A subsequent meta‐analysis by Mehrholz et al., including 19 trials (involving 666 subjects), showed that RT was more effective than other interventions in improving patients' activities of daily living (SMD 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.75, P = 0.009, I2 = 67%). In the same sample, stratified by time since disease onset, the analysis confirmed that RT was more effective in improving the activities of daily living in the 224 acute and sub‐acute patients (within 3 months of stroke onset) (SMD 0.64, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.15, P=0.01, I2 =69%). The same findings were not confirmed in 334 chronic patients (more than 3 months after stroke) (SMD 0.85, 95% CI ‐0.27 to 1.97, P=0.14, I2 =94%). As for the other outcomes, robotic therapy was more effective in improving upper extremity function (SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.69, P = 0.0004, I2 = 45%), but not muscular strength (SMD 0.48, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 1.03, P = 0.08, I2 = 79%). Finally, RT was well accepted by patients, there was no marked increase in the number of drop‐outs, and serious adverse events were rare and unrelated to the robotic treatment (6). In an update of their meta‐analysis, published in 2015, the same research team confirmed that RT was more effective than other therapies in improving activities of daily living (SMD 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.64, P = 0.005, I² = 62%), motor function (SMD 0.35, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.51, P < 0.0001, I² = 36%) and strength (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.70, P = 0.04, I² = 72%) of the upper limb. RT was well accepted by patients, there was no marked increase in the number of drop‐outs (RD 0.00, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.03, P = 0.84, I² = 0%), and serious adverse events were rare and unrelated to the robotic treatment. However, the authors concluded that the evidence quality was low, highlighting the need for more rigorous studies. It should be noted that the authors of the review highlighted the fact that the studies reviewed were heterogeneous in terms of study design (two arms, four arms, parallel groups or cross‐over, duration of follow‐up and selection criteria), of the devices used for the therapeutic treatment, of the patients' characteristics (time since disease onset), of the methodological protocols (methods of randomization, of the blindness of the outcome assessors to group allocation, and of the presence or absence of an intention to treat analysis). However, the authors emphasized that limitations such as the inability to blind the therapist and participants, i.e. the so‐called contamination (provision of the intervention to the control group), and co‐intervention (when the same therapist unintentionally provides additional care to either treatment or comparison group) has often been present in rehabilitation studies. Moreover, they pointed out that sometimes the sample is selected according to comorbidities, age, spasticity or pain; instead, in clinical practice patients are often older, and the prevalence of comorbidity, pain, spasticity and/or limitations of articular function is higher than that reported in the studies analyzed. Therefore, inclusion criteria that allow the effects of a robotic treatment to be evaluated on a larger sample of patients with stroke, with clinical characteristics as close as possible to the real‐world clinical setting, are desirable. Many authors have highlighted the impact on costs and the greater sustainability of the RT when compared with the CT. The latter requires a ratio of one therapist to one patient, while RT, after adequate training of the therapist, allows a ratio of one therapist to every three or four patients, depending on the technology used. RT allows patients' improvements to be assessed even after a single treatment session, to constantly monitor the rehabilitation program and therefore to better define the best rehabilitation strategies. In fact, thanks to the possibility the systems available, it is possible to customize the treatment based on the patients' clinical characteristics. Last but not least, robotic devices involve and motivate patients, providing them with visual and auditory feedback through virtual reality programs in the form of games. Training progresses through increasingly difficult stages that can be linked by patients to their own progress. This becomes an important stimulus to increase the active participation of patients in the rehabilitation program. Almost all scientific papers in the literature have focused on the effects of the use of one or, at most, two robotic devices, compared with a conventional approach. However, even though the anatomy and the motor function of the upper limbs, especially the hand, is extremely complex, all but a very few commercial devices act on a limited number of joints and limit the workspace on a plane. By contrast, during conventional therapy the whole upper limb is routinely treated and the three‐dimensional space, in which the upper limb is normally required to move to accomplish daily activities, is normally explored. In the light of the above, it is very difficult to compare the effects of robotic and traditional approaches. This results in the need for a multi‐set of robots and electromechanical systems, each of which acts on a different joint and/or on a different plane, in upper limb rehabilitation in stroke patients. To the best of our knowledge, the effects of a similar approach, i.e. the use of a multi‐set of robotic devices to restore motor function in patients with stroke, have never been compared with those of a conventional approach. Moreover, the effects should ideally be explored on a large sample of subjects that are representative of clinical practice. Hypothesis. The rationale behind the study is that a multi‐set of robotic devices used to treat the whole upper limb may be more effective than conventional treatments in improving upper limb motor performance, since they raise the degree of motivation and participation among patients, and provide a more intensive, standardized and individualized treatment. Therefore, the investigators wish to verify this hypothesis on a large sample of subjects, within a multicenter study using the same multi‐set of robotic devices and the same outcome measures, to obtain better‐quality scientific evidence than that currently available in the literature. Aim: to assess, using evidence‐based criteria (RCT), the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program targeting all the upper limb joints in stroke patients, using a multi‐set of robotic and technological systems, by comparing it with that of a conventional approach.

AB: Threat of cancer recurrence is a top concern for cancer survivors and carers. Research into fears of cancer recurrence (FCR) has been prolific with particular attention to developing assessment tools, conceptualizing theoretical perspectives and developing/testing psychological interventions to reduce the impact of FCR. An IPOS Special Interest Group (FORWARDS) was formed in 2015 to stimulate FCR research and promote international collaboration. This FORWARDS‐hosted symposium with data from qualitative and quantitative approaches aims to highlight the aspects of FCR research that receives less attention in terms of cancer site studied, longitudinal assessment of these fears, and self‐help for coping with these fears. It will showcase the most current and diverse work that is being done in these areas. The first presentation will be on FCR in lung cancer patients ‐ a group that is not studied as much as some other cancer sites. The second presentation will report on the trajectory of these fears over radiotherapy treatment. The third presentation will report quantitative data from gynecological and breast cancer survivors and the impact of these fears on fertility issues and quality of life. The final presentation will be on qualitative data on the patients' experiences of online self‐help training for FCR. Overall, attendees at this symposium will gain an in depth understanding of the more neglected areas of FCR research and discussion around what future research should endeavor to uncover.

Purpose: To explore FCR in a large heterogeneous lung cancer sample. Methods: As part of a prospective study of quality of life (QOL), 652 patients, up to 16 years after their initial diagnosis (M = 3 years), completed self‐reported scales. The Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the EORTC QOL Questionnaire (C30), and demographic/medical information assessed at baseline (T1) were analyzed. Results: 51% reported a clinical level of FCR (score ≥13) and 36% expressed a severe or pathological FCR (score ≥16). FCR was significantly associated with younger age, female gender, disease progression, chemotherapy, radiation, and non‐surgical cancers, but not with time since initial diagnosis and other demographic variables. High FCR was significantly associated with more anxiety (r = .57) and depression (r = .43) as well as with lower QOL (r = ‐.30). Conclusions: FCR is associated with distress and poor quality of life in lung cancer survivors. Rapid screening and early interventions appear particularly important to prevent the impact of FCR. Supporting Abstract 2: Fears of cancer recurrence trajectory over the course of radiotherapy treatment in breast cancer patients in East of Scotland Gerry Humphris1, 2; Yuan Yang1, 2; Josie Cameron2; Carolyn Bedi2 1‐Medical School, University of St Andrews, Fife, UK 2‐Edinburgh Cancer Centre, Western General Hospital, Crewe Rd South, Edinburgh, UK Background: Fears of cancer recurrence (FCR) in breast cancer patients are common, stable and once developed. Recent evidence shows that the quality of communication between the clinician and patient raises FCR. For example, the use of jargon interrupted message giving, and lack of empathy increase the chances of FCR developing in patients following their diagnostic interview. The aim of this pilot project (FORECAST) is to test the FCR levels in a longitudinal design with 100 patients receiving radiotherapy. Two research questions based upon self‐regulation theory will be tested. First, are FCR levels raised on nearing the termination of treatment? Second, do these levels increase due to clinician communication processes? Audio‐recordings will be taken of the radiotherapist during the period of the 15 to 25 treatment sessions. They will be coded using the Verona coding definitions of emotional sequences (VRCoDES) system to record emotional language and clinician responses. A short form FCR self‐report scale will be collected in a daily diary. Longitudinal structural equation analyses and mixed linear modelling will establish the trajectory of FCR over the course of treatment. This will be the first study to intensively investigate FCR development nearing the end of the patient's treatment cycle. Supporting Abstract 3: Fertility issues, fears of cancer recurrence, and their relationship to the quality of life among young women diagnosed with breast or gynaecological cancer Authors: A. Sobota1; G. Ozakinci1 1‐University of St Andrews, School of Medicine, St Andrews Background: Reproductive concerns and cancer recurrence fears are prominent survivorship issues among young female cancer patients. This study aimed to investigate their relationship to the quality of life (QoL) among reproductive‐age women diagnosed with cancer. Methods: Women diagnosed with breast or gynaecological cancer and aged 18 to 45 at the time of diagnosis were recruited through the clinics and online outlets in the UK and Poland. They were invited to complete a survey investigating fertility‐related distress, cancer recurrence fears, QoL, and their determinants. Results: 164 women completed the questionnaire (mean age as 34.55 ± 6.66 years). Fertility‐related distress as measured by Impact of Event Scale‐Revised was on average 29.36 (SD = 21.71, range 0‐86), fears of cancer recurrence score was on average 26.38 (SD = 8.85, range 7‐40), and the mean QoL score as measured by Quality of Life Adult Cancer Survivors Scale was 99.52 (SD = 32.55, range 39‐273). While QoL was associated with fertility‐related distress in univariate analysis (ρ = 0.51), only the cognitive illness perceptions ‐ consequences, personal control, and identity, negative effect, and fear of recurrence remained significant in the multivariate model. Conclusions: Young female cancer patients' QoL seems to be determined largely by the way they conceptualise their illness and the extent to which they fear cancer coming back. Fertility issues, albeit a source of distress for some women, have a lesser effect on patients' QoL. Supporting Abstract 4: A qualitative study on patients' experiences of online self‐help training for fear of cancer recurrence and future directions Authors: Sanne van Helmondt1, MSc; Joost Bruggeman1, MA; Marije van der Lee1, PhD 1‐Scientific Research Department, Helen Dowling Instituut, Bilthoven, The Netherlands Purpose: One of the most prevalent long‐term consequences of surviving cancer is fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), which is associated with higher healthcare costs and lower quality of life. Because easily accessible and evidence‐based interventions are lacking, an online self‐help training for FCR was developed. Qualitative research gives us insight into patients' experiences of doing an online intervention and what aspects most helped, resulting in future recommendations about tailoring future interventions to the patients' needs. Objective: This study aims to qualitatively explore patients' experiences concerning the helpful and hindering factors of an online selfhelp training for FCR. Methods: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was performed on semi‐structured interviews with 16 women diagnosed with breast cancer 1‐5 years ago, without signs of recurrence or metastasis and aged ≥18 years old. All women were included in the CAREST randomized controlled trial and participated in the online selfhelp training “Less fear after cancer.” Results: Preliminary results show that most women benefit from the intervention. For some however, FCR increased during the intervention. These women experienced lack of social contact or guidance during the intervention. Women with good self‐management skills and a strong social network benefit most from the intervention; it provides them with tools for managing their fear and helps them to regain balance in their daily lives. Conclusions: Online self‐help training is an easily accessible intervention that can be helpful for most, but not all, cancer survivors. Some cancer survivors may benefit more from face‐to‐face therapy. Recommendations for eHealth developers are discussed.

AB: Obstructive sleep apnea is a high‐priority clinical condition for the Veterans Health Administration. With approximately 2% of middle‐aged women and 4% of middle‐aged men having OSA, the disorder places significant burden on the healthcare system. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been linked to major cardiovascular disorders such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, and stroke, as well as increased risk for motor vehicle crashes. Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is considered the treatment of choice for obstructive sleep apnea. However, adherence rates with CPAP and APAP therapy are disappointingly low. Veterans, especially those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged and those with psychiatric disease, demonstrate poor adherence when compared to the general population. Effective interventions are needed to improve adherence among patients diagnosed with OSA. Currently, veterans diagnosed with OSA at the Philadelphia VA sleep center are treated with a home APAP machine that records their adherence on a smart card. They are scheduled for a follow‐up appointment within one to three months after their initiation of APAP therapy to discuss questions and concerns regarding the machine as well as the mask and to download their adherence data. Given the limited availability of clinic appointments, some patients may have to wait longer than this. More recently, APAP machines now distributed through the VA system offer the possibility of using wireless transmissions to track adherence data, including hours of use, mask leak, and apnea‐hypopnea index (this transmission does not require hook up to the telephone and does not require the patient to have internet access). This offers the opportunity to see if remote monitoring within the first several weeks of APAP treatment improves adherence, and in turn, improves clinical response to treatment. At the present time, all patients enrolled at Philadelphia Veterans Administration Medical Center (PVAMC) who are newly diagnosed with OSA are being provided with APAP machines with modems that allow for wireless transmissions of data through the Phillips Respironics HIPPA compliant website, www.encoreanywhere.com. Review of the modem data is being performed on a limited basis in some patients. If remote monitoring improves adherence, the investigators may want to implement it for all APAP users. At present, the investigators do not know if this is a clinically effective or cost effective model for delivering health care. The investigators will have a baseline chart review. It will include assessment of APAP settings (auto‐titrate pressure ranges), model and size of mask interface, baseline sleep study results (mean AHI), and review of surveys now obtained as part of routine clinical care at the investigators sleep center, including: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score, functional outcomes of sleep questionnaire (FOSQ) score, center for epidemiological studies of depression scale (CES‐D score), short form health survey (SF‐12), a health survey score and client satisfaction questionnaire (CSQ‐8). Sleep center staff will also perform a chart review to obtain demographic information (age, sex, race), BMI, daytime oxygen saturation (if available), and co‐morbidities (congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and depression or other psychological disorders) as part of their problem list in the computerized VA medical record. the investigators will use this chart review to compute a Charlson Morbidity Index. The investigators then plan to randomize 126 patients to either usual care or usual care in addition to telemonitoring. Standard of Care Arm: Patients assigned to receive standard of care will be set‐up with an APAP machine through Eagle Home Medical, our contracted local home health care agency. Patients will also receive the sleep staff's phone number should they encounter problems with the use of their new equipment. Patients will be scheduled to see a sleep practitioner within one to three months of the initiation of APAP therapy. At the follow‐up office visit, practitioners will assess mask leak, mean daily APAP usage, AHI through either secure digital (SD) cards or Encore Anywhere. Practitioners will also calculate the patient's ESS score and inquire about frequent complications associated with APAP‐usage, such as dry mouth and mask discomfort. After three months of treatment, all patients in the usual care arm will also have their EncoreAnywhere data reviewed. They will receive a phone call from our sleep center staff to assess their experience with their APAP machines. If patients have not had a follow‐up clinic visit, they will be scheduled for one. In addition, all subjects will be mailed survey to reassess their functional outcomes including: ESS score, FOSQ‐ 10, another subjective measurement of sleepiness, the CES‐D score, an assessment of depression symptoms, the CSQ‐8, an assessment of patient satisfaction, and the SF‐12 health survey, an assessment of health. Telemonitoring Arm: Patients will be set‐up with an APAP machine through Eagle Home Medical, our contracted local home health care agency. Patients will also receive the sleep staff's phone number should they encounter problems with the use of their new equipment. Patients will be scheduled to see a sleep practitioner within one to three months of the initiation of APAP therapy. At that follow‐up appointment, APAP settings, APAP adherence, mask comfort, humidifier usage, and ESS score will be assessed. In addition, patients in the telemonitoring arm will have their adherence data monitored by sleep research staff. Patients who demonstrate poor adherence will receive phone calls at scheduled intervals (Day 2, Day 9, and Day 16). Poor adherence is defined as a large mask leak for 30% of the night, 30% or more of days with less than 4 hours of use, or an AHI > 10 events/hr. Day 2 (Can call up to 120 hours after initiation of treatment) Two days after initiation of APAP data, intervention arm patients will have their data reviewed by the sleep study staff. Patients will receive a follow‐up call if any of the following are present: large mask leak, 30% or more of days with less than 4 hours of use, or machine measured average AHI > 10 events/hr. Patients will be assessed for symptoms such as dry mouth, mask issues, or discomfort with the device, or any other problems. Interventions to improve adherence (i.e.: a different mask, chin strap, modifications of pressure settings, modifications of humidifier settings, saline nasal sprays) will then be prescribed if needed. Patients will also be given the sleep center number if they have questions regarding the use of their equipment. Day 9: (Can call up to 120 hours after Day 9) Patients in the intervention arm will have their data reviewed again. They will receive a follow‐up call if poor adherence is noted. Symptoms will be assessed and interventions to improve adherence will be offered. Day 16: (Can call up to120 hours after Day 16) Patients in the intervention are will have their data reviewed again and called if poor adherence and/or efficacy is noted. Symptoms will be assessed and interventions to improve adherence will be offered. Three Month Follow‐up: All patients will have their EncoreAnywhere data reviewed. If patients have not had a follow‐up visit within one to three months of APAP set‐up, they will be scheduled for one. Surveys will be mailed to all subjects to reassess functional outcomes, including: ESS, FOSQ, CES‐D, SF‐12 health survey, and CSQ‐8.

AB: INTRODUCTION: From September 2005 to February 2007 the Australian Government funded the Point of Care Testing (PoCT) in General Practice Trial, a multi‐centre, cluster randomised controlled trial to determine the safety, clinical effectiveness, cost‐effectiveness and satisfaction of PoCT in General Practice. In total, 53 practices (23 control and 30 intervention) based in urban, rural or remote locations across three states (South Australia [SA], New South Wales [NSW] and Victoria [VIC]) participated in the Trial. Control practices had pathology testing performed by their local laboratory, while intervention practices conducted pathology testing by PoCT. In total, 4968 patients (1958 control and 3010 intervention) participated in the Trial. The point‐of‐care (PoC) tests performed by intervention practices were: haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) on patients with diabetes, total cholesterol, triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol on patients with hyperlipidaemia, and international normalised ratio (INR) on patients on anticoagulant therapy. Three PoCT devices measured these tests: the Siemens DCA 2000 (Siemens HealthCare Diagnostics, Melbourne, VIC, Australia) for HbA1c and urine ACR; Point of Care Diagnostics Cholestech LDX analyser (Point of Care Diagnostics; Sydney, NSW, Australia) for lipids; and the Roche CoaguChek S (Roche Diagnostics; Sydney, NSW, Australia) for INR. Point‐of‐care testing in the General Practice Trial was underpinned by a quality management framework which included an on‐going training and competency program for PoCT device operators. This article describes the design, implementation and results of the training and competency program. METHODS: An education and training resource package was developed for the Trial consisting of a training manual, a set of A3 laminated posters and a CD ROM. Five initial training workshops were held for intervention practices from each geographic region between August and October 2005 at three centres ‐ Adelaide (SA), Bendigo (VIC) and Dubbo (NSW). These workshops combined theoretical training in the principles and practice of PoCT with 'hands on' practical training delivered in interactive small group sessions. At the completion of training, practice staff undertook a written and practical competency assessment and received a certificate of competency as a qualified device operator. Following each initial training workshop, practice staff completed a short satisfaction survey. Five refresher training workshops covering all geographic regions were delivered during late August 2006, coinciding with the 12 month point of the live phase of the Trial. At the completion of the Trial in February 2007, device operators completed a further questionnaire. RESULTS: Sixty device operators from 31 practices completed training and competency assessment as part of the Initial Training Workshop series. A further 20 device operators from 12 of the practices were trained in the 12 month period after the initial workshops; 19 of these staff were from rural or remote practices. In total 80 device operators comprising 74 practice staff and six GPs from 31 practices were trained and received competency certificates as part of Trial. In all, 19 device operators left the Trial either through personal resignation from an existing practice or because their practice withdrew from the Trial; the majority (84%) were from rural and remote practices. A total of 42 device operators from 25 practices attended refresher training in the second half of 2006. Results from the satisfaction questionnaire completed by device operators following the initial training workshops showed there was unanimous agreement that the posters were useful for the conduct of daily PoCT and practical training in small groups was satisfactory as a training method. The quality and appropriateness of the PoCT training resources and the workshop overall was rated as either good or excellent by all respondents (100% and 78%, respectively). The responses by device operators to the post‐Trial satisfaction questionnaire found a high level of satisfaction with PoCT across all geographic regions. Device operators from remote practices had the highest satisfaction levels for quality of training, usefulness of the training manual, ease of use of devices, confidence in the accuracy of PoCT results and preference for PoCT over laboratory testing. The usefulness of the posters for conducting PoCT achieved the highest satisfaction rating among operators from all three geographic regions. However the highest staff turnover rates and the highest number of requests for training of additional staff were from rural and remote practices. CONCLUSION: The methods established for the implementation and delivery of training and competency assessment for the PoCT in General Practice Trial were appropriate and effective. Results of the evaluation showed rural and remote practices have a greater need for training and support compared to their urban counterparts and may require more flexible training options to cater for much higher rates of staff turnover.

AB: While the nation's overall health status has improved over the past decade, disparities persist among racial/ethnic minorities, low‐income whites, the medically under‐served, and rural residents. The disparities in disease morbidity and mortality are a compelling crisis and the elimination of such disparities is a national priority. With an aging population, the changing demographics are increasing the disease burden attributable to chronic diseases. The broad goal of this project is to evaluate the potential value of using THC technology in chronically ill patients in rural Maryland, within the broad context of social determinants of health. This builds upon a completed pilot research study in Garrett County on a small scale THC program in rural Garrett County Maryland funded by the Maryland Cigarette Restitution Fund (CRF) supported Other Tobacco Related Diseases (OTRD grant) (CBaquet PI) in collaboration with the division of cardiology and department of family medicine. This research study will look at whether the THC equipment in the home for 60 days will make a difference in the health of the patients who get the unit in their home compared to the patients who will not receive the unit for 60 days. And we will look at whether this technology will support patient monitoring in the home. The use of the technology will be evaluated to determine whether patient monitoring using THC equipment will influence the hospitalization rates or emergency department visits for the patients. Evaluation of the influence of the THC equipment on medical resource utilization in rural and medically underserved communities will be studied. Telehome care (THC) may provide augmentation to current face to face monitoring through home visits (usual method for Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) billable home health services) of chronically ill patients and may provide an innovative and potentially cost‐effective solution to improving patients' outcomes and health care resource utilization in rural areas. THC can support the coordination of care by assessing and monitoring patients in their homes and giving health care providers appropriate feedback to assure patient compliance with discharge instructions such as medication, home care and other aspects of recommended treatment regimens. Further, THC may improve service coordination at discharge and provide ongoing monitoring/engagement of patients, which is considered essential to prevent re‐hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Demonstration of the potential benefits on care pathways, and patient and provider acceptance and satisfaction with the technology requires systematic larger scale and scientifically rigorous studies. Purpose The project's broad goals are to evaluate the effects of telehome care (THC), a form of remote patient home monitoring,(within the broad context of social determinants of health) for chronic disease management among rural residing minority, low‐income white, and medically underserved patients by: (a) providing an innovative telehome care (THC) capacity and infrastructure in two Maryland rural and medically underserved communities; and (b) using the THC infrastructure to generate scientifically rigorous and high quality evidence on whether the THC technology improves patient monitoring, influences clinical outcomes, and has an impact on medical resource utilization. [NOTE: THC uses telecommunication technologies to enable home health agency clinical staff at a rural home health agency to monitor their patients in the home.] The major aim for this study are: 1) To evaluate the impact of the 60‐day in home THC monitoring on medical resource utilization (emergency department visits; re‐hospitalization rates) and Quality of Life related to the management of Metabolic Syndrome/Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Hypertension (HTN), and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) compared to those patients that receive only an educational pamphlet. Secondary aim hopes to support patient education to enhance acceptability, patient independence and satisfaction. In this study, remote in‐home patient monitoring using a THC system from VitelNet (telehealth equipment vendor) will provide patient monitoring remotely or non billable services for the experimental study arm for this project in addition to routine billable home health services. This project does not substitute billable in‐home monitoring of patients which is a prerequisite for enrollment into this study(conventional home health services) but provides remote monitoring for the study arm in addition to conventional/billable services delivered. Patients are randomized to either THC use for 60 days with 60, 90 day follow up or "usual care" with 60, 90 day follow up. In addition, new knowledge will be generated by this study on methods for conduct of health disparities research and training of non‐research clinical personnel who are community based in data collection and research ethics.

AB: Background and Overview This study will evaluate the efficacy of a newly developed self‐management program, Health Mechanics, to develop and improve bladder and bowel management skills among persons with new and chronic SCI. Program participation is expected to prevent bladder and bowel related medical complications (e.g., constipation, leakage), leading to enhanced social participation and QOL. Health Mechanics was designed by the study PI, Dr. Meade, between 2007 and 2009 with funding from the Paralyzed Veteran's of America Education Foundation to assist persons with SCI develop and transfer the necessary skills to keep their bodies healthy while managing the many aspects of SCI care. This study will investigate the effectiveness of a telehealth version of Health Mechanics to enhance self‐management skills related to neurogenic bladder and bowel management in an attempt to prevent associated complications and improve QOL. The study makes a unique contribution to rehabilitation by emphasizing the concepts of personal responsibility and control over one's health and life as a whole. By selecting a telehealth approach (here defined as telephone‐based) for program implementation, the investigators also attempt to address the high cost of care delivery and lack of health care access to underserved populations with SCI living in remote areas of the State of Michigan. The Health Mechanics program is designed based on the needs and strengths of individuals with SCI while being responsive to identified gaps and challenges of health care provision in this population. The program focuses on enhancing skills, encouraging positive health behaviors and empowering people within their own environments, recognizing that people have different resources and abilities. For this study, the Health Mechanics program has been adapted to specifically focus on bladder and bowel management related concerns and to be administered via telephone, thus better addressing the needs of the rural population and transportation‐related challenges. By teaching skills to better manage bladder and bowel health, this self‐management program should not only reduce the occurrence of complications but it should also result in higher levels of social integration and QOL. Since the skills taught ‐ attitude, self‐monitoring, problem‐solving, communication, organization and stress management ‐ will be addressed in the context of performing the behaviors necessary to enhance bladder and bowel health, we expect them to generalize into other areas such that improvements in these skills result in better overall health and participation. Purpose and Objectives The proposed study's overall purpose is to evaluate the effects of Health Mechanics in preventing bladder and bowel complications and to improve QOL. The program specifically targets newly injured individuals for early prevention of complications, as well individuals with chronic injuries for later treatment and prevention of complications. Objectives are: 1) to improve self‐management skills, including problem‐solving, knowledge of health behaviors, and attitude about disability; 2) to increase adherence to recommended bladder and bowel management behaviors; 3) to improve bladder and bowel health and related QOL; and 4) to determine the extent that program improvements in terms of skills acquired are sustained over time. Short‐term refers to 3 and 6 months assessments while long‐term refers to the 12 month assessment. All hypotheses posit that, following the intervention, differences will exist such that participants in the Health Mechanics program will perform better than the control group (an assessment of between group differences) and that these differences will be sustained over time (an assessment of within and between group differences). It is expected that individuals with new injuries will improve over time regardless of group assignment, while individuals with chronic injuries are stabilized prior to admission to the study. Because of these naturally occurring differences in trajectory, we will be examining within and between group differences. Research Hypotheses H1: Program participants will show greater improvements in problem solving skills, healthy attitudes about disability and knowledge of SCI management skills than will the control group; these improvements will be sustained over time within and between groups. H2: Program participants will have greater adherence to recommended bladder and bowel management behaviors than the control group; these improvements will be sustained over time within and between groups. H3: Program participants will have fewer bladder and bowel complications than the members of the control group; these differences will be maintained over time within and between groups. H4: Program participants will have higher levels of QOL than the control group; these differences will be sustained over time within and between groups.

SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct01671293
YR: 2012
KY: Glucose Intolerance; Prediabetic State
AB: International data report that the population with prediabetes is approximately twice the population with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 (DM2) both in the U.S. and Latin America. Given prediabetes estimated prevalence in Chile (8 to 15%) and considering the high risk for developing DM2 that prediabetic people present, as well as the high cost associated with treating this disease and its consequences, it is essential to look for strategies to prevent and/or delay this process. People under 45 years who are overweight and have altered glucose tolerance test constitute a population who is at high risk for developing DM2 (MINSAL, 2009). It has been shown that weight loss and increase of moderate physical activity reduces by 58% the risk of developing DM2 (The Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group, 2002), however, at primary care, people who are informed of having prediabetes usually present no access to the available services to support them in the process of changing behaviors that are at the core of this condition. This study aims to design, implement and evaluate a multi‐component remote care model to support people with prediabetes who are overweight or obese, at self‐management of their risk behaviors of unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. This study seeks to determine whether remote care interventions aimed at overweight or obese people with prediabetes, carried out by professionals trained in motivational interviewing, behavior change theories and support health decision‐making, with knowledge of prediabetes and effective interventions for coping are effective for: a) Increase participants knowledge about the risks of this condition and how to prevent them b) Provide effective support that results in an increase in daily physical activity c) Provide effective support to ensure change in their eating habits d) Achieve reduction in clinical parameters values of glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides e) Attain decrease in the anthropometric parameters body weight and waist circumference (associated with the modification of the unwanted habits). The counseling intervention is the core of the multi‐component remote care model, which also includes counseling through text messages, the purveyance of educational material, and self‐monitoring equipment (pedometers and measuring tape for patients to check their waist circumference). The calls are made by professionals working at health centers who have been trained to apply theories on behavioral change and decision‐making. Phone counseling are conducted at least once a month. Three different types of counseling are included: (a) Welcome: aimed at exploring the factors that promote behavioral change and the goals that the patient must reach to deal with prediabetes; (b) Follow‐up: aimed at accompanying the patient and/or monitoring the attainment of goals associated with the desired behavioral change, (c) Completion: for closing the intervention process, reinforcing achievements, and inviting the patient to maintain the behavioral changes made. Short Message Service (SMS) counseling is aimed at providing information and encouraging the patient to change his/her behavior in terms of nutrition and physical activity. Messages are sent weekly and are related to the topics referred to in counseling sessions. The educational material and equipment ‐‐respectively‐‐ seek to provide additional information and foster the habit of self‐monitoring progress and/or reversions in the change process. A randomized clinical study was designed, including a sample of 70 (both groups) people diagnosed with prediabetes and altered BMI, registered in 5 primary care centers in the La Florida commune, Santiago, Chile. The intervention will last 6 months. The control group will receive usual care from health centers consisting of an indication of physical activity and healthy eating recommendations, as well as referral to Dietitian if appropriate, an invitation to participate in educational activities at health centers and periodic inspection appointments. Apart from the usual care provided in health centers, the intervention group will also receive the four components of the remote care model. Pre and post intervention measurements will be applied. At the end of the intervention (after post‐measurement) control group participants will be invited to participate in an educational workshop to improve eating practices and physical activity, and will receive educational materials generated by this project, thus ensuring the principle of equity in the project's development. For the intervention group, the program is expected to lead to increased knowledge on prediabetes, increment in physical activity, improvement of clinical and anthropometric parameters as well as of eating habits, all of these are non expected results for the control group.

KY: Body Weight; Weight Loss
AB: Telemedicine can be defined as using communication technologies, specifically video conferencing, to support long‐distance delivery of clinical health care and patient and professional health‐related education. Video conferencing (VC) has been used since the early 1990's as a tool to monitor symptoms (Hubble et al. 1992), and it has also been used in various subspecialties such as heart disease (Winters & Winters, 2007), diabetes prevention/management (Davis et al. 2010), mental health care (O'Reilly et al. 2007), and for providing nutritional advice (Rollo et al. 2015). Evidence regarding the effectiveness of video conferencing is amassing with systematic reviews revealing promising results in the management of various chronic diseases (Pronk et al. 2011). However, to date there are no published studies investigating a fully online, medically monitored, weight loss program utilizing VC. The application of VC has the potential to shift current clinical practice for medical weight management/weight loss from traditional in‐person medical office visits to remote delivery using VC. eClinicalWorks® (ECW)l) is a telemedicine service company providing cost effective medical care solutions to patients through the use of technology.ECW® provides patients with an easy‐to‐use application that enables face‐to‐face contact with a healthcare provider through the use of VC on their smart device from any location. The ECW® application which will be utilized in the present study will be fully customized to utilize Bluetooth connectivity to sync with commercially available clinical assessment tools such as body weight scales and physical activity trackers to monitor obesity related health outcomes. Through the integration of tools into a customized smartphone application provided by ECW®, health care professionals in the present study will be able to evaluate a participant's body weight, body composition, and physical activity through one convenient smartphone application. Within the obesity prevention and management strategies, the use of health coaching is one possible way to improve patient lifestyle behavior change. Health coaching can be defined as the "practice of providing health education within a coaching context to enhance the knowledge of individuals which helps facilitate the achievement in their health‐related goals'' (Olson and Nesbitt et al. 2010). A fairly recent study (Ferrante et al. 2009) in which more than 500 physicians were surveyed on their practices and management strategies regarding extreme obesity (BMI ≥40kg/m2) indicated that having a readily available nutrition and exercise therapist would be helpful in improving the quality of care in these patients, thereby highlighting the benefits gained by using health coaches. The majority of health coaching intervention studies investigating behavior change have been personalized and conveyed to the individual participant through several mediums including telephone, (Huber et al. 2015), web‐based chatting (Hersey et al. 2012, Bennett et al. 2010), or a combination of in‐person and web‐based delivery (Appel et al. 2011; Bennett et al. 2005). Additionally, there appears to be great variability between interventions in the type of health care professional utilized as health coaches including: nurses, health counselors, registered dietitians, primary care providers, or diabetes educators (Kivela et al. 2014). However, using a health coaching approach in which a multi‐disciplinary team (medical doctor, registered dietitian, and exercise physiologist) is utilized, as in the present study, has yet to be examined. This is especially important as recent evidence has shown that increased collaboration between healthcare professionals may enhance patient adherence, education, and medical monitoring (Jeon & Park, 2015). In addition to the utilization of both health coaching and VC, health professionals are always seeking ways to objectively monitor and improve their patients' health and fitness, especially between patient visits. A potential way health professionals can monitor a patient's health metrics is through mobile health (mHealth) devices including smartphones and wearable fitness trackers, as well as wireless weight scales, blood pressure cuffs, and glucometers (Shaw et al. 2016). However, to leverage mHealth devices as tools to promote patient self‐monitoring, the integrated use of mHealth devices which collect, display, and secure data through a unified system is needed. To date, only one study (Shaw et al. 2016) examined the feasibility of multiple mHealth devices which transmitted data to a secure US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database. Therefore, The primary aim of this study was to assess changes in physical activity, body weight and metabolic markers (fasting blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, and hemoglobin A1c) in obese adults randomized into either a control group or one of two intervention groups (an in‐person group or VC group).

AB: INTERVENTION: A remote randomisation service will assign allocation to groups coordinated by the Norwich Clinical Trials Unit. Allocation is by pre‐set lists of permuted blocks with randomly distributed block sizes (agreed with the trial statistician). The trial allocation ratio is 1:1. Randomisation will be stratified by: initial PTSD symptom severity (CRIES‐8 score <29 vs =29); and site (i.e. NHS Trust from where the participant was recruited). Intervention group: Participants receive treatment with CT‐PTSD (Cognitive therapy‐PTSD). This involves participating in up to 15 treatment sessions (typically 10‐12, of 60‐90 minutes duration), to be completed within five months of randomisation where possible. The sessions themselves focus on psychoeducation, exposure (to help desensitise patients to trauma memories), cognitive elements (to reframe the meanings and interpretations associated with trauma and its aftermath), and coping management (e.g. problem‐solving, anxiety management). The CT‐PTSD will be delivered by NHS child and adolescent or youth mental health service clinicians who have completed intensive training in CT‐PTSD by a member of the trial team. CT‐PTSD will be delivered wherever is permitted and feasible for local clinicians (e.g. in NHS mental health clinics, local GP surgeries, home). Following the completion of a course of CT‐PTSD, usual NHS care arrangements will apply for participants in this arm, coordinated by the trial team, the participants’ GPs and the original referrers.

AB: Hypothesis/aims of study Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the commonest disabling neurological disease affecting younger adults. Neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD) occurs in 50‐80% of these patients and is the term used to describe constipation and faecal incontinence (FI) which often coexist with MS. A pilot study of 30 people with MS found benefits with an intensively supported programme of abdominal massage (weekly home visits by a nurse)(1). We undertook a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine clinical and cost‐effectiveness of abdominal massage in the management of NBD with fewer supervised sessions which may be deliverable within existing United Kingdom national health services. Study design, materials and methods This was a parallel group multicentre RCT. People with MS who had reported constipation symptoms as being bothersome, and had no confounding 'red flags' e.g. rectal bleeding, were invited to take part. Participants (and a carer if assisting with massage) in the intervention group were randomised to a one‐to‐one session of instruction on abdominal massage. They were provided with training materials demonstrating the technique including a video and written/diagrammatic information, and were given a lifestyle advice leaflet for the alleviation of symptoms of constipation. Participants in the control group were also seen once when the advice leaflet alone was provided. During the six weeks of intervention, all participants were telephoned weekly and offered support regarding abdominal massage (intervention group) and discussion of lifestyle changes (both groups). Randomisation was by computer allocation using a remote randomisation service. Minimisation variables were: centre, disability level of the participant (walking unaided, aided, wheelchair). A daily bowel diary was completed a week prior to randomisation, during the whole six weeks of treatment and during week 23. A diary recording the massage undertaken was also completed by the intervention group participants. Questionnaires were administered at baseline, 6 and 24 weeks post‐randomisation. The primary outcome was the Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction (NBD) Score (2), a clinician‐administered questionnaire validated in spinal cord injured patients, at 24 weeks. The NBD score is a 10 item questionnaire covering: frequency of bowel movements; headache, perspiration or discomfort during defaecation; medication for constipation; time spent on defaecation; frequency of digital stimulation or evacuation; frequency of FI; medication for FI; flatus; and perianal skin problems. The NBD score ranges from 0 to 47; scores over 14 are considered severe. Secondary outcomes included a bowel diary, constipation scoring system (3), adherence to the intervention, bladder function and quality of life (EQ‐5D‐5L) (4). A process evaluation was undertaken alongside the trial. Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat. NBD scores were compared between trial groups using repeated measures mixed models with adjustment for gender, minimisation variables and (if applicable) baseline measurements. A sample size calculation (using a 5% level of significance (two‐sided), 90% power and allowing for 20% dropout. indicated a trial of 150 was necessary to detect a difference in the primary outcome measure of 4.2. The funders recommended this was increased to 200 to allow for higher attrition. We report here results of the analysis of the primary outcome measure. Results In total 191 participants were randomised, of which 189 provided data (2 participants withdrew immediately post‐randomisation). The trial group characteristics were well‐balanced at baseline. Mean age was 52 years (SD 10.83 years). Most participants were able to walk unaided (n=79, 41.8%) or with a walking aid (n=89, 47.1%), the remainder using a wheelchair (n=21, 11.1%). The majority were female (n= 154, 81.5%). Massage was self‐administered in 84% (n=73). At 24 weeks 71% (n=51) were continuing with the massage, all except one of whom were undertaking self‐massage, with 80% (n=44) reporting that they felt a benefit. The response rate for the NBD score at 24 weeks was 81% (n=153). There was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in the NBD score at 24 weeks (Table 1) (mean difference in NBD score‐1.64 95% CI‐3.32 to 0.04, p=0.0558), nor immediately post intervention (6 weeks) (mean difference in NBD score‐0.58 95% CI‐2.38 to 1.22, p=0.5236). (Table presented) There were 10 serious adverse events requiring hospitalisation but none were related to the abdominal massage (3 MS relapses, one myocardial infarction 1 myocardial infarction, 3 infections, 3 falls). Interpretation of results There is weak evidence of a small effect (<2 units on NBD scale) at week 24 and many participants continued to self‐massage. However, the 95% confidence interval of‐3.3 units rules out the minimally important clinically difference of 4.2 that we originally estimated. Concluding message From the preliminary analysis of the data a home programme of abdominal massage may offer a small reduction in some of the symptoms of neurogenic bowel dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis. Analysis of the other outcomes is underway and may offer further insights.

AB: Hypothesis / aims of study The aim of the MAPS study (two parallel trials) was to identify the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of a strategy of one‐to‐one pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) compared to standard management, in men who had urinary incontinence (UI) after prostate surgery, either radical prostatectomy (RP) (trial 1) or transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) (trial 2). The primary outcome was UI at 12 months after randomisation. There were no differences between the randomised groups in either trial at one year.(1) This paper will present two year data for prevalence and type of urinary incontinence and other relevant clinical outcomes amongst the two groups of men. Study design, materials and methods Men having prostate surgery were identified in 34 centres and invited to receive a screening questionnaire. Those men who had UI at six weeks after operation and consented were randomised. Men randomised to the intervention group were invited to attend four one‐to‐one sessions with a therapist over a period of three months for pelvic floor muscle training and bladder training / urge suppression. The control group did not attend therapist sessions but received standard management. Both groups received a Lifestyle Advice Leaflet. Randomisation was by computer allocation using a remote randomisation service. Allocation was stratified by type of operation (RP or TURP), and minimised using centre, age and pre‐existing UI. The process was independent of all clinical collaborators. Outcome measures were measured at one and two years: presence and severity of UI; performance of pelvic floor muscle exercises; bowel problems; and sexual dysfunction. Outcomes were assessed using International Consultation on Incontinence survey instruments (www.iciq.net) administered by postal questionnaire. Primary outcome analysis was by intention to treat (responders at two years) and adjusted for age and pre‐existing UI. Results From the men having RP (742) and TURP (2590), 411 and 442 respectively were randomised; at one year, 391/411 (95%) and 397/413 (96%) men were followed up. Of the men still in the study at two years, 361/391 (92%) and 344/397 (87%) respectively responded. The prevalence of UI was still high in both clinical groups (Table 1). While there was little difference between the randomised groups in the RP trial (adjusted RR 1.03 [95% CI 0.92 to 1.17]; P=0.573), more men in the intervention group were incontinent after TURP (RR 1.18 [1.01 to 1.38]; P=0.0370) although the differences in severe UI and pad use were not significant (Table 1). While there were no significant differences between the randomised groups, the men were more likely to have stress urinary incontinence (SUI) after a RP (compared to after TURP), while urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) was more common after TURP (Table 1). Analysis including non‐responders as dry were also not significantly different (Trial 1: UI 68% vs 63%; Trial 2: 53% vs 47%). Over a third of the original population of men screened after surgery were still wet after RP (270/742, 36%), as were 9% after TURP (221/2590). In general, more men reported abnormal bowel function after TURP than after RP (Table 2), but TURP men were around 10 years older at the time of operation. In contrast sexual dysfunction was much higher after RP and men were much more likely to seek treatment (around 60% of men had tried either medical or vacuum devices, Table 2). Again, there were no statistically significant differences according to randomisation. (Table presented) Interpretation of results The levels of urinary, bowel and sexual dysfunction after both RP and TURP indicate a high level of unmet need. These factors would be expected to have a significant effect on quality of life, and effective treatment might significantly improve the adverse effects of prostate surgery. However, it is clear that one‐to‐one PFMT does not improve two‐year outcomes, probably because much information is already available in the public domain. Concluding message One‐to‐one PFMT was not effective compared to standard care, either at one or two years after surgery. However, there was a significant burden of unmet need in terms of urinary, bowel and sexual function problems which merit further research into their effect on men's quality of life and men's need for further treatment.

YR: 2018
AB: INTERVENTION: Patients will be randomly assigned (stratified by age, gender, and depression severity) to an extended personalised physical activity and exercise counselling program (intervention group) or to general instructions about health‐enhancing physical activity (placebo control group). To ensure allocation concealment, allocation to groups will be done by a computer‐generated code after the baseline assessment has taken place. To minimise subjective biases, patients do not know whether they have been allocated to the intervention or placebo control group. Before providing informed consent, patients will be informed that the goal of the study is to test different methods to promote a more physically active lifestyle among patients with major depressive disorders who do not meet levels of physical activity recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine. Clinicians, researchers, and physical activity facilitators will not be blinded to treatment allocation because of the nature of the study. However, outcomes will be assessed by researchers who do not know whether a patient belongs to the intervention or placebo control group. Patients assigned to the intervention group will receive 12 months of individually tailored physical activity counselling to provide support and encouragement to increase physical activity during and after clinical treatment. This intervention is based on a standardised, theory‐based, short, low cost lifestyle physical activity counselling program, which was specifically designed for an in‐patient rehabilitation setting. It consists of three face‐to‐face meetings in which tailored exercise prescriptions and behavioural change techniques will be delivered. The exercise prescriptions follow the standards of the American College of Sports Medicine and behavioural change techniques include motivational and volitional strategies to promote and foster long‐term behavioural change. Additionally, after hospitalisation, remote meetings will continue un CONDITION: Depression ; Mental and Behavioural Disorders ; Major depressive disorder (MDD) PRIMARY OUTCOME: 1.

TI: Preference-Based Exercise RCT for Men With PC on ADT
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03335631
YR: 2017
AB: BACKGROUND: The backbone of scientific evidence to address most scientific questions, including behavioural interventions, is randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men, affecting 1 in 7 men. Almost 50% of these men will receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) at some point after diagnosis to reduce disease progression and prolong survival. ADT is associated with multiple adverse effects, including diminished quality of life (QOL), fatigue, reduced muscle mass, and metabolic effects. Numerous RCTs in the setting of men on ADT have demonstrated that exercise programs, particularly supervised 1:1 in‐centre programs, are clinically effective. However, they are resource‐intensive and have low scalability. Alternative delivery models such as group‐based supervised exercise or home‐based exercise are promising alternatives but require rigorous efficacy data. While conducting a two‐centre exercise trial comparing different exercise delivery models, fewer than 40% of eligible men agreed to participate. Two common reasons why men declined participation were distance to exercise centres and unwillingness to be randomized. Novel clinical trial designs, such as preference‐based trials, may help answer effectiveness questions and enhance generalizability by recruiting a more representative pool of men. Increased efficiencies in recruitment, however, may come at a cost of bias with non‐randomized designs as well as differential effects of exercise and varying adherence. In parallel with a multi‐centre phase III RCT funded by CIHR, we propose to conduct a pilot preference‐based trial, examining 3 key issues. First, can we successfully enroll men who are unwilling to be randomized due either to distance from centre or a strong preference for one exercise delivery model? Second, are these men different from men who are randomized in terms of baseline characteristics, study retention, and adherence to the intervention? Third, are the benefits of an exercise program similar to men who are randomized to the same arm? OBJECTIVES: To determine, in men on ADT who are otherwise eligible to participate in a RCT of different exercise delivery models but decline to be randomized due to distance from the study centre or strong preference for one exercise delivery model: 1. What proportion of these men are willing to be enrolled in a preference‐based trial. 2. How comparable are these men who agree to participate in the intervention arm of their choice to those randomized to the same arm in terms of baseline characteristics, study retention, and adherence to the intervention? 3. How comparable are the benefits in terms of quality of life and physical fitness outcomes among men in the preference‐based arms to those in the same randomized intervention arm? METHODS: Patients aged 18 or older on ADT for high‐risk/locally advanced, biochemically relapsed, or asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer will be eligible if they are otherwise eligible for an ongoing phase III RCT of exercise but decline to participate due to either distance from study centre or strong preference for one exercise delivery model. The main phase III RCT is examining a 6‐month individualized, progressive, mixed‐modality exercise program including aerobic, resistance, and flexibility components delivered using one of two delivery models: supervised in‐centre group exercise 3 times weekly or home‐based exercise supported by a Fitbit, smart phone app, and remote health coach. To meet the objectives of this pilot preference trial, we will enroll 50 men per preference arm at three experienced study sites (Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Scarborough and Rouge Hospital, Scarborough and the University of Calgary, Calgary and). We will examine the proportion of otherwise eligible men who decline participation in the RCT but agree to participate in a preference trial as well as reasons for declining. We will compare the baseline sociodemographic, fitness, and clinical characteristics of these men with corresponding men from the randomized trial. We will examine study retention and adherence (measured via sessional attendance, health coach contact, and accelerometry). We will also calculate preliminary within‐group effect estimates for our co‐primary outcomes (fatigue (FACT‐Fatigue) and aerobic fitness (6‐minute walk test) as well as various secondary outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE: Behavioural interventions require significant patient commitment and although most RCTs to date have shown evidence of benefit on various outcomes, recruitment rates have been low and many otherwise eligible men are not willing to be randomized for different reasons. Designing trials that allow inclusion of such men is obviously going to improve generalizability but whether the results of interventions are similarly effective and understanding the feasibility and potential biases of enrolling such men are fundamental unresolved issues. This pilot study will take advantage of an existing trial to begin to answer these questions and determine whether a larger preference‐based trial is worth undertaking. Our findings have potential widespread implications for behavioural trials across many health care settings.

TI: Effects of Verbal Intervention on Late and Moderately Late Preterm Infants With Sustained Social Withdrawal
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03212547
YR: 2017
KY: Premature Birth
AB: Patients and methods: a prospective multicenter (Clínica Alemana de Santiago and Hospital San José) cohort study with comparative and explanatory elements. The study will comprise four periods (during hospitalization and at 2, 6 and 12 months of corrected gestational age). An experimental and a control group will be randomized when a MLP newborn is hospitalized. The experimental group will be composed of late and moderately late preterm infants (MLP) born between 32 to 366 weeks of pregnancy, who will be verbally intervened by the treating physician in outpatient well child consultations at 2, 6 and 12 months corrected age, trough interactive guidance with the aim of potentiating the interaction of the infant with the parents to reduce sustained social withdrawal. Likewise, an analysis of both institutions (Clinica Alemana de Santiago and Hospital San Jose) will be performed to assess the differences between them. The tools that will be applied are the ADBB scale, as dependent variable; the Edinburgh Post‐natal Depression Scale to be applied to parents; the Modified Perinatal Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder Questionnaire and the Revised Impact of Events Scale. During the hospitalization of MLP infants, the painful and invasive procedures to which the infant is subjected will be quantified, as well as neonatal pain, hours of skin‐to‐skin contact, breastfeeding and parental visits. Results relevance and applicability: Efficient early detection and intervention in infants with sustained social withdrawal behavior is essential to prevent problems in their social and emotional development. Assessing sustained social withdrawal using a standardized and simple scale like the ADBB Scale will allow for monitoring the infant and implementing cost‐effective interventions that will benefit him, his family and the society. Identifying the risk groups, i.e. with difficulties in the social and emotional development area, will allow us to optimize the follow‐up and integral support programs according to the infants' health needs as well as to establish a care standard. Intervention Experimental group: the intervention consist in verbal interventions on infants (accompanied by their mothers) who presents sustained social withdrawal detected on the child consultations (at 2, 6 and 12 months of corrected gestational age). The sustained social withdrawal will be assessed by neonatologists certifieds in the assess of Alarm Distress Baby Scale (during the child consultation) and by certifieds external evaluator, by means of a video (8 to 12 minutes of extension) that will be recorder by the neonatologist and assessed by the external evaluator. If the trained neonatologist detect sustained social withdrawal he will perform the verbal intervention during the child consultation. If the neonatologist does not detect sustained social withdrawal during the pediatric check‐up, but the certified external evaluator does when assessing the video, the patient will be contacted and will receive treatment within the time limits described (+‐ 30 days). Also, the verbal intervention is described in a guide for "Promotion of verbal interventions for interaction" , and will be supplemented with a written guideline for parents to promote adequate interaction between parents and infant. Control group: infants will assist at child consultations (at 2, 6 and 12 months of corrected gestational age) whit non trained neonatologists. These neonatologists will record a video that will be assessed by certifieds external evaluators. Infants in the control group won't receive the verbal intervention. However, they will receive a development stimulation guide adapted of the ministerial guides for the stimulation of development of the Ministry of Health of Chile. Infants will be randomized while they are hospitalized in the NICU of Clinica Alemana de Santiago or in the NICU of Hospital San Jose. At the time of randomization, it will be defined whether the infant should attend medical check‐ups at 2, 6 and 12 months of corrected gestational age with a neonatologists trained in Alarm Distress Baby Scale, or with a physician not trained, who will not perform the treatment. Additionally, if during the experimental group medical check‐ups at 2, 6 or 12 months of CGA, the physician trained in ADBB detects social withdrawal or finds any acute morbidity such as acute respiratory infection, fever, dehydration, hyperemesis, diarrhea, prolonged pain or irritability, or some acute condition that might affect the quality of the baby's interactions, he will perform a second assessment with the ADBB scale within 15 days. At the end of the clinical trial, all the infants who present sustained social withdrawal in the medical check‐up at 12 months of corrected gestational age will be offered free assessment and intervention (3 sessions) by the research team of this study.

AB: INTERVENTION: All patients will participate in a half‐day (2.5‐3 hours) face‐to‐face orientation session, including familiarisation with their program materials, procedures, and requirements. Intervention subjects will have the same half‐day orientation with the addition of education into the training program and its associated materials. This session will also involve patients completing a number of written and physical assessments to obtain a baseline assessment. These include: *Anthropometric measures (BMI & waist circumference), 6‐Minute Walk test, 1km Walk Test, Grip Strength Measurement, Sit‐to‐ stand Test (STS), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). *HADS, DASS‐21, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Godin‐Shephard Leisure Time index, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)‐BMT, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐ Fatigue (FACT‐F), Karnofsky Performance Scale, Health Resource Utilization form, EQ‐5D‐5L. Intervention arm: For patients randomised to the intervention group, they will be given an orientation session, internet‐based training and have reinforcement sessions. The orientation session will involve an introduction to mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) and exercise techniques. Baseline physical and psychological measures will be conducted during this session. Trial materials including a CD or USB with voice‐recordings of guided mindfulness tracks for MBSR skill practice, and resistance bands for exercise practice, will be provided. A training and information booklet that includes information on skills, exercises, assessments and goals, practice logs, and appointment schedules will be supplied. Internet‐based Training: Each patient will undergo 6 weekly one‐to‐one sessions with each of the exercise and stress management trainers via the internet (through Skype), for approximately 1hr. Training sessions will be conducted with appropriately trained staff members, such as a psychologist, and an exercise physiologist. During the stress management sessions, common manifestations of anxiety and current cognitive and behavioural coping methods, and the use of stress management techniques to improve well‐being will be discussed. Following MBSR methods, participants will be trained in grounding and mindfulness strategies, and a guided mindfulness practice may be included in each session. Training will be individualised to the patient, depending on their skill level and needs. The exercise training will be comprised of moderate to high intensity aerobic and resistance exercises and stretching. The target during cardio‐vascular exercise is to reach 50‐75% of predicted heart rate reserve, and resistance/strength training with the target of 65–80% of one‐repetition maximum (1‐RM) as defined by the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale (aiming to train at moderate‐to‐high intensities: between ratings of 11 and 15 on the RPE). Training will be adapted to the participant’s initial fitness level, and gradually increase in intensity and duration. For both exercise and stress management skill practice, patients will complete training logs in order to keep track of their progress, and will be provided with recommendations for regular practice, during and at the end of the supervised training period. Reinforcement Phase for Intervention arm: Commencing at 3 months post the internet based training period, patients will have a monthly Skype appointment with a trainer/s for three months. This aims to strengthen behavioural change in the long‐term using methods found to facilitate long‐term behavioural change by identifying values‐based goals and attempting to resolve ambivalence and using motivational interviewing techniques. These techniques have been found to have sustained efficacy in promoting health behaviours in a cost effective manner. Patients will be reminded of their initial goals (GAS/ SMART goals), discussing adherence using a training diary, structured problem solving and value‐based goal setting, to increase their abilities to meet their training goals. Setting SMART goals and a goal attainment scale (GAS) will also function as an objective end point measurement. Sustainability of outcomes will be assessed at 12 and 18 months after the supervised training period.

KY: Cardiovascular Diseases
AB: While the control of cardiovascular risk factors is essential in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), significant treatment gaps exist. For instance, a recent study of Canadian adults filling prescriptions for hypertension or dyslipidemia demonstrated that the majority remained overweight and sedentary despite being at increased risk of developing CVD. In Canada, there is currently a shortage of primary care physicians. Furthermore, many physicians have little training in helping their patients make healthy lifestyle changes such as losing weight or exercising regularly. Non‐medical health professionals such as nurses, dieticians, psychologists, and kinesiologists are well trained in helping individuals modify their behaviour. However, they often do not have access to the health records of their patients or the clinical tools to translate healthy behaviours, such as increasing physical activity, into meaningful health outcomes, such as a reduction in blood lipids, blood glucose, blood pressure, or the future risk of CVD. A web‐based e health program could offer a potential solution to fill the gap and support non‐medical health professionals to become more effective at cardiovascular prevention. The MyHealthCheckUp online wellness program has been designed by a multidisciplinary team to improve the health of individuals at minimal cost using a web‐based approach. The program's scientifically validated disease models have been proven to be effective in clinical interventions to improve the health of individuals with active health issues, such as high cholesterol, hypertension, and obesity, as well as low‐risk individuals who want to reduce their risk of future problems [2, 3]. The website also features educational modules and physical activity, weight loss, stress management, and sleep hygiene challenges. The educational modules cover topics such as blood pressure management, smoking cessation, stress management, and weight loss. The physical activity challenge is designed to optimize health and wellness by promoting walking and other physical activity. As individuals or teams, participants track their physical activity online, and compete against each other or an avatar using a virtual route. The weight loss challenge is designed to promote healthy weight management through food and physical activity tracking as well as online information regarding lifestyle modification. The stress and sleep challenges are designed to help manage stress and improve sleep duration and quality. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a web‐based e‐health intervention, used by non‐medical health professionals, to improve the management of cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, dyslipidemia, cigarette smoking, excess body weight, sedentary lifestyle, as well as sleep and stress problems. Participants will be sent to a website where they will determine if they meet the eligibility criteria. If a subject meets the eligibility criteria, they will be assigned to be further evaluated at the McGill Comprehensive Health Improvement Program (CHIP) by one of the following health professionals: a nurse, dietician, kinesiologist, or psychologist (25 subjects assigned to each health professional). Half of the participants will be randomly assigned to start the intervention immediately (intervention group) and the other half will start the intervention after the 3‐month assessment (wait‐list control). Initial Visit (approximately 45 minutes) At the initial visit with the health professional, informed consent will be obtained and the following information will be collected: demographics, medical history and concomitant medication, height, weight, waist circumference, sitting blood pressure, and cholesterol and glucose blood tests Participants will also complete the following questionnaires: The Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies‐Depression Scale. Wait‐List Control group The participants who have been randomly assigned to the wait‐list control group will be given general documentation regarding healthy eating and physical activity from Health Canada (usual care) during the initial visit with the health professional. After a waiting period of 3 months, these participants will undergo a re‐evaluation with their health professional and will then start the intervention. Intervention using the e‐health Website All participants will be given a unique temporary user name and password to access the MyHealthCheckUp website which is designed to assess and manage cardiovascular risk factors. They will also be provided with a pedometer for tracking daily steps. The health professionals will provide an overview of the website and discuss with the participants their specific goals. After signing on to the site, participants will have the opportunity to complete disease specific health risk assessments. Participants will have access to educational modules with information relevant to a better understanding of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes and the impact of lifestyle changes. Participants will also be enrolled in one of two lifestyle management challenges designed to motivate the user to engage in regular exercise or lose weight. Other challenges will be available after one of these initial challenges has been completed. The challenges provide education and tracking tools to facilitate the participant's monitoring of their own progress. Follow‐up Visits All participants will be scheduled for follow‐up visits at CHIP at 3 and 6 months to have their cardiovascular risk factors re‐assessed which includes blood tests and anthropometric information as evaluated in the initial session. The psychosocial measures (stress, sleep and depressed mood) will also be re‐administered at the 3 and 6 month follow‐up. All intervention subjects will also be contacted by their study health professional at months 1, 2, 4, and 5 either by phone or email (participant's preference) to discuss progress, barriers, and answer any questions. Wait control subjects will not be contacted by their health professional during the 3 month wait period. Qualitative Evaluation of the e‐health Intervention Two focus groups, each with 10‐12 patients, will be held following the intervention phase of this study. These focus group discussions will be facilitated to elicit in‐depth feedback from users related to the website's acceptability and usability and to identify barriers and facilitators to using e‐health approaches to modify lifestyle behaviours. The focus groups will be conducted by a trained moderator. A brief patient satisfaction questionnaire will be done at the end of the study to qualitatively assess their satisfaction of the MyHealthCheckUp website.

TI: Virtual Fitness Buddy Ecosystem
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03524183
YR: 2018
AB: Childhood obesity poses a critical public health concern and chronically remains as one of the strongest predictors of obesity as an adult. Scientific evidence has demonstrated that daily physical activity (PA) is imperative in preventing the onset of obesity. The outpour of academic and professional interest has increased the public awareness of the risks related to obesity (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers) as well as the importance of PA. However, studies show that the rising prevalence of childhood obesity has not faltered since 1999. Many existing PA interventions show short‐term impact, but have failed to demonstrate longer‐term efficacy in sustaining the changes in PA over time—a gap this project aims to address. One important, yet commonly overlooked, limitation of existing PA interventions is the negative impact of extrinsic rewards, such as points, grades, and badges, which are often used in health promotion interventions to incentivize children for engaging with the program. Children become motivated to excel in obtaining the extrinsic rewards rather than learning the intrinsic benefits of the intervention. Consequently, these types of interventions have limited effects that may disappear altogether when they stop receiving extrinsic rewards. Another critical limitation of existing PA interventions related to the use of extrinsic rewards is that the focus on "beating the system" by obtaining extrinsic rewards decontextualizes the intervention from the child's everyday life. This is an isolating experience for the child, taking him or her away from existing social support (e.g., parents) and left to his or her devices to engage in PA, based solely on the motivation from extrinsic rewards. Guided by the frameworks of social ecological theory and self‐determination theory, we propose a paradigm‐shifting intervention through an engaging, game‐like platform that incorporates intrinsic reward systems by harnessing the power of technology to connect people and devices to promote PA in children. The Virtual Fitness Buddy (VFB) Ecosystem was designed to encourage children to embrace PA as a lifestyle change that can be sustained over time rather than a means to gain points. The Ecosystem meets this goal by leveraging one of the most influential existing social relationships in children's lives, the parent‐child relationship. Using consumer‐grade technological devices, such as mobile phones, the Ecosystem allows parents to stay involved in the intervention and support their children's PA efforts even when they cannot be with their children. In addition, a virtual pet, designed to mimic human‐pet relationships in the physical world, will guide children to set and meet PA goals and offer tailored support. Using technology to amplify the power of existing social relationships, children will learn to embrace PA as a lifestyle change while supported by their parents and the virtual pet within the Ecosystem. Because the intervention is embedded in the context of children's everyday lives, our preliminary findings demonstrated the potential of the Ecosystem to elicit high levels of engagement and excitement from both children and parents over a 3‐day intervention period. The next critical question is whether the Ecosystem can maintain children and parents' engagement over longer periods of time, yielding sustainable changes in health behavior and lifestyle choices that were initiated by the Ecosystem. In collaboration with YMCA, 720 children and 720 parents in 24 afterschool programs will be randomly assigned to treatment and control groups in a cluster‐randomized controlled trial. Afterschool programs in the treatment group will receive the Ecosystem intervention for 3‐months; afterschool programs in the control group will not experience the Ecosystem (but will receive the standard of care). All children will complete baseline assessments, a 3‐month posttest, and a 6‐month and 12‐month follow up. Parents and children will provide self‐report data on their perceived social support, motivation, and PA self‐efficacy. PA will be assessed with activity monitors, which children will wear throughout the project. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that at the 3‐month, 6 month, and 12‐month assessments, children assigned to the Ecosystem will evince higher levels of moderate‐to‐vigorous intensity PA than children in the control group. Auxiliary Aim 1. For the treatment group only, test the engagement of parents and children over the 3‐month intervention through tracking the usage frequency and duration of their interactions through the Ecosystem. Aim 2. Test the parent and child mechanisms of change. Specifically, we hypothesize that children and parents in the treatment group will report higher levels of motivation, PA self‐efficacy, and perceived social support at the 3‐month, 6 month, and 12‐month follow up compared to control children. Moderators of change, such as the child's age and gender will also be analyzed. The Virtual Fitness Buddy Ecosystem represents a new generation of technology‐mediated health interventions for children, which integrates fun and engaging technology into existing social systems, to promote sustainable lifestyle changes through the intrinsic reward of social support. Because the Ecosystem is a cost‐ and labor‐effective solution that integrates consumer‐grade technology with low barriers for continued use, it has the potential for rapid diffusion and widespread public health impact.

YR: 2016
AB: INTERVENTION: Participants are randomised to one of two groups with an allocation ratio of 2:1 (intervention:TAU) using an electronic randomisation list which has been computer generated by a statistician independent from the research team, using a programme written in STATA. The list is stratified by site using random permuted blocks. The lists are password‐protected, and can only be accessed (and allocations provided) by two team members from an unrelated study. Intervention arm: The six‐session DREAMS START intervention is manual‐based and delivered to carers by trained and clinically supervised psychology graduates in the participants’ own homes. Each session lasts about one hour and takes place approximately weekly. The carer fills in their own experiences and agreed strategies to try out between sessions, and keeps the personalised manual. The last session will summarise what worked and which strategies the carer intends to continue using in the future. The manual includes: 1. Information about sleep and circadian processes and how sleep and brain function change with ageing and dementia 2. Analyses of the person with dementia’s reading from the acti‐watch 3. A plan for increasing light and activity 4. Relaxation exercises Control arm: Participants receive treatment as usual (TAU) for six weeks which is delineated by the Client Service Receipt Inventory. This is expected to vary between trusts and also according to individual patient needs, but to be in line with the NICE pathways guidelines for dementia. Services are based around the person with dementia. Treatment is medical, psychological and social. Thus, it consists of assessment, diagnosis, risk assessment and information. These include referral to dementia navigators, medication, cognitive stimulation therapy, START (in some trusts), practical support (social services provided); risk plans, for example telecare, driving information to the Driver and Vehicle Registry Agency (DVLA), medical identification (ID) brace CONDITION: Specialty: Dementias and neurodegeneration, Primary sub‐specialty: Dementia; UKCRC code/ Disease: Neurological/ Other degenerative diseases of the nervous system ; Mental and Behavioural Disorders ; Dementia PRIMARY OUTCOME: 1.

AB: Introduction Pomalidomide and low‐dose dexamethasone (PomDex) are approved for relapsed and refractory myeloma (RRMM) with Overall Response Rates of about 30%, including durable remissions. Combining PomDex with biologic agents can improve response, but there are currently no markers to predict which patients benefit from the addition of drugs to PomDex alone. Myeloma UK (MUK) seven is a multi‐center UK phase II trial that is designed to generate evidence for improved outcomes and treatment stratification in RRMM by: 1) building a bio‐repository for molecular characterization of RRMM and discovery of predictive markers for response 2) patient randomisation to Cyclophosphamide‐PomDex (CyPomDex) or PomDex to investigate if the cost‐effective CyPomDex combination increases progression free survival compared to PomDex 3) a flexible design that allows addition of trial arms with other promising PomDex combinations. We report high patient and investigator bio‐sampling adherence and first comprehensive genetic profiling results in RRMM using a novel molecular assay platform. Methods MUKseven (NCT02406222) will in total recruit 250 RRMM patients who are currently randomised 1:1 to CyPomDex or PomDex therapy. Registered patients undergo bone marrow sampling at screening, Cycle 1 Day 14, Cycle 4 Day 14 and at disease progression, and peripheral blood sampling on Cycle 1 Day 1. Patient consent includes mandatory bio‐sampling at screening. Material is shipped to central laboratories for processing and storage of CD138‐purified (>95%) MM tumor and non‐tumor bone marrow microenvironment cells. Participants are currently recruited from over 30 NHS Hospitals in the MUK Early Phase Clinical Network. Digital multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification (dMLPA®; MRC Holland) is a novel assay for high‐throughput genome‐wide copy number aberration (CNA) profiling. The MM specific D006 assay contains 160 probes that interrogate regions frequently affected by CNA in MM, including hotspots CDKN2C, CKS1B, MYC and regions encoding for therapeutic targets such as MCL1 or SLAMF7. In addition, 219 probes are distributed over all chromosomal arms and inform a virtual karyogram. The targeted design allows for analysis of over 80 patient samples in a single MiSeq (Illumina) run, using 10‐20 ng DNA input material. Results Between March 2016 and July 2017 a total of 83 patients were randomised to MUKseven with a median follow up of 6 cycles (1‐13). Bone marrow material was received by central laboratories for all patients (100%) at screening, 69/79 (87.3%) at Cycle 1 day 14, 47/54 (87.0%) at Cycle 4 day 14 and 13/29 (44.8%) at disease progression. Peripheral blood was received for 73/79 (92.4%) on Cycle 1 Day 1. These return rates are higher than those reported for recent commercial trials. Of importance, for 52% of patients, matched bone marrow samples from earlier disease stages collected as part of UK academic research studies were available. We profiled the first 81 RRMM samples from trial entry with dMLPA and compared CNA frequency to a recently published newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) cohort which was assessed with MLPA (Shah V, Leukemia 2017). We found significantly more focal bi‐allelic CNA of driver lesions in RRMM than in NDMM (P = 0.002). These included homozygous deletions of CDKN2C (6.2 vs 1.9%) and RB1 (3.7 vs 0.8%), amplifications of MYC (8.6 vs 2.3%), and heterozygous losses of TP53 (16.0 vs 9.6%). There were significantly more RRMM patients with one or more of the following bi‐allelic changes: CDKN2C, RB1 or CYLD homozygous loss, or 1q amplification (18.5 vs 8.2%; P = 0.007), and 3.7% of patients in the RRMM cohort showed more than one bi‐allelic change. We identified frequent homozygous deletions in NFκB pathway genes such as CYLD (4.9%), and recurrent amplifications of therapeutic targets like MCL1 and SLAMF7 on chromosome 1 (8.6% amplifications). The trial is recruiting and profiling of additional cases as well as longitudinal profiling of cases with material from earlier disease stages is ongoing. Conclusion We demonstrate highly successful conduct of a multi‐center biomarker discovery trial by the Myeloma UK Clinical Trial Network and the UK Myeloma Research Alliance. Our results demonstrate that bi‐allelic CNA increase significantly in RRMM and some of these may help guide therapy. Recruitment and analyses of additional cases enrolled into MUKseven are ongoing and updated data will be presented at the meeting.

SO: Http://www.who.int/trialsearch/trial2.aspx? Trialid=ntr5055
YR: 2015
AB: INTERVENTION: The intervention consists of eight weeks of complementary exercise therapy done with a caregiver, next to the usual therapy. 33 standardized exercises are available, that can be customized per patient and caregiver to the individual situation. These exercises were devised in collaboration with movement scientists and physical therapists and were shown to be feasible and safe in preliminary informal exploratory patient‐caregiver try‐outs. The exercises are presented in a smartphone/ tablet app with video's and voiceover. Regular reminders to exercise can be given by the app. (see appendix for examples) The exercises are aimed at improving skills related to walking ability like sitting, standing and making transfers, or are supporting exercises to improve mobility, strength and balance. The patient and their caregiver are asked to do the exercises minimally 5 times a week for 30 minutes on at least both weekend days or the equivalent dosage with an adopted schedule. When the intervention is correctly performed patients will have a surplus of 150 minutes of caregiver mediated therapy a week. Patients and their caregiver will have a weekly session with a trained therapist. In this session, the participating couple will be instructed as to which exercises should be performed safely during the next week and evaluate the exercises done last week. All patients and caregivers will be supported by a handbook with instructions. The program starts when the patient is admitted in one of the participating centres. When the discharge date of the patient is earlier than the finishing of the program, the program continues at home with monitoring from the treating therapist. The participants in the control group will receive usual care according to the Dutch guidelines for patients with stroke and the Royal Dutch Guidelines of Physical Therapy.

AB: Background: Obesity is increasingly a worldwide problem of epidemic proportions (Roberto et al., 2015) and it often shows comorbidity with binge eating disorder (BED), a mental health disorder characterized by uncontrolled consumption of abnormally large amounts of food in a discrete period of time in absence of compensatory weight control methods, such as purging, fasting, or excessive exercise (APA, 2013). Compared with obese individuals without BED, those with BED report greater functional impairment and lower quality of life, as well as significantly greater levels of psychiatric comorbidity (Wilson, 2011). Moreover, obese individuals with BED are more likely to dropout of weight loss treatment and demonstrate lower behavior change self‐efficacy than those without BED (Rieger, Wilfley, Stein, Marino, & Crow, 2005). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most established and researched psychotherapy treatment for BED and obesity (Grilo, 2017). However, research has revealed that CBT has only shown modest success in long‐term reduction of BED symptomatology and limited efficacy in promoting weight loss (Vocks et al., 2010). Therefore, it is important to examine alternative treatments to CBT for increased effectiveness in improving BED symptomology, weight loss, and weight loss maintenance (Castelnuovo et al., 2015). Empirical studies have shown brief strategic therapy (BST) to be clinically effective in treating several psychological disorders, including BED (Nardone & Brook Barbieri, 2010). Also, telemedicine offers advantages in terms of cost and accessibility and has proven effective in promoting weight loss, treatment adherence, and treatment retention among people who are overweight or obese (Sorgente et al., 2017). Objectives: The present randomized control trial (RCT) is amed to evaluate the statistical and clinical effectiveness of BST compared to CBT, one year after a two‐phase inpatient and outpatient telemedicine treatment for BED. Methods: Obese Italian women with BED were recruited from a self‐referred inpatient treatment program for weight loss (n=60) and randomly assigned to either the BST treatment condition (n=30) or CBT treatment condition (n=30). Inpatient psychotherapy sessions were conducted in person and outpatient telemedicine psychotherapy sessions were conducted over the telephone. Participants were blinded regarding treatment allocation. Treatment duration for both conditions was 7 months. As part of the 1‐month inpatient phase, participants in both conditions attended an inpatient weight loss treatment program including eight face‐to‐face 45‐min psychotherapy sessions (2 per week). As part of the 6‐month outpatient telemedicine phase, participants received eight telephone psychotherapy sessions (2 sessions per month the first two months after discharge and one session per month for the subsequent four months). Outcomes were assessed at pretreatment (T1), inpatient discharge (T2 ‐ approximately 1 month after the pretreatment measure), posttreatment (T3 ‐ approximately 7 months after the pretreatment measure), 6‐month follow‐up (T4), and 1‐year follow‐up (T5). Multilevel growth curve modeling was used to estimate the average pretreatment levels and growth trajectories from baseline to one year after treatment for the following outcomes: average weekly binge episode frequency, weight, and global functioning. Clinical significance was calculated for each outcome by identifying the proportion of participants who demonstrated meaningful change from pretreatment to 12‐month posttreatment (Kendall, 1999). Results: Preliminary analyses for between‐condition differences indicated there were no significant baseline differences on outcome variables or demographic characteristics between BST participants and CBT participants. BST average weekly binge episode frequency, weight and participant global functioning (as measure by the assessed by the Outcome Questionnaire ‐ OQ‐45) were lower than that of CBT at posttreatment, 6‐month follow‐up, and 1‐year fol‐ low‐up. BST was statistically and clinically superior to CBT in improving binge eating frequency, weight, and global functioning. Conclusions: Examining BED given the current obesity epidemic is an important area of study. Findings suggest that stepped‐care telemedicine BST approach is statistically and clinically more effective than CBT in treating BED, promoting weight loss, and improving global functioning among obese women one year after treatment. The most likely reason for the results may be the differing BED symptom conceptualization and mechanisms of change behind the BST and CBT interventions: CBT provides problem‐focused treatment aimed at helping clients control binge eating by restructuring associated cognitive distortions and replacing maladaptive behavioral patterns with more adaptive eating behavioral patterns, while BST provides solution‐focused treatment aimed at helping clients shift the dysfunctional perceptive‐reactive system around restricting by replacing dysfunctional attempted solutions with more functional solutions often through paradoxical intervention. Additional research are needed to determine if BST is an empirically supported treatment for BED and obesity, and to confirm the effectiveness of the stepped‐care model by comparing BST treatment across various treatment delivery modes.

YR: 2018
AB: INTERVENTION: In this pilot study we aim to test the components of a personalised electronic self‐management support intervention to support patient‐centred goal attainment and secondary prevention following stroke. This novel support program comprises: structured and comprehensive patient‐centred goal setting conducted over the phone in survivors of stroke recruited from the Australian Stroke Survivor Clinical Registry (AuSCR) 1‐2 years (medium time 16 months; Q1:12 months to Q3:18 months) from admission. All participants will be assisted by a researcher to develop 2‐3 goals for recovery or secondary prevention of stroke, via telephone. Goals are chosen from a menu specifically developed for the study consisting of 5 major categories and 32 sub‐categories related to the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health and secondary prevention. For example they may select to address secondary prevention of stroke and establish a goal directed at controlling blood pressure. Once the goals have been established, participants will then be randomised. The intervention group will receive electronic health messages sent via the iVERVE messaging system and aligned to their goals over 4 weeks. Prior to being sent electronic messages to support attainment of their goals, they receive 2 general administrative messages e.g. "Hi #PREF_NAME, welcome to the iVERVE study. We will be contacting you using this number. Please add 'iVERVE' to your contacts. Thanks". Electronic messages will then be scheduled over the 4 week intervention period. They will be personalised (use preferred name where possible) and tailored (aligned to stage of readiness and baseline characteristics including disability level, where relevant) e.g. Message for a goal to improve memory: “Hi #PREF_NAME, keeping a dairy of appointments or a notebook may help you remember important information.” The format and content of the messages are the same regardless of whether sent via SMS or email. They will also receive one or two general motivational message per week e.g. "Hi #PREF_NAME, the beginning is always the hardest part. iVERVE is going to help you find your get up and go! You can do it!" The number of messages sent will be dependent on the number of goals established but the maximum number per week will be 7. The mode of delivery is chosen by the participant. Some messages will contain hyperlinks to reliable and trusted websites for participants to obtain further information. One reminder message regarding the the final follow‐up assessment will be sent after the 4 week intervention, using the participants preferred method of delivery. CONDITION: Stroke PRIMARY OUTCOME: Group differences in Goal attainment Scale as assessed by changes in the baseline and follow‐up mean T‐score ; Number of participants satisfied with the program using a study specific questionnaire with a combination of questions seeking responses on a 5 point Likert scale and open ended questions Number of participants that complete the trial SECONDARY OUTCOME: Cost of maintaining the iVERVE interface and sending messages assessed by accessing program operational financial data ; Group difference in Health related quality of life will be assessed by the EuroQoL‐5D. Group differences in emotional status assessed by the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).

AB: Due to a 50% increase in HIV‐related deaths in youth from 2005 to 2012, there is a critical need for research to address health disparities in youth ages 18 to 29 years old living with HIV (YLWH) and for the tailoring of healthcare delivery to their unique and complex health needs. YLWH experience worse clinical outcomes than adults including high rates of mental health and substance use challenges that impact their medical care and adherence. Many YLWH have sub‐optimal engagement in HIV care, including missed HIV provider visits and routine lab work. The consequence of suboptimal adherence in YLWH is increased risk of HIV transmission and a future generation of immunodeficient adults with drug‐resistant virus. In response to this critical public health dilemma, the researchers propose to develop a telehealth intervention for YLWH focused on addressing engagement in HIV care, mental health, and substance use challenges. Telehealth holds promise in overcoming barriers to clinic attendance or research participation, such as transportation difficulties or HIV‐related stigma concerns. Text messaging has also been used successfully for Antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and virologic suppression in African settings and has been examined in youth. The investigators have chosen these technology‐based methods due to the presence of data supporting their efficacy, feasibility and acceptability, promise for future dissemination, limited research in YLWH, and ability to tailor based on patients' unique health needs. While these technologies can act on specific barriers to engagement in HIV care, they are inversely related in cost, burden to patient and provider, and intensity. Existing interventions for YLWH have been adapted to create the Youth to Text or Telehealth for Engagement in HIV Care Intervention (Y2TEC) through text messaging and teleconferencing (telehealth). The Y2TEC telehealth intervention uses problem‐solving therapy, a strengths‐based orientation, and motivational interviewing to help participants identify and resolve potential barriers to engagement in HIV care and other barriers to overall wellness. Consisting of twelve 20‐30 minute sessions with a trained social worker using a menu of structured sessions. Each session will focus on a specific topic as it relates to healthcare engagement and wellness, such as substance use, family support, or social support. The curriculum is designed increase engagement in HIV care and reduce viral loads. To achieve these outcomes, the behaviors most commonly targeted through the problem‐solving activities will be related to medication adherence, attending clinic visits, and completing labs. At the end of the study, the investigators will explore feasibility and acceptability using quantitative and qualitative methods. Participants will complete quantitative surveys at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and study completion, as well as qualitative exit interviews conducted over the phone. Participants will consent to the study in person and will be randomized into one of two condition groups to receive the following: Group A: participants will immediately receive 1 brief counseling intervention in‐person and 11 subsequent weekly sessions delivered remotely via video‐conference and weekly text messaging. Then cross over to a waiting period receiving text messages for 12 weeks. Group B: Participants in the wait‐list after consent and receive text messaging only for a period of 12 weeks then will receive a revised version of the intervention for 12 weeks with all sessions completed remotely via video‐conference and text message. The aims of this study are: 1. Employ: (1) mixed methods research to assess engagement in HIV care, technology use, substance use, and challenges with current systems of care among YLWH (18‐29 years), (2) qualitative research to examine the perceptions of clinicians/managers of clinics and organizations serving YLWH on available referral services, system‐wide barriers to care or referrals to substance use treatment, and age‐specific challenges to patient care. 2. Develop a technology‐based intervention for improving mental health and reducing substance for delivery in YLWH based on prior data and information learned in Aim 1. 3. Examine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical outcomes of the technology‐based intervention among YLWH on improved engagement in HIV care and mental health, and reduced substance use. The investigators hypothesize that the Y2TEC intervention will be feasible and acceptable for YLWH. Our secondary hypotheses: H1: Antiretroviral adherence, engagement in care, and CD4+ cell count will be higher and HIV RNA levels will be lower in the intervention arm (Group A) relative to the wait‐list arm (Group B) at 4 months. H2: Among those enrolling in the study with a detectable HIV RNA, there will be a minimum of 1log10 reduction in HIV RNA at 4 months among the intervention arm and at 8 months among the wait‐list arm relative to baseline and 4 months, respectively. H3: Among those enrolling in the study with an undetectable HIV RNA, there will be a maintenance of virologic suppression at 4 months among the intervention arm and at 8 months among the wait‐list control arm relative to baseline and 4 months, respectively. The investigators postulate parallel hypotheses for self‐reported ART adherence, appointment attendance based on medical records, and self‐reported composite of engagement in care with mean levels of these variables being highest in the Telehealth arm and lowest in the control arm. Conversely, the screener for substance use (CRAFFT score) should be highest in the control arm and lowest in the Telehealth arm. If this innovative intervention is found to be feasible and acceptable, it can be scaled up for a multi‐site adaptive randomized trial.

KY: Colorectal Neoplasms
AB: Study setting The Danish national colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programme was implemented in Denmark in March 2014. All citizens aged 50‐74 years are invited to take up CRC screening biennially, however, the first prevalence round is carried out during a four year period (2014‐2017). During the this period, citizens are invited according to month of birth, except citizens aged 49 who are invited just before they turn 50 and citizens turning 75 who are invited prior to their 75th birthday, if they were not invited earlier in the program. Politically and organisationally the CRC screening programme is nationally directed, but the administrative responsibility is placed within the five regions in Denmark. The Department of Public Health Programmes is responsible for the administration of the CRC screening programme in the Central Denmark Region (CDR). The CDR has 1.3 million citizens (23% of the total population) of which roughly 390 000 citizens are 50‐74 years of age. The citizens receive an invitation, containing a screening kit. The screening test (collection of a stool sample) is performed in the citizen's own home. The stool sample is sent to the clinical biochemical department at the hospital. If the citizens do not return a stool sample within 45 days after receiving the invitation, a screening reminder is received. Citizens, who still do not return a stool sample, are automatically referred to the next screening round, and will receive another invitation two years later. Citizens with a negative test are automatically referred to the next screening round. Citizens with a positive test are invited to have a colonoscopy. Since 2010, national digitisation has occurred in Denmark. Hence, communication to and from Danish authorities occur via digital mail, in the public email platform E‐Boks. Danish residents are obliged to order a digital signature (NemID) which is used as a shared log‐in for E‐boks, public and private online self‐services, and online banking. Only disabled citizens (e.g. physical or cognitive impairment) or citizens unable to satisfactorily identify themselves (e.g. migrants with no permanent resident permit) can be exempted from ordering a NemID. As of May 2016 more than 5 million Danish citizens (87.5% of the entire population including children) have access to E‐boks. Exemption from digital communication has been granted to 9.8% of Danish Residents aged 45‐74 years. All letters in the CRC screening programme are sent by digital mail, except from invitation letters, which contains a screening kit and are sent by conventional mail. Citizens exempt from digital communication receive conventional letters via a remote printing system. All invitations and reminders in the screening program are sent out based on lists generated in the administrative CRC screening program IT system, which is linked to the daily updated Danish Civil Registration System, in which all Danish citizens are registered with unique civil registration numbers (CRN) assigned at birth or at immigration. The department of public health programmes is administratively responsible for the screening program IT system. Study flow The study population will be identified based on data extraction from the Danish Civil Registration System. 10 000 citizens 50‐74 years old, living in the Central Denmark Region born in December (invited for CRC screening through October/November/December 2017) and 5 000 citizens 50‐74 years old, living in the Central Denmark Region born in October (invited for CRC screening in January/February 2017) are identified. The 10 000 citizens born in December comprise the population to be randomized (study arm 1 and 2). This group of citizens will receive a baseline questionnaire at the beginning of the study period (before receiving screening invitations). Non‐respondents receive a questionnaire reminder after two weeks. After four weeks a telephone call is made offering filling out the questionnaire via telephone. Respondents (at six weeks after receiving the questionnaire) are included in the study and randomized into two groups (intervention and control group). All included citizens are monitored in the screening program IT system, in order to identify date of screening invitation and date of screening reminder. Citizens in study arm one (intervention group) receive a decision aid (DA) on the same day as the screening reminder or the next day. Both groups receive a follow‐up questionnaire three months after the date of invitation for the last citizen invited in the study population. Questionnaire reminders are sent out at two and four weeks, and deadline for questionnaire response will be after six weeks. The 5 000 citizens born in October comprise a historic cohort of citizens invited to CRC screening. This population receives only one questionnaire 3‐4 months after they received their screening invitations. In this survey reminders will be sent out at two and four weeks. Respondents (at six weeks) will be included in the study. All contact with the study participants in this study will occur via digital communication or by postal mail via remote printing system. Hence all questionnaires, survey reminders, and DAs will be sent out first via digital mail. However, it is crucial to reach a high questionnaire participation rate in order to obtain generalizable results. The aim is to reach a survey participation rate of no less than 50% for baseline and 80% for follow‐up. When questionnaire data has been collected, date of screening invitation and screening reminder will be collected from the screening program IT system along with the date of test registration laboratory and the test result. Questionnaire data and IT system data are both uploaded to Statistics Denmark, where socio‐demographic data are appended for the data management and data analysis. Materials Three different questionnaires will be administered in this trial: The baseline questionnaire, the follow‐up questionnaire, and the questionnaire for the historic cohort. The questionnaires comprise five different scales. The worry scale, the knowledge scale, the attitudes scale, the decisional conflict scale, and the health literacy scale, developed by the European Union consortium (HLS‐EU‐Q16). The DA is an online tool. The web‐based design opens up possibilities to feature more advanced functions, e.g. questions for the participant during the process, and a summary of answers at the end. Further a web‐based design has lower running costs, and can be provided as a link via the E‐boks platform. The development of the DA took place in five steps: (1) scoping of the DA; (2) formation of the steering group (the research group); (3) Design phase, in which the prototype was developed based on previous research by the research group; (4) Alpha testing, including citizens and experts evaluating design and usability and a peer review by experts and citizens, evaluating content and usability; (5) Beta testing, including citizens, evaluating feasibility, comprehensibility and usability. The development took place as an iterative process, in which the DA was revise between each step based on the experiences gained from the previous step. Background data on educational level, family income, occupation, marital status, and ethnicity will be obtained from Statistics Denmark when questionnaire data have been collected. Statistical methods All statistical analyses are going to be carried out in Stata/SE 14 (STATACorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA), stratifying according to gender. All estimates will be presented with 95% confidence intervals, and all analyses will be carried out on a 5% significance level. Since citizens with lower educational attainment (LEA) are the target group of this study, all citizens with medium or higher educational attainment will be excluded from the statistical analyses. Pearson's chi‐square test will be used to test differences in demographic characteristic distribution between respondents and non‐respondents as well as between the study arms in order to test whether the randomisation succeeds. Differences in distributions of responses to the outcomes (informed choice, yes/no; Adequate knowledge, yes/no; mean level of decisional conflict; mean level of decisional support; mean level of effectiveness of decision made; mean level of worries; and participation, yes/no) in the study arms are being analysed using the independent sample t test for continuous variables and Pearson's chi‐square test for categorical variables. Further, the relative risk (RR) will be estimated for all dichotomous outcomes using a 2x2 table with study arm 2 and historic study arm as the reference, respectively. If randomisation does not succeed in producing groups with similar baseline characteristics, a logistic regression will be completed for categorical outcomes and a linear regression for continuous outcomes in order to estimate an adjusted odds ratio (OR) as a value to be interpreted as a RR. All analyses will be conducted as intention to treat (ITT) analyses, in which all LEA citizens will remain in the study arms to which they were first assigned. Power calculations Every month 9 900 citizens are invited to participate in CRC screening in the CDR. On average, 47% of these (4 600) do not return a stool sample within 45 days, and they receive a screening reminder. It is expected that at least 1 200 (26% of the population, according to Statistics Denmark) have LEA. Power calculations (considering a 5% significance level and an 80% statistical power) based on being able to detect expected differences of the outcomes of 22% (proportion making an informed choice), 14% (proportion having a positive attitude towards CRC screening), 16% (proportion participating in CRC screening) and 2.4 (difference in mean score of knowledge) between the groups (as observed in previous studies) indicate that 200 citizens with LEA needs to be included in every group thereby a total of 770 citizens who receive a screening reminder. Analyses are stratified by gender; therefore the study population is doubled to 1 540 participants in every group, so that adequate power is retained to assess the effect of the DA in both genders. With an expected participation rate of 58% for baseline questionnaire (study arm 1+2) and an expected participation rate of 80% in the follow‐up questionnaire in study arms 1 and 2, 10 000 citizens who will be invited for screening (5 000 in each study arm and hence an allocation ratio of 1:1) are included. In the historic study arm a 50% participation rate is expected (two written reminders, no telephone calls), hence we 5 000 citizens, who will be invited for screening, are included.

KY: Anxiety Disorders; Depression; Depressive Disorder
AB: Abstract: There is a growing demand for mental health services on college campuses. At the same time there has been a dramatic surge in development of mobile apps for mental health. Given the widespread popularity and utilization of mobile apps in the college‐age population, there is an opportunity to leverage these tools to improve services. The study aims to evaluate the effects of a mobile mental health app on reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety for students awaiting their first visit at Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services (CAMHS), and secondly on enhancing recovery after beginning treatment. The feasibility and acceptability of a mobile app intervention with this population will also be assessed, as well as the ways through which the mobile app may contribute to improvement in depression and anxiety among students such as change in perceived social support for students using a mobile social support app. Specific Aims: Untreated or under‐treated depression and anxiety in college‐age students has tremendous costs for the individual, the larger community and society at large, with the worst, fatal outcome of suicide leading to devastating consequences for college communities. 64% of young adults who are no longer in college are not attending college because of a mental health related condition and the frequency that students in treatment report having "seriously considered suicide" has increased by almost 40% in the last five years. Despite these facts, still only 25% of students with a mental health concern seek treatment. Technological innovations such as mobile apps hold promise to improve access to care, de‐stigmatize treatment and potentially alleviate demand on over‐burdened service centers. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness and feasibility of use of these mobile platforms. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop better research modalities for evaluating mobile apps and to elucidate the specific features that are effective at reducing symptoms and are acceptable in this population in order to improve care and inform novel treatment approaches. In this study, participants seeking mental health services at a university health center will receive a mobile social support app. The investigators hypothesize that receiving immediate access to a mobile, anonymous social support app while waiting for an appointment and during treatment will be feasible and acceptable to young adults seeking mental health services, and will yield promising results for improving outcomes of depression and anxiety in comparison to those in the control group. The pilot deign will address the following aims: Aim1: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of providing college students access to a mobile social support app to augment available mental health services within a university health center. Aim 2: Evaluate the potential effectiveness of a mobile social support app at reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety for students seeking mental health services. Aim 3: Test the feasibility of conducting a fully remote, digital trial with college students seeking mental health services with randomization to a mobile social support app. Background and Significance: There is a mental health crisis on college campuses across the country. 64% of young adults who are no longer in college are not attending college because of a mental health related condition and the frequency that students in treatment report having "seriously considered suicide" has increased by almost 40% in the last five years. The demand for counseling services has also grown at least five times faster than average student enrollment. This has led to a significant shortage of mental health services for students. Considering the ubiquity of mobile phone usage, particularly in this population ‐over 86% of young adults aged 18‐29 owns a smart phone—there is significant interest in the use of mobile phone apps as a powerful alternate care delivery platform. Additionally, the number of mobile mental health apps is exponentially growing with currently thousands of mental health apps available for download on the Apple or Google Marketplaces. Given their widespread use, mobile apps have the potential to reach people outside of the traditional care model and allow people to use these tools when they need them, and as often as they like without having to wait for a mental health professional. There are numerous potential advantages of mobile health applications, such as continuous availability and immediate support, anonymity, customizable content and self‐guided treatment approaches. Additionally, these approaches hold promise for increasing access to care particularly for those in remote areas and traditionally hard‐to‐reach groups. These tools have also been seen as ways to increase service capacity and efficiency, reduce other barriers to face‐to‐face help seeking such as stigma and shame, and may be particularly well suited to young people who may be more accepting of technological approaches. However, despite the growing number of apps available and the consensus that these innovations hold promise for expanding mental health care delivery, the evidence base for their efficacy remains unclear and research is significantly lagging behind app development. A review of mHealth apps for the most prevalent conditions identified by the WHO identified more than 1536 apps for depression, but only 32 associated published articles. Many mobile platforms developed by commercial companies are widely utilized but have not been adequately evaluated to determine their effectiveness. In a scoping review of the literature on mobile apps for mental health in adolescents, only two RCTs were identified and both failed to demonstrate a significant effect on intended outcomes. A large meta‐analysis conducted recently on smartphone interventions for depressive symptoms in adults found a moderate positive effect on depressive symptoms, however, the subgroup analyses found that the effects of smart‐ phone interventions were substantially larger when compared to inactive (g= 0.56) than active (g=0.22) control conditions. Further, there is a broad spectrum of features ranging from entirely self‐guided tools, mixed approaches that combine self‐guided tools with interactions with coaches or fully structured programs with an therapist or coach guiding treatment. There is a lack of evidence, however, about which features are most helpful and which approach is best suited for an individual or given population. The evidence on self‐guided alone versus provider‐supported internet based treatments does indicate that human support significant improves engagement. Initial study findings and high drop out rates also suggests that a major challenge with mobile apps is user attrition and decreased engagement over time. This is where human connection and social support features may play a critical role in maintaining interest and engagement. This pilot study aims to contribute to the understanding of the use of mobile mental health apps targeting a college‐age population. By selecting a mainly social support app, it also aims to explore to what degree enhanced social support plays a role in improved outcomes. Research Design: This is a pilot study evaluating the acceptability and outcomes of a mobile social support app, 7 cups which is commercially available and widely utilized by the target population, to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety for college students seeking mental health services. Methods Recruitment and Screening: When students make an initial consultation appointment online for counseling and mental health services (CAMHS), they will be able to click a link about the study which directs them to the study enrollment website. Interested participants will complete a survey to determine eligibility including information about basic demographics and mobile device ownership. Those meeting basic eligibility requirements will also complete screening using the Patient Health Questionnaire ‐ 9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7‐item scale to determine final eligibility. If deemed to be eligible, participants will sign an electronic consent form. Approximately 500 students present to CAMHS seeking services each month, thus we estimate we will be able to enroll approximately 250 students in the study with rolling enrollment over 1‐2 months. We anticipate obtaining usable data from approximately 175 participants assuming approximately 30% drop out rate. This sample size would allow us to obtain 0.80 power to detect significant improvement (Cohen d = 0.4) assuming 30% drop out and significance 0.05. Baseline Assessment and Group Assignment: Once enrolled, participants will be asked additional questions to provide baseline assessment such as brief additional demographic information which will include participants' class year, race/ethnicity, use of other mental health apps, and current engagement in mental health treatment. We will ask participants for an email address and phone number for study staff to be able to contact them during the study. In addition, participants will be asked about current use of substances or alcohol as this is known to affect treatment outcomes. This will be collected using the AUDIT‐C, a 3‐item alcohol screen, which is a modified version of the 10‐question AUDIT instrument. Participants will also be asked to complete a brief set of questions about perceived social support to obtain a baseline assessment using the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Participants will then be randomly assigned to one of two apps: an app offering direct online social support (7cups) or an app that provides information about mental health resources on campus (Bliss). Following this, participants are guided through the process of downloading their assigned app on their smartphone, given instructions on how to reach HUHS urgent care if their symptoms worsen and how to contact the study staff with questions.

KY: Shoulder Impingement Syndrome; Syndrome
AB: Background: Musculoskeletal problems are one of the most common reasons for seeking medical advice, with estimates of up to 20% of adults annually consulting their general practitioner. The prevalence of shoulder problems in the population is approximately 2.5%(Jordon et al 2010). In 2012/13, there were over 7.1 million outpatient appointments for trauma and orthopaedics in England (accounting for 9.3% of all outpatient attendances) and over 4 million of these visits were followup after the initial consultation (Hospital Episode Statistics). The average cost for each outpatient follow up is £76. At a time when the NHS is under considerable financial burden we are constantly looking at ways and means of reducing the number of outpatient appointments and the length of time for which a patient required followup. By improving rehabilitation protocols patients may complete their recovery more rapidly which may reduce clinician patient face‐to‐face interactions. This may free up this valuable resource which can be directed towards more complex clinical requirements. Patient Engagement: One of the major factors that influence patient outcomes is their engagement with the rehabilitation program. Rehabilitation professionals have long suspected that a patient's motivation plays an important role in determining the outcome of therapy, despite the lack of a clear definition of the phenomenon (Maclean et al. 2002). It is estimated that up to 65% of patients are non/partially adherent to their home exercise program (Meichenbaum 1987). Classically, patients have completed home exercise diaries. However, studies have suggested that these are often completed retrospectively. This may encourage patients to exaggerate the amount of activity performed. Hoelscher at al (1984), timed patients at home performing a relaxation exercise program and compared this to patient reported duration. They found that the latter tended to suggest a higher level of adherence. The Exergames programmes actively track patient interaction with the software. Each activity records the length of interaction, progress through rehabilitation allowing the clinician to have a clearer indication of patient engagement in rehabilitation. Patient activation describes the knowledge, skills and confidence a person has in managing their own health and health care. Intervening to increase activation can improve a patient's engagement and health outcomes. This is an important factor in helping patients manage their health (Kings Fund 2015). As a part of this study we will quantify patient engagement. Through this we can develop and validate a new tool to comprehensively measure patient outcomes using four domains. These will be Patient reported pain and function (P), shoulder range of movement i.e. Kinematics (K), patient activation or engagement (E) and patient experience (X). Gamification: Traditional evaluation of the patient's range of motion usually occurs in a clinic, often using subjective and informal methods of angle measurement. This has the potential to create discrepancies in findings between clinicians. To reduce the use of healthcare resources, make the clinical assessment more convenient for the patient, to improve the quality of the information collected and the assessment conducted, electronic measurement has the potential to perform repeatable validated objective results. If combined with appropriate principles of gamification, these measurements can become a part of the rehabilitation process with potentially faster clinical improvement and comprehensive analysis of patient generated outcomes. In light of this, there has been a wave of support for the implementation of gaming elements in healthcare technologies. 'Gamification' involves the incorporation of game mechanics in a non‐game setting and a tailored user interface for better learning which encourages engagement (King 2013). Reward systems, competition and immediate feedback improve user experience and have been implemented in healthcare related fields where patients have become a niche target group (Lin 2013). This may in turn increase patient activation allowing them to manage their own health. MIRA: MIRA Rehab is a company who has developed software designed for the rehabilitation of medical conditions. Combined with a Microsoft Kinect sensor it accurately traces the range of motion in the shoulder. MIRA uses games which are built based upon the best clinical practice and expertise from specialist clinicians. The MIRA programme enables patients to progress through different levels within the games whilst engaging in their rehabilitation programme. Research Design and Methodology: Methodology: 90 patients will be recruited to a 3 month rehabilitation programme following a standard subacromial decompression +/biceps tenotomy for impingement syndrome. Patients will be randomised into two groups: 1. Standard postoperative physiotherapy regime without the use of accessory software (Treatment as usual Group). 2. Postoperative regime of physiotherapy plus Exergames utilizing principles of gamification. Power calculation: A sample size calculation was performed using Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) sample data collected on patients previously undergoing arthroscopic subacromial decompression. [Alpha error set at 0.05, and beta error at 0.8, mean difference of 5 points12 in the OSS, standard deviation 6.96] Based upon this, a sample size of 32 patients in each group would be required. A second sample size calculation was performed based on the disabilities of arm shoulder and hand (DASH) outcome measure. [Alpha error set at 0.05, and beta error at 0.8, mean difference of 15 points in the DASH13, standard deviation 23] Based upon this, a sample size of 37 patients in each group would be required. Therefore, a target of 45 patients per group was chosen to allow for some participants withdrawing from the study (20%). Treatment as usual Group: Patients will attend physiotherapy on a weekly basis for assessment. They will be assessed for progression and be provided with a home exercise program. Range of motion in their shoulder will be collected on a weekly basis using the MIRA technology. Patients will be required to complete an exercise diary documenting the exercises performed as well as duration and frequency. Treatment as usual plus Exergames Group: Prior to commencing the study the physiotherapists will set up and initially demonstrate the Exergames to the intervention participants in the home setting. This will ensure the safety of the patients and address any technological issues that may arise. Patients will attend physiotherapy on a weekly basis as well as partaking in a set of tailored Exergames to play in the home system. The MIRA software will record the patient engagement with the system including number of sessions and duration of play. Patients will also be asked to complete an exercise diary. VISIT SUMMARY Baseline (Clinic Consultation): Patient's eligibility to participate in the study will be assessed; inclusion/ exclusion criteria must be met. The Patient Information Sheet will be given to the patient when they are listed for surgery. Prior to their surgery date, the patient will be contacted by a member of the research team, to see if they would like to participate in the study. Patient will be asked to give their consent to the study on the day of surgery. Past medical history will be reviewed and patient demographics will be documented. Relevant questions and scoring will be taken for baseline reference. + 24 hours (following baseline assessments) The patient reported outcome measures questionnaires will be repeated by all patients. Day 1 Patient attends hospital for surgical treatment. Confirmation of study consent must be confirmed. A study diary will be dispensed to patient. Study coordinator will give full explanation regarding completion of the diary. Day 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,77. Patient must attend physiotherapy clinic at day 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,77. A scheduled visit window to allow flexibility is +/‐ 2 days. Patient is to continue with their post‐operative physiotherapy regime depending on the treatment group they have been randomised. Range of Movement will be assessed and documented by the research physiotherapist. Each patient diary will be reviewed and assessed. Day 84/85 Patient diary will be reviewed and returned. On completion of the 12 week programme all patients (N=90) will complete all outcome questionnaires, Patients randomised to Exergames arm will complete a Systems Usability score for the MIRA software. Range of movement will be recorded by MIRA and documented by the research physio‐therapist. Day 365 One year post surgery all patients (N=90) will complete the scoring questionnaires.

AB: The health benefits of regular physical activity (PA) are well recognized. An active lifestyle benefits health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) through its effect on physical and mental health. Adults and children who regularly participate in PA reported better health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to those who do not. HRQoL is a multidimensional construct that captures the impact of illness on the person's ability to live a fulfilling life. Physical, social and psychological functioning are the most important domains of HRQoL in adults and children. Although many individuals realize the beneficial effects of PA, some lack motivation to sustain the recommended workout levels whilst others lack the means. Physical activity to promote HRQOL In particular, parents living on a low income face a number of practical barriers such as unaffordable cost, lack of childcare support and limited time after work to engage in PA. Inactive parents will have difficulty to set PA examples and standards for their children. The amount of time they spend with children in activities together is also limited. Community programmes on parent‐child partner exercises have the potential to enhance HRQoL in both parents and children by increasing their PA level and quality parent‐child interactions. However, engaging low‐income adults and children in PA programmes is challenging because of their busy schedule and limited access to PA facilities. Ubiquitous technologies such as web‐based programme and smartphone applications (apps) may overcome the barriers to PA interventions for this difficult‐to‐reach population. Exercises for these families need to be simple and practical. The introduction of basic partner stretching and strength exercises that requires the parents and their children to help each other could be a good start for inactive families to change toward an active lifestyle. In addition to improved fitness, the shared joy and support during parent‐child partner exercises may promote positive moods and better life satisfaction, i.e. HRQoL. Mobile technology to promote PA Mobile device usage is rapidly increasing and half of the worldwide mobile phone subscriptions are in the Asia Pacific region. Advanced mobile devices such as smartphones are equipped with features of personal computer operating system such as persistent network connectivity and downloadable apps. Smartphone apps that combine textual information with gaming elements such as competition, scoreboard and point are growing in popularity as health promoting tools. These gaming elements harness people's aversion of losses which motivate them to keep doing exercises to achieve activity goals. In addition, apps also enable users to monitor, record and reflect on their behaviour and lifestyle in a more convenient and less stigmatizing way than traditional health interventions. However, their effectiveness in low‐income families especially on HRQoL in children is unknown. Furthermore, most of the available apps are produced in Western populations and in English, which limit their applicability to low‐income Chinese families. The few PA promotion apps that are available in Chinese language mainly target at individual adult users without considering whether the exercise moves are appropriate for children, which make it difficult to use in family intervention. Previous work done by the research team Since 2012, our research team, in collaboration with a philanthropic foundation in Hong Kong (Kerry Group Foundation (Hong Kong) Limited (KGKF)), has provided various health empowerment interventions and comprehensive health assessment to a group of low income families in Hong Kong (166 low‐income families from Tung Chung and 205 families with similar socio‐demographic background from other districts of Hong Kong). We found that local Chinese adults from low‐income families had poorer HRQoL than the general population [14]. Their children also had poorer HRQOL and more behavioral problems [15]. Results of our preliminary analysis showed that both parents and children from low‐income families reported lower levels of PA per week than the recommended levels by World Health Organization (WHO). There was a positive correlation (r=0.25, p=0.001) between the total weekly time of physical activities (including walking, moderate‐intensity or/and vigorous‐intensity activities) in parents and children. Moreover, we delivered a pilot parent‐child exercise course in October‐November 2016 and found a significant gain of 12.5 points in the scores of Mental Health scale of Child Health Questionnaire ‐ Parent Form ‐ 50 (CHQ‐PF50) of participating children. Our research team is working towards delivering this parent‐child partner exercise programme as a smartphone app. The development of the smartphone app on simple parent‐child partner exercises, which is funded by a philanthropic foundation in Hong Kong (Kerry Group Foundation (Hong Kong) Limited (KGKF)) is currently in progress. After expert consultation and review of relevant literature, we are developing a smartphone app "FAMILY MOVE" in Chinese language with the following features: ‐ Account login with a unique, anonymous participant number for each user family which would allow us to keep record of the user's frequency and duration of use of our app ‐ A fully automated 8‐week parent‐child partner exercise programme (release of Level 1 moves in Week 1‐2; Level 2 moves in Week 3‐4; Level 3 moves in Week 5‐6; revision of all moves in Week 7‐8) for young children aged 6 to 10 years and adolescents aged 11 years or above, respectively ‐ Each level consists of one warm‐up clip (1 minute), 4 short exercise move demonstration clips with audio instructions (30 seconds per clip), and 1 long dance clip (3 minutes) integrating the four exercise moves with background music ‐ Points will be given to users after they have viewed an exercise move video clip. More points would be awarded to more difficult moves ‐ The scoreboard will display personal score as well as the scores of the top 5 users ‐ Three push notifications per week as prompts to motivate users to keep doing exercises The exercise moves that the parent and children practiced in the pilot exercise course had been filmed after modification based on opinions from PA experts and would be used as demonstration videos in the app. A pre‐post pilot study will be conducted in 2017 on 166 parent‐child pairs recruited from the group of families living in Tung Chung district in our cohort after the FAMILY MOVE app is produced. Parents of eligible families will be notified by SMS ("Short Message Service") and asked whether they agree or not to receive the FAMILY MOVE app as part of our health empowerment study. Parents who agree to participate in this pilot 8‐week intervention study will be asked to complete the same set of questionnaires on their own HRQOL, PA levels and mental health condition and their children's HRQOL, behavior and PA levels at each assessment time point (baseline, 1‐month and 6‐month post intervention). Building upon such groundwork and existing evidence, in the present study our team would like to evaluate further by launching a randomized‐controlled trial (RCT) examining the effectiveness of a simple parent‐child partner exercise programme delivered as a smartphone app "FAMILY MOVE" in enhancing the HRQoL and PA level of children from low‐income families. Aims and Hypotheses to be Tested: Study Objectives 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of the smartphone app "FAMILY MOVE" in improving the HRQoL of children; 2. To evaluate the effectiveness of the smartphone app "FAMILY MOVE" in improving the PA levels of children; 3. To explore the associations between "FAMILY MOVE" app usage and HRQoL and PA of children. Study hypotheses 1. Compared to the control group, children from the intervention group will show better HRQoL (measured by the Psychosocial Summary scores of the Child Health Questionnaire ‐ Parent Form ‐ 50 (CHQ‐PF50)) at 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after intervention. 2. Compared to the control group, children from the intervention group will show greater PA measured by the METS (Metabolic Equivalent for Task) ‐minutes/week at 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after intervention. 3. There is a positive correlation of improvement in HRQoL and PA levels of children with the time they spend on the FAMILY MOVE app.

TI: A RCT Promoting Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03414710
YR: 2018
KY: Sexually Transmitted Diseases
AB: Study Design A parallel‐group and non‐blinded RCT is conducted. Face‐to‐face interview is conducted at baseline in the collaborating STD clinics. A 5‐minute telephone survey is conducted six months afterwards by blinded interviewers. Up to five calls will be made at different timeslots during weekdays/weekends before considering a case as loss‐to‐follow up. Participants Inclusion criteria are: 1) Chinese male aged ≥18 years, 2) uncircumcised, 3) diagnosis of any one of the five types of STDs listed in the national surveillance system: Primary, secondary or latent syphilis (determined by Treponemapallidum Particle Assay and Toluidine Red Untreated Serum Test), genital warts (diagnosed by presence of clinical symptoms and supported by biopsy), genital herpes (diagnosed clinically, supported by ELISA), or gonorrhea or NGU (diagnosed by using Polymerase Chain Reaction), and 4) willingness to leave contact information (mobile and/or electronic) with the investigators and be followed up at Month 6. Men who had ever had oral or anal sex with men and those who were known to be HIV positive are excluded. Recruitment procedures To avoid selection bias, all male sexually transmitted disease patients (MSTDP) attending the five participating clinics during the study period are invited to participate in the study. A clinician ensures the eligibility of the prospective participants to join the study in a consultation room and refers them to the trained counselors who are STD clinicians. The interviewers then brief the participants about the study, assure them that refusals would not affect their right to use any services and that they can quit any time without being questioned. Written informed consent will be sought. Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Guangdong Provincial Dermatology Hospital, Guangzhou, China. The baseline survey and random allocation process After completion the baseline face‐to‐face interview, participants will be randomized 1:1 to either the intervention group or the control group. Computer‐generated random allocation codes are produced and sealed in opaque envelopes by a research staff with no involvement in recruitment or baseline survey. One envelope will be drawn and opened in front of the participant by the counselors. The counselors then inform the participant which group he is assigned to. Block randomization with block size of eight is used. The Control Group After randomization took place, the control group will receive an education booklet introducing voluntary medical male circumcision. The contents include: 1) harms of STD infection on men and their female sex partners (e.g., STD infection increases risk of HIV acquisition), 2) benefit of VMMC in reducing risk of HIV and STD infection in men, and the indirect protective effects for their female sex partners, 3) basic information of VMMC, including cost, hospitals that offer VMMC, common side effects and recovery time. If the participants are willing to take up VMMC, the counselors will facilitate them to make an appointment for check‐up and surgery. The Intervention Group In addition to the educational booklet received by the control group, the intervention group will receive the following health promotion: 1. Watch a 10‐minute video promoting VMMC: in the video, a well‐known STD clinician talks about severity of STD infection and benefits of VMMC, and gave reminders about the importance of consistent condom use even after taking up VMMC. He also expresses his support to the participants for taking up VMMC. One MSTDP who had taken up VMMC presented a testimonial in the video about his positive experience with VMMC, including mild pain and surgical complications of VMMC, improvement in sexual pleasure and sexual functioning after taking up VMMC, and support received from his peers and female sex partners with respect to VMMC. 2. Receive a brief counseling promoting VMMC: the counselors would discuss with those who consider taking up VMMC about their concerns, and encourage them to make a specific plan to take up VMMC; the counselors also remind those who show no intention to take up VMMC in the next six months about the risk of HIV/STD infection and the benefit of taking up VMMC. If the participants are willing to take up VMMC, the counselors will facilitate them to make an appointment for check‐up and surgery. Measures Outcomes and confounders Potential confounders include socio‐demographics, utilization of HIV/STD prevention services, STD history, foreskin condition and condomless sex with regular female sex partners (RP: defined as their wives or stable girlfriends), female sex workers (FSW: defined as a female who exchanged sex for money) and non‐regular female sex partners (NRP: defined as a female who was neither FSW nor RP) since exhibiting STD symptoms or receiving an STD diagnosis. The primary outcome was whether the participant has taken up VMMC within the 6‐month follow‐up period. Secondary outcomes are perceptions related to VMMC based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (scores of the Positive Attitude Scale, the Negative Attitude Scale, the Subjective Norm Scale and the Perceived Behavioral Control Scale). Process evaluation Process evaluation of health promotion will also be conducted at Month 6. Participants in both groups will be asked: 1) whether the content of the health promotion is clear, 2) whether the materials (video or booklet) is attractive to them, 3) whether the health promotion has increased their understanding about the benefit of VMMC and willingness to take up VMMC. Participants in the intervention group are asked an additional question about their satisfaction of the counseling session. Post‐surgical experience At Months 6, circumcised participants will be asked whether they have any surgical complication, and whether they have sought medical consultation due to such complications. Sexually active circumcised participants will be asked whether they have reduce condom use with RP, NRP or FSW, or increase number of such female sex partners after taking up VMMC. Sample size planning In a single‐arm, non‐blinded test‐of‐concept trial, 19.9% had taken up VMMC during the 4‐month follow‐up period after exposing to a similar intervention (i.e., watching a 10‐minute video clip and receiving brief consultation and a health education booklet). In this study, assuming 20% of the participants will take up VMMC in the intervention group within the 6‐month follow period, the sample size of 71 per group would allow us to detect a between‐group difference in the uptake of VMMC of 15% or above (a=0.05, 2‐sided test with statistical power of 0.8; PASS). Taking into account an expected drop‐out rate of 40% at Month 6, a sample size of 119 per group was required. The total sample size would be 238. Statistical analysis Baseline between‐group differences will be compared by using Chi‐square test. Intention‐to‐treat analysis will be used for outcome analyses. Relative risk (RR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), and number needed to treat (NNT) statistics will be used to test between‐group difference in primary outcome. Wilcoxon signed‐ranked test will be used to test the between‐group difference in secondary outcomes. Within‐group difference will be tested by using McNemar test. SPSS version 16.0 will be used, and p values <0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.

TI: The Effectiveness of Gamification Diabetes Education Program for Poorly Controlled Type 2 Diabetic Patients
SO: Https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct03273140
YR: 2017
AB: The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is increasing internationally, corresponding with the rising aging population. Nearly half of the population was unaware that they have diabetes and the number is portended to reach 439 million worldwide by the year 2030. This global phenomenon draws the attention on the enormous health care expenditure spent on managing DM alone. The financial burden of diagnosed diabetes was 2.3 times higher than the absence of it, reflecting as one of the barriers in engaging diabetes patients and promoting self‐efficacy. Type 2 diabetes patients, also known as non‐insulin dependent diabetes, are the high‐risk population to experience a diabetes‐related complication, such as, end‐stage renal failure (ESRF), stroke, cardiovascular disease and amputation of the limbs, all of which can lead to poor quality of life (QoL), depression and even death. Local statistics demonstrated an increase of 25.6% (2013 to 2015) of diabetic patients in an outpatient endocrinology clinic and ten percent hospital readmission rate of patients due to poor compliance and diabetes‐related health issues. A retrospective study done locally in the primary health care polyclinics had shown an incline percentage of attendances with DM, from 8.8% to 9.8% over the past five years (2011 to 2015), reflecting an increase of 8155 diabetic patients. Their average age group is 40 years old. According to American Diabetes Association (ADA, 2014), glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) value has been recognized as the standard measurement in diagnosing and treating DM and, the value of ≤7% was correlated with a reduction in diabetes complications. Each 1% of the reduction in HbA1c values over ten years is equivalent to 21% of the reduced risk of diabetes‐related outcomes and death, including 14% of the reduced risk for myocardial infarcts and 37% for microvascular complication (p<0.0001). Effective diabetes management or self‐efficacy appears strongly related to healthy lifestyle modification and behavioral change, such as medication adherence, compliance to treatment‐regime and exercising. In comparison, poor access to quality care, stress, and obesity has a detrimental effect on HbA1c values and increased the risk for diabetes‐related complication as mentioned. Poor clinical outcomes consists of HbA1c >7.0%, systolic blood pressure > 130mmHg, body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 25, abnormal low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) and high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) measurement. Poor diabetes outcomes are related to depressive symptoms, anxiety, low self‐efficacy, poor self‐esteem, eating disorders and diabetes‐related stress, including osteoporosis among the Chinese diabetes patients. Hence, diabetes patient education is an important cornerstone in self‐management, self‐efficacy, and long‐term behavior change. Patient education is defined as a process of providing skills and knowledge, including giving advice and alternatives for lifestyle modification in diabetes management and glycemic control. Health education aimed at preventing diabetes‐related complications and can lead to improved health literacy that supports greater empowerment in health decision‐making and outcomes. There is no consistency of teaching contents in diabetes educational program. It could be due to that the program was led by a different healthcare professional, such as pharmacist, dietician or nutritionist, diabetes nurse educator and or psychologist. To some extent, the benefits of these diabetes education programs had shown improvement in self‐management and glycemic control, including a reduction in depression, and enhancing self‐efficacy behaviors and better quality of life. However, all these require an ongoing positive reinforcement in order to achieve a successful long‐term intervention and good glycemic control. An effective diabetic patient education would mean success in diabetic self‐management, which is associated with better metabolic control, lower costs of therapy through complication prevention, lower mortality rate, reduced readmission rates, improve QoL and, better self‐efficacy and health behaviors. The current diabetic patient education in many hospitals locally, be it private or government sectors still use the traditional teaching method; the face‐to‐face approach. Primarily and tertiary health care sectors, like polyclinics and outpatient endocrinology clinics, are also using face‐to‐face approach. There are various health care professionals, such as doctors, nurses, diabetic nurse educator (DNE), dieticians and podiatrists who conduct diabetic education. Face‐to‐face interactions require intensive manpower, as health care professionals need to engage the patients within a stipulated time period. During these sessions, the DNEs needs to achieve the educational goals, such as impacting knowledge, assessing attitudes and encouraging self‐efficacy towards managing their own disease. Each DNE takes an average of 45 minutes in counseling each patient. At times, such educational goals can only be achieved over several scheduled visits, in view of the increasing patient numbers and acuity, and it may not be practical or feasible to achieve the long‐term goal with one‐time consultation. On the other hand, group based education had demonstrated better health outcomes in HbA1c values, diabetes knowledge, feeling of empowerment and reduced fatigue level although North and Palmer (2015) reported no significant difference (p<0.001) in HbA1c values between individual and group‐based diabetes education. Nevertheless, the face‐to‐face advice remains an important influence on behavioral outcomes through motivation and counseling, and likely to constitute knowledge exchange through diabetes education. This social interaction enhances the quality of life (QoL) and promotes critical reflection upon why and how certain activities occur. A study conducted in Germany reported that elevated HbA1C value of ≥7% was associated with risk of cognitive‐decline and dementia among the diabetes patients. Achieving good HbA1c level can delay the onset of microvascular complication (Venkataraman et al., 2013). Diabetes patient education can improve HbA1C values, be it at the most statistically significant at the third month (p=0.02). The other two studies had also shown a clinical improvement in HbA1C values at the six‐month, with a p=0.004 (Jaipakdee et al., 2015) and p<0.05. In comparison, two studies had demonstrated no clinical improvement at the 6‐month, with a p= 0.94 and p=0.334 respectively. Similarly, Krebs et al., (2013) had shown insignificant HbA1C values at 9‐month (p=0.22) and whereas, Collins‐McNeil, Edwards, Batch, Benbow, McDougald, and Sharpe (2012) reported significant result (p=0.1) after a 12‐weeks diabetes educational program. There is a positive association (p<0.001) between HbA1C values and motivational factors after adjustment for potential confounders, such as gender, age, body mass index and diabetes knowledge (Nouwen et al., 2011). This means that negative proposition, such as depression, portends poorer control of diabetes mellitus; higher HbA1C values. The clinical management and advice via the traditional consultation approach are insufficient to achieve good diabetes management and glycemic control (Krebs et al., 2013). There is a gap between applications of knowledge to actualize self‐efficacy behaviors among the type 2 diabetic patients. Drawing the voices of diabetes patients' perspective on the barriers to better diabetes management and glycemic control could avoid miscommunication. Most studies had explored the barriers and facilitators in diabetes self‐management and education. The facilitators that emerged were having good relationship with health care professionals, simple and practical instructions and favorable community environment, although it was suggested to improve the collaboration between primary and secondary care (Raajimakers et al., 2013). The five barriers that emerged were physical barriers (knowledge deficit), psychological barriers (over dependence on western medication despite disliking them; lack of motivation and self‐competency to follow guidelines), social barriers (family role expectations, cuisine culture, lack of trustworthy information sources, confusing health information, lack of awareness of lifestyle programs; prevention initiatives and social support, and communication deficit between patient‐practitioner), and care system barriers (restriction of reimbursement regulations). Shen et al. (2013) added that the latter barrier had also resulted in a reduction of filial responsibility in China due to the cultural inferences of the one‐child policy. These findings supported that self‐efficacy and diabetes knowledge is crucial in diabetes management and control. The use of smartphones and mobile apps has grown exponentially over the years, with technologies touching the remote corners of the globe. Seidel et al. (2014) echoed that 83% of the high‐risk group for type II diabetes (mean age of 52.7 years old) prefers technology‐based or telephone‐supported program than class‐based and that the Asians are more likely to choose technology‐based program than the Whites. Apparently, half of the causal gamers (participants) fall within the age range of 35 to 64 years old. Mobile health technologies include telemonitoring, web‐based program and mobile platform applications, all of which, had demonstrated a positive impact on diabetes‐related outcomes and clinician‐related outcomes, by addressing issues related to missing medications and finishing prescribed medication. To elaborate, computer‐based technology and web‐based program promoted knowledge retention and enhanced diabetes knowledge; behavior and HbA1c level that includes reduced hypoglycemia episodes. Hence, it could be a potential alternative to group lectures for diabetes self‐management education. On the other hand, apps are downloadable programs designed to operate on smartphone operating system, and the use of smartphones apps had sustainable benefits in relation to behavioral change and successfully engage the type 2 diabetics, thereby gaining motivation to interpret and use the contents better accordingly to one's needs. The key point in using mobile apps is to improve user experience so as to enhance engagement. A study conducted in South Caroline reported a 0.5% reduction means of the HbA1c level after mobile health intervention over a six‐months follow‐up. However, this intervention should not only restrict to sms alone as it offers a new and promising platform for connecting patient to meaningful resources, by serving as a practical bridge between health care and community‐based resources that promote diabetic self‐efficacy, behavioral modification, and all those related to improving diabetes‐related health outcomes. Next, it also has the potential to tailor health communication and transform health service delivery on a global perspective concerns. Gaming is defined as a tool to present complex and real‐world problems, linking theory to real‐life situations through the application of principles, theory, and concepts. Gamification involves games that are designed with practical training objective or simulation that includes the presentation of factual knowledge and psychomotor skills. The design of avatars in prototype gamification linked gaming to "real‐life" situations or clinical settings, and thus, allowing for a more realistic interface to the players. Their advantages are in enhancing the learners' skills through mastery performance, and comprehension of diabetes‐related knowledge through observational learning at own pace. Games may be served as an assessment tool and are good resources for people with lower literacy level as it permits repetitive usage and learning at own pace. The more the participants engaged with games, the higher the sense of being "in control", "important" and "empowered". In contrast, the longer the duration of attention retention through games, the greater the exposure and likelihood of a behavior change. The effectiveness of gaming was reflected by an improvement seen in self‐efficacy, symptom management and knowledge gained through active participation. Games can also address few unmet needs, such as, retaining of contents and information through repetitive playing and learning; compare and contrast information resource; allowing clinicians to keep tracks on the games scores; a sense of control over own body and challenging reality of everyday life. Another important key aspect to take note when developing informatics technology, is the health status of an individual, in view that the diabetes people with disabilities are less likely to use the internet than others due to the lack of access, expertise and physical conditions that made the Internet use difficult. There was a study limitation in reporting the effectiveness and feasibility of games for type 2 diabetes patients. Eagleson et al. (2017) supported that the development and implementation of mobile health and web‐based interventions are not well documented and fragment in the current literature. The concerns being raised were that either the mobile application was developed in an American context with different guideline recommendations that may influence the effectiveness and utility in different context, or that, the gaming platforms were either outdated or short shelf life, which can result in confusion due to uncertainty about reliability, security, regulation and integration concerns. In addition, the games are also not updated with new scenarios regularly on a long‐term basis. The other flip sides of mobile gaming application include the inability to address the psychological (human factors), motivation, provider‐patient miscommunication (health care system) and social‐economic aspects, which can affect self‐management or manageability, and that, it can be costly and time‐consuming in the development process. It was recommended to consider these prior developing a gaming application, which were (i) using a highly personalized and user‐centered system for compliance and educational needs, (ii) input an interactive tool, such as dragging food into a plate, (iii) input a nursing workstation for accessibility of information and problem‐solving solutions, and lastly, (iv) input sharing forum and interactive quizzes. Mobile apps could be an innovative way of learning or packaging in diabetes education. Although a pilot study conducted in California reported that their bilingual diabetic program demonstrated that improved knowledge might not be required to improve positive behaviors, but it aids in preventing errors while using diabetes technology. Individual using technology has a better understanding and knowledge on DM. The impact of increased knowledge can firstly, influence the individual's understanding and perception of how diabetes is being viewed, based on one's experience and the information retrieved from social media, family and friends, especially those with diabetes. This, in turn, can either act as a motivator or barrier to their cognitive domain. The challenge ahead is to implement steps to trigger the meaningfulness out from that individual, so as to engage him/her in lifestyle modification and taking ownership of own health, such as healthy eating, foot care, and medication adherence. Secondly, knowledge influence individual's adherence to medication, self‐care and treatment plan, which can enhance HbA1C level, and promote self‐efficacy and health behaviors, such as self‐monitoring of blood glucose level. Diabetes patients feel empowered once they have sufficient knowledge to make rational decisions, sufficient control, and resources to implement their decisions, and sufficient experience to evaluate the effectiveness of their decision. Thus, enhance QoL and reduces mental health concerns, such as anxiety and depression. Improving the quality of life could result in better motivation and social activity. There is a dearth of knowledge on in these areas: firstly, there is a study limitation in integrating socio‐cognitive framework and self‐efficacy into designing a gamification diabetic educational program, which includes evaluating its feasibility as an assessment tool in diabetes education. Secondly, there is a lack of uniformity and consistency in teaching contents, delivery of health policy and culturally congruent services in a multi‐facet country. Thirdly, there is a study limitation in using randomized control trial design to evaluate the effectiveness of the empirical gamification diabetes educational program on HbA1c values, self‐efficacy, sense of coherence and quality of life. This study will firstly, add to the growing research on using gamification application as an education tool in the diabetic population, and secondly, serves to transform workforce and redesign patient education process for type II diabetes patients that include achieving optimum productivity and delivering of value‐added services that meet the needs of the future healthcare system.

TI: A trial to increase participation in the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program by eligible Indigenous clients of participating primary health care centres that receive either an intensive model of support or a low intensity model of support in offering screening
SO: Http://www.who.int/trialsearch/trial2.aspx? Trialid=actrn12618001555246
YR: 2018
AB: INTERVENTION: Intervention Arm A (low intensity support) ‐ Primary health care centres in this arm are offered a low intensity model of support to prepare them to offer the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program bowel screening kit to their eligible clients (aged 50‐74). This support includes access to an online training module for health centre staff about bowel cancer and bowel cancer screening and other resources to assist them to deliver the program to their clients. When eligible clients attend the health centre they will be invited to screen and receive a bowel screening kit as part of the Alternative Pathway. The on‐line training module includes the following topics: About bowel cancer and bowel cancer screening; Risk factors for bowel cancer; Bowel cancer treatment; Incidence, survival and screening participation rates; About the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program; About the Alternative Pathway; Talking about bowel screening with your Indigenous clients (clinical and social aspects); Assessing suitability for screening; Understanding test results; General Practitioner assessment; Colonoscopy; Risks and benefits of screening. The online training module will take health professionals about one hour to complete. It was designed specifically for the pilot to relate directly to the context of primary health care centres and health professionals providing services to Indigenous clients in the eligible age group. It includes the use of animations, a music video, and with voiceovers by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander actors (two male, one female). Short quizzes (three to six questions each) test participant knowledge and learning throughout the module. Designed primarily for Indigenous Health Workers, the resources can be used by other health professionals. Other resources developed specifically for this project and provided as part of the low intensity support model include: ‐ A manual for implementation: 'The Alternative Pathway in your Health Centre' provides primary health care centre managers and staff with the information to prepare for and deliver the Alternative Pathway, such as how the Alternative pathway differs from the usual pathway for accessing the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program; what needs to be done before health centres will be able to offer the Alternative Pathway to their eligible Indigenous clients; requirements for managing test kits (both before and after samples are taken); obtaining client consent and providing client information through the secure online Participant Details (Health Centre Initiated) form; receiving client results electronically or on paper from the Program’s pathology provider; Program follow‐up procedures for individuals who receive a kit but do not complete it, or who receive a positive result and do not proceed with a General Practitioner assessment and/or colonoscopy if referred; requirements for General Practitioner assessments; access to colonoscopy and supporting clients who are referred for colonoscopy.

KY: Heart Defects, Congenital; Heart Diseases; Ischemia; Reperfusion Injury
AB: Ischemic Preconditioning (IPC) refers to the phenomenon where a brief ischemia‐reperfusion event to a tissue/organ can result in subsequent protection from a more severe ischemia‐reperfusion event to that tissue/organ. There are many descriptions of IPC in animal models. Protection occurs in two phases: early after the IPC (<4hr), and later after the IPC (24‐72hr). The protection is marked, with reduction in infarction sizes in brain and heart on the order of 50% or more. The later phase provides protection against infarction (lethal reperfusion injury) and stunning (post‐ischemic myocardial dysfunction), while the early phase provides protection against infarction only. The mechanisms of IPC have been divided into 4 phases: preconditioning insult, stress sensors, signal transduction, and effectors of protection. Remote Ischemic PreConditioning (RIPC) refers to the finding that a brief ischemia‐reperfusion event to a tissue/organ results in subsequent protection from a more severe ischemia‐reperfusion event to a different tissue/organ. This is advantageous because the tissue subjected to the preconditioning stimulus can be more accessible and less vulnerable than the target organ to be protected, such as the brain or heart. Animal studies have demonstrated the efficacy of RIPC. The mechanisms and timing (early and late phases) appear to be the same as for IPC. There are several adult human studies of IPC. Studies of IPC in adults having coronary bypass surgery have found improvements in acute markers of myocardial injury and hemodynamic function. A meta‐analysis of 22 trials of IPC during cardiac surgery in adults found a significant improvement in postoperative arrhythmias, inotrope requirements, and intensive care unit stay in the IPC group. There are adult studies showing that RIPC prevents ischemia‐reperfusion injury. Currently, 3 large adult randomized control trial (RCT) are underway investigating the effects of RIPC after cardiac surgery and stroke. There are six studies of RIPC in children . In one study 37 children having cardiac surgery were randomized to RIPC induced by lower limb ischemia with a blood pressure cuff. The levels of troponin I and inotrope requirements were significantly greater in the control group vs. the RIPC group. In another study infants having repair of ventricular septal defect were randomized to receive RIPC 24 hr and 1 hr before CPB. The postoperative release of cytokines and heart enzymes were attenuated, there was better lung and heart function, and no adverse effects. A study in children with ventricular septal defect found that early RIPC and post‐conditioning were associated with lower levels of troponin I, creatinine kinase and inotrope score post‐operative. A recent RCT of children undergoing cardiac surgery found that late RIPC was associated with lower N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide but no difference in inflammatory markers or cardiac dysfunction. Similarly, a more recent small RCT of RIPC did not find any difference in troponin I levels or other short term outcomes. The largest RIPC pediatric RCT performed to date involved 113patients with the expectation that RIPC would reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury. This study found only a trend towards lower incidence of acute kidney injury in the RIPC group. The interpretation of most of these studies is difficult due to the small samples, and multiple analyses and without prestated primary or secondary outcomes. Recent reviews suggest studies be done with a larger sample size. Potential Concerns in Children: In immature rodents, preconditioning with lipopolysaccharide, or oxygen‐glucose deprivation, results in worse brain injury on ischemia‐reperfusion. This raises the possibility of harm from IPC in neonates. This is very unlikely for the following reasons. First, this data applies to neonates at <32 weeks post‐conception age. Second, lipopolysaccharide protected the brain when given 4 hr and 24hr before the ischemic event. Third, hypoxic preconditioning is protective to the immature brain. Safety concerns: Based on the above discussion of potential concerns, and the studies reviewed, we anticipate no adverse effects from RIPC. Discomfort during RIPC is mild and will be treated with sedation if necessary. The dose of midazolam given for this purpose has been shown to be safe. Potential Interference with Preconditioning: Animal studies have found that beta‐blockers, sulfonylurea, caffeine, aminophylline, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and naloxone interfere with IPC. Patients on any of these drugs will be excluded. There are studies showing that inhalational anesthetics are pharmacologic preconditioning agents. The mechanism of action involves some of the same pathways as IPC. However, the response to IPC and anesthetic preconditioning involve a substantial subset of genes unique to each preconditioning stimulus. Studies of anesthetic preconditioning have found conflicting results suggesting that anesthetic preconditioning, if it occurs, is likely to be enhanced by IPC. Furthermore, in clinical studies with promising results discussed above, anesthetics were used during the surgical procedure. Objectives: a) To demonstrate the feasibility of patient recruitment to a RIPC RCT at our center; and b) determine the effect of RIPC on the early postoperative course of infants after cardiac surgery. We aim to recruit 4 patients/month for a total of 50 patients in 1 year; this recruitment rate would make a larger trial feasible. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that a) the target patient recruitment will be feasible, and b) RIPC will result in a 50% reduction in the peak lactate level on day 1 postoperatively. Study design: We propose a pilot double blind randomized controlled trial. Randomization will be done by a computer based program to ensure allocation concealment. A total of 50 patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive an RIPC stimulus or control (sham‐RIPC). Concomitant medications/interventions: The cardioplegia solution used, and the dose of steroids given in the operating room will be standardized in order to minimize the possibility of confounders. We will use Sevoflurane as an inhalation agent, and will record the dose and duration in both study arms. Baseline variables: To be sure the groups are comparable and that known risk factors are equally distributed among both groups, we will record the following: demographic variables (sex, gestational age, birth weight, weight at surgery, age at surgery, mother's years of schooling, father's socioeconomic status); preoperative variables (cardiac diagnosis, cyanosis preoperatively (oxygen saturation <85%), single/biventricular heart physiology, days on mechanical ventilation, inotrope score, lowest Pa02, highest lactate, and highest base deficit); and intraoperative variables (lactate level and troponin I level before CPB, duration of inhalational anesthetic, CPB time, aortic cross clamp time, DHCA use, DHCA duration, and re‐CPB in the operating room). Study procedures: When the patient is admitted at the Stollery Children's Hospital and the necessity of heart surgery with CPB is established, patients will be screened for eligibility. Written informed consent will be asked. After consent, patient demographics and baseline variables will be recorded. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention group or the control group. Randomization will be done by a computer based program at the Epidemiology Coordinating and Research Centre (EPICORE) to facilitate the procedure and to ensure allocation concealment. As a patient qualifies for the trial, a study number and a randomization number will be assigned. Follow up visit: A follow up visit will be scheduled at age 2 years. During the follow‐up visit a certified pediatric psychologist and, who will be unaware if the patients was randomized to the intervention or the control group, will assess the neurodevelopmental outcome of the subject at the tertiary site of origin. Masking: This is a double blind study. The research nurse will cover the lower body of the subject with a drape, so that whether the cuff is being inflated around or underneath the leg is not known by others. The only people that will know the patient allocation will be at EPICOR and the research nurse performing the intervention. Patient Withdrawal: A patient may be withdrawn from the study if an intolerable adverse event thought to be related to the RIPC occurs, if the patient's parent(s) wish their child to be withdrawn, or if the clinicians caring for the patient or the site investigator believe it is in the best interests of the patient to withdraw. Sample size justification: The primary outcome used to determine sample size for a future larger RCT is the Bayley III cognitive composite score 2 years post‐operatively. The minimal clinically important difference for the Bayley III cognitive score is half a SD. This is a medium effect size usually considered to indicate different classes of patient outcome. The Boston Circulatory Arrest trial was designed to detect a difference of half a standard deviation in intelligence quotient, and considered the detected 6.5 point deficit in Psychomotor Development Index of the Bayley (43% of a SD) clinically significant. Our data from the CPTP shows a mean Bayley III cognitive score of 91 with SD 16. To detect an 8 (half a SD) point increase in the mean cognitive score at 2 years with an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, we need 63 patients per group. In the CPTP cohort studies, loss to follow up has been <2% at 2 years, and exclusion criteria were met by about 5% of eligible neonates in 2009. Loss to follow up is unlikely in these patients because they need frequent follow up visits with the pediatric cardiologist and pediatricians. To account for loss to follow up and early withdrawal from the study we plan to enroll a total of 140 patients (70 patients in each group) in the future study. The Stollery Children's Hospital is the referral center for pediatric cardiac surgery in Western Canada, all the neonates having heart surgery are transferred to the Stollery preoperatively. The enrollment of 50 patients in 1 year in the pilot study would determine that recruitment of 140 patients in 3 years is feasible. Furthermore, based on data from our center (mean peak lactate level 4.6, SD 2.4) a sample size of 50 patients will allow us to detect a 50% reduction in peak lactate level on day 1 post‐operative with an alpha (two sided) of 0.05 and 0.9 power. Statistical Analysis: Demographic and baseline characteristics will be analyzed by descriptive methods. We will analyze all outcome variables on intention to treat basis. The primary efficacy analysis will compare the mean peak lactate level at day 1 post‐operatively between the RIPC group and the control group using student‐t test. The purpose of the pilot study is to assess the safety and feasibility of conducting the study and as such the data (except the peak lactate level at day 1) will be analyzed with descriptive methods and not used for statistical inferential purposes. Analysis will be done only for the purposes of sample size calculation for the future larger RCT and to establish trends. All statistical tests will be two‐sided with 0.05 level of significance. Data will be analyzed with Stata (version 10.0, Statacorp, Texas). Data collection: All variables will be recorded on paper case report forms by the research nurse. Upon completion, the data will be transferred to an anonymized computer database. In summary: we plan to study a promising, easy, low cost and simple method (RIPC) with great therapeutic potential to prevent ischemia‐reperfusion injury in infants with congenital heart disease.

AB: INTERVENTION: This study is a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (simple randomization with a computer generated sequence). The intervention is access to GeriMedRisk®, a pioneering, interdisciplinary, technology‐based geriatric pharmacology consultation service that aims to optimize a patient’s medications to improve cognition, mobility, function, and mental health. Clinicians with a patient‐generated geriatric pharmacotherapy question will be able to contact GeriMedRisk® and access GeriMedRisk®’s nurses, pharmacists, and physicians specializing in geriatric medicine, clinical pharmacology and geriatric psychiatry by telephone or telemedicine during business hours. There are two methods for referral: 1. Telephone: This traditional mode of person‐to‐person consultation can be real‐time, or used as a paging service whereby the referring clinician leaves a call‐back number and GeriMedRisk® calls back at a later time. 2. Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN) e‐consult: The referring clinician emails an eConsult request through the secure OTNhub (www.OTNhub.ca) to GeriMedRisk® with the necessary clinical information and within days, GeriMedRisk® team responds through eConsult with a request for additional information or recommendations. Additional support through the phone, OTN videoconference or in‐person may be arranged if necessary. The GeriMedRisk® staff will collaborate with the referring clinician to perform a geriatric pharmacology consultation, based on a comprehensive geriatric assessment, which aims to optimize the patient’s medications, cognition, comorbidities, mobility, function and mental health.

AB: The demand for new healthcare services is growing rapidly. Improving accessibility of the African population to diabetes care seems to be a big challenge in most countries where the number of care centers and medical staff is reduced. Information and communication technologies (ICT) have great potential to address some of these challenges faced by several countries in providing accessible, cost‐effective, and high‐quality health care services. This paper presents the Mobil Diab system which is a telemedical approach proposed for the management of long‐term diseases. The system applies modern mobile and web technologies which overcome geographical barriers, and increase access to health care services. The idea of the system is to involve patients in the therapy process and motivate them for an active participation. For validation of the system in African context, a trial was conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 40 Subjects with diabetes divided randomly into control and intervention groups were included in the test. Results show that Mobil Diab is suitable for African countries and presents a number of benefits for the population and public health care system. It improves clinical management and delivery of diabetes care services by enhancing access, quality, motivation, reassurance, efficiency, and cost‐effectiveness.

AB: BACKGROUND: GPs are crucial in adequately diagnosing and initiating appropriate management for patients with psychological problems, but face many challenges and require support. AIM: To determine the effects of the e‐tool PsyScan. DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomised controlled trial with a 1‐year follow‐up, comparing care using PsyScan with usual care for psychological problems, was undertaken in 10 multidisciplinary primary healthcare centres in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. METHOD: Between consultations with their GP, participants in the intervention group could complete PsyScan. The e‐tool consists of a distress screener and Four‐Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire to differentiate between stress, depression, anxiety, and somatisation symptoms, and to explore symptom severity. PsyScan generated diagnostic and therapeutic advice for GPs and participants that was automatically transferred to each patient's electronic medical record. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants that achieved a successful treatment result; namely, a decrease of ≥50% on the Symptom Checklist‐90‐Revised, after 1 year. RESULTS: There were 176 participants in the intervention group and 160 in the control group. After multiple imputation, the participants in the intervention group had higher chances of achieving a successful treatment result compared with those in the control group (odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5 to 4.8, P = 0.002). Quality of life was higher in the intervention group at 12 months (mean difference in EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels index values was 0.076, 95% CI = 0.015 to 0.136, P = 0.01). The mean 1‐year costs per participant were similar (€13 622 in intervention group, €12 487 in control group [β = ‐0.03, P = 0.71, R2 = 0.05]). CONCLUSION: PsyScan generated clinically relevant and statistically significant effects, and could be useful in offering effective individualised care to patients.

AB: OBJECTIVES: Digital interventions can change patients' experiences of managing their health, either creating additional burden or improving their experience of healthcare. This qualitative study aimed to explore perceived burdens and benefits for patients using a digital self‐management intervention for reducing high blood pressure. A secondary aim was to further our understanding of how best to capture burdens and benefits when evaluating health interventions. DESIGN: Inductive qualitative process study nested in a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Primary Care in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 35 participants taking antihypertensive medication and with uncontrolled blood pressure at baseline participated in semistructured telephone interviews. INTERVENTION: Digital self‐management intervention to support blood pressure self‐monitoring and medication change when recommended by the healthcare professional. ANALYSIS: Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis with techniques from grounded theory. RESULTS: Seven themes were developed which reflected perceived burdens and benefits of using the intervention, including worry about health, uncertainty about self‐monitoring and reassurance. The analysis showed how beliefs about their condition and treatment appeared to influence participants' appraisal of the value of the intervention. This suggested that considering illness and treatment perceptions in Burden of Treatment theory could further our understanding of how individuals appraise the personal costs and benefits of self‐managing their health. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' appraisal of the burden or benefit of using a complex self‐management intervention seemed to be influenced by experiences within the intervention (such as perceived availability of support) and beliefs about their condition and treatment (such as perceived control and risk of side effects). Developing our ability to adequately capture these salient burdens and benefits for patients could help enhance evaluation of self‐management interventions in the future. Many participants perceived important benefits from using the intervention, highlighting the need for theory to recognise that engaging in self‐management can include positive as well as negative aspects.

AB: BACKGROUND: Disordered eating (DE) is a widespread, serious problem. Efficacious prevention programs that can be delivered at‐scale are needed. METHODS: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial of two online programs was conducted. Participants were young‐adult women from Australia and New Zealand seeking to improve their body image. Media Smart‐Targeted (MS‐T) and Student Bodies (SB) were both 9‐module interventions released weekly, whilst control participants received positive body image information. Primary [Eating Disorder Examination‐Questionnaire (EDE‐Q) Global], secondary (DE risk factors) and tertiary (DE) outcome measures were completed at baseline, post‐program, 6‐ and 12‐month follow‐up. RESULTS: Baseline was completed by 608 women (M age = 20.71 years); 33 were excluded leaving 575 randomized to: MS‐T (N = 191); SB (N = 190) or control (N = 194). Only 66% of those randomized to MS‐T or SB accessed the intervention and were included in analyses with controls; 78% of this sample completed measures subsequent to baseline. Primary intent‐to‐treat (ITT) analyses revealed no differences between groups, while measure completer analyses found MS‐T had significantly lower EDE‐Q Global than controls at 12‐month follow‐up. Secondary ITT analyses found MS‐T participants reported significantly higher quality of life‐mental relative to both SB and controls (6‐month follow‐up), while MS‐T and controls had lower clinical impairment relative to SB (post‐program). Amongst measure completers, MS‐T scored significantly lower than controls and SB on 5 variables. Of those with baseline DE, MS‐T participants were significantly less likely than controls to have DE at 12‐month follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: Given both programs were not therapist‐moderated, MS‐T has potential to achieve reductions in DE risk at low implementation costs.
