	abstract = {Background: Obesity is increasingly a worldwide problem of epidemic proportions (Roberto et al., 2015) and it often shows comorbidity with binge eating disorder (BED), a mental health disorder characterized by uncontrolled consumption of abnormally large amounts of food in a discrete period of time in absence of compensatory weight control methods, such as purging, fasting, or excessive exercise (APA, 2013). Compared with obese individuals without BED, those with BED report greater functional impairment and lower quality of life, as well as significantly greater levels of psychiatric comorbidity (Wilson, 2011). Moreover, obese individuals with BED are more likely to dropout of weight loss treatment and demonstrate lower behavior change self-efficacy than those without BED (Rieger, Wilfley, Stein, Marino, \& Crow, 2005). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most established and researched psychotherapy treatment for BED and obesity (Grilo, 2017). However, research has revealed that CBT has only shown modest success in long-term reduction of BED symptomatology and limited efficacy in promoting weight loss (Vocks et al., 2010). Therefore, it is important to examine alternative treatments to CBT for increased effectiveness in improving BED symptomology, weight loss, and weight loss maintenance (Castelnuovo et al., 2015). Empirical studies have shown brief strategic therapy (BST) to be clinically effective in treating several psychological disorders, including BED (Nardone \& Brook Barbieri, 2010). Also, telemedicine offers advantages in terms of cost and accessibility and has proven effective in promoting weight loss, treatment adherence, and treatment retention among people who are overweight or obese (Sorgente et al., 2017). Objectives: The present randomized control trial (RCT) is amed to evaluate the statistical and clinical effectiveness of BST compared to CBT, one year after a two-phase inpatient and outpatient telemedicine treatment for BED. Methods: Obese Italian women with BED were recruited from a self-referred inpatient treatment program for weight loss (n=60) and randomly assigned to either the BST treatment condition (n=30) or CBT treatment condition (n=30). Inpatient psychotherapy sessions were conducted in person and outpatient telemedicine psychotherapy sessions were conducted over the telephone. Participants were blinded regarding treatment allocation. Treatment duration for both conditions was 7 months. As part of the 1-month inpatient phase, participants in both conditions attended an inpatient weight loss treatment program including eight face-to-face 45-min psychotherapy sessions (2 per week). As part of the 6-month outpatient telemedicine phase, participants received eight telephone psychotherapy sessions (2 sessions per month the first two months after discharge and one session per month for the subsequent four months). Outcomes were assessed at pretreatment (T1), inpatient discharge (T2 - approximately 1 month after the pretreatment measure), posttreatment (T3 - approximately 7 months after the pretreatment measure), 6-month follow-up (T4), and 1-year follow-up (T5). Multilevel growth curve modeling was used to estimate the average pretreatment levels and growth trajectories from baseline to one year after treatment for the following outcomes: average weekly binge episode frequency, weight, and global functioning. Clinical significance was calculated for each outcome by identifying the proportion of participants who demonstrated meaningful change from pretreatment to 12-month posttreatment (Kendall, 1999). Results: Preliminary analyses for between-condition differences indicated there were no significant baseline differences on outcome variables or demographic characteristics between BST participants and CBT participants. BST average weekly binge episode frequency, weight and participant global functioning (as measure by the assessed by the Outcome Questionnaire - OQ-45) were lower than that of CBT at posttreatment, 6-month follow-up, and 1-year fol- low-up. BST was statistically and clinically superior to CBT in improving binge eating frequency, weight, and global functioning. Conclusions: Examining BED given the current obesity epidemic is an important area of study. Findings suggest that stepped-care telemedicine BST approach is statistically and clinically more effective than CBT in treating BED, promoting weight loss, and improving global functioning among obese women one year after treatment. The most likely reason for the results may be the differing BED symptom conceptualization and mechanisms of change behind the BST and CBT interventions: CBT provides problem-focused treatment aimed at helping clients control binge eating by restructuring associated cognitive distortions and replacing maladaptive behavioral patterns with more adaptive eating behavioral patterns, while BST provides solution-focused treatment aimed at helping clients shift the dysfunctional perceptive-reactive system around restricting by replacing dysfunctional attempted solutions with more functional solutions often through paradoxical intervention. Additional research are needed to determine if BST is an empirically supported treatment for BED and obesity, and to confirm the effectiveness of the stepped-care model by comparing BST treatment across various treatment delivery modes.},

	abstract = {Background: Technology-assisted case management (TACM) with medication titration by nurses under physician supervision was shown to be more effective in improving glycemic control and provide a faster rate of decline in levels of HbA1c compared to usual care in low-income rural adults with poorly controlled diabetes. To support implementation in resource poor settings, we conducted a cost analysis to examine whether the intervention was cost-effective compared to usual care. Methods: This was a randomized, controlled trial with participants assigned to control or an intervention involving a telehealth device and a nurse case manager trained to titrate medications every 2 weeks based on an algorithm. The primary outcome was glycemic control (HbA1c) at 6-months post-randomization. Costs were measured using respondents' answers about healthcare utilization prior to and during the intervention. Costs were estimated based on Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) medical expenditure averages for each utilization type. Costs for lost wages were estimate using interval regression and using the fitted values to estimate the cost lost days of work due to illness. All costs were adjusted to 2012 levels using Consumer Price Index (CPI) conversions. Effectiveness was measured as HbA1c calculated via area under the curve. The total costs and HbA1c were used to estimate a joint distribution of incremental costs and incremental effects as well as cost effectiveness acceptability curves. Results were generated using a non-parametrically bootstrapped sample of 1000 to provide confidence intervals. Results: Average total costs for the intervention group (\$ 4,882.80, σ = 7,845.86) were higher than the usual care group (\$ 1,247.03, σ = 1,547.83). However, the decrease in HbA1c was larger in the TACM group (-0.978, σ = 2.063) than the usual care group (-0.2659, σ = 2.166). The corresponding incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated to be \$ 5948.14. Conclusions: Though the intervention costs were higher relative to usual care, low-income individuals receiving technology-assisted case management with medication titration had significantly higher drops in glycemic control, with a corresponding ICER indicating approximately \$ 6,000 per 1\% decrease in HbA1c. Given the growing costs of uncontrolled diabetes both in terms of medical costs and productivity loss, this intervention can be deployed in low resource settings to improve outcomes for low-income individuals with diabetes.},

Health professionals' primary role for chronic pain should be guiding, coaching, and assisting patients with day-to-day self-management. However, they often lack the time and training to perform this role, and there is limited research on self-management approaches. This transformative care model integrates robust self-management online training with health and wellness tele-coaching to improve outcomes from self-management of chronic pain. Results: Eighty-one subjects were randomized to PACTand TSC, 1 subject withdraw from the study. Mean age was 47 (SD=16), 86\% were female, and 82\% had pain onset of 1 year or more. Participants showed significant improvement in measures of pre-post change at 8 weeks for pain severity (PACT -.94 vs TSC -0.5), but not for pain interference or jaw functioning (16 week follow-up data are still in collection at the time of this submission but will be completed and included at the time of the conference). Conclusions: This research demonstrated that transformative care model that includes tele-health coaching and online training is both feasible and effective. It provides an accessible, scalable, and transferable method for self-management that can be integrated into routine care without increasing the burden of time demands upon the providers.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Different studies investigating telehealth care (THC) for COPD have shown conflicting results. We published a feasibility trial, which showed excellent patient adherence and satisfaction with our THC approach1. Here, we present an interim analysis of the consecutive international randomised-controlled trial. Methods: Patients are randomly assigned to one group with a crossover after 6 months. Patients in the intervention daily answer 6 questions, focused on the early recognition of exacerbations (AECOPD), using Evita by Swisscom (extended for COPD by the study team)1. We daily analyse all entries and react according to a pre-specified action plan. Patients in the control receive standard care without THC. In all, the COPD assessment test (CAT) is measured once weekly. Primary endpoint is HRQOL according to CAT. Results: Currently, 56 of 175 patients have completed the trial. The overall mean CAT score was 15.3 points. During the intervention, the intraindividual CAT was significantly lower than during the control (mean -0.6 points, p = 0.001). 23\% of patients improved their CAT more than 2 points, 62\% were stable and 15\% worsened while being in the intervention phase. Satisfaction with COPD care (visual analogue scale) tended to be better after the intervention as compared to the control (mean 8.8 vs. 8.4 points, p = 0.46). Hospitalisation rate due to AECOPD was 0.18 per patientyear (py) during the intervention vs. 0.25 per py during the control. COPD-related costs were 4619 CHF per py during the intervention vs. 8230 CHF per py during the control. Conclusion: After completing 32\% of 175 patients, we found a discrete but significant improvement of HRQOL as measured by CAT after 6 months of our THC. Satisfaction with care was already high before the intervention and tended to increase further with THC. We found a lower hospitalisation rate during the intervention and consecutively relevantly lower total COPD-related costs.},

This study aimed to investigate the cost-utility of a home-based telerehabilitation program. Methods: A comparative, trial-based, incremental cost-utility analysis was conducted from a health care provider's perspective. We collected data as part of a multi-centre, two-arm, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial with 6 months follow-up. There were 53 participants randomised to either a telerehabilitation program (consisting of 12 weeks of group-based exercise and education delivered into the home via online videoconferencing) or a traditional centre-based program. Health care costs (including personnel, equipment and hospital readmissions due to heart failure) were extracted from health system records, and calculated in Australian dollars using 2013 as the base year. Health utilities were measured using the EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Estimates were presented as means and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) based on bootstrapping. Costs and utility differences were plotted on a cost-effectiveness plane. Results: Total health care costs per participant were significantly lower in the telerehabilitation group (-\$1,590, 95\% CI: −2,822, −359) during the 6 months. No significant differences in quality-adjusted life years (0, 95\% CI: −0.06, 0.05) were seen between the two groups. Conclusions: Heart failure telerehabilitation appears to be less costly and as effective for the health care provider as traditional centre-based rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: IBD affects 1.6 million people in the US and is associated with increased healthcare utilization. Telemedicine is an alternative healthcare delivery system which could improve outcomes and decrease costs. The objective of this study was to compare healthcare utilization 1 year before and after randomization among participants receiving TELE-IBD and standard care. METHODS: The TELEIBD study was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial conducted over 1 year. Controls received standard care whereas TELE-IBD participants completed testing with TELE-IBD weekly (W) or every other week (EOW). Testing consisted of an assessment of symptoms, side effects, and weight, alerts to providers, action plans to participants, and educational messages. Healthcare utilization was assessed by review of the electronic medical record and categorized as office and emergency department visits, diagnostic tests, infusions, procedures and hospitalizations. RESULTS: Total encounters increased in all groups after enrollment; increased utilization was due to significant increases in office visits, infusions, and telephone encounters (Table 1). There was no difference in total encounters between groups. Telephone calls increased significantly from baseline in TELE-IBD EOW and W; however, the difference was not significant between groups. IBD-related hospitalizations increased in controls (22 to 26) but decreased from 27 to 16 in TELE-IBD EOW and 27 to 11 in TELE-IBD W respectively (TELE-IBD W vs. controls, p {\textless}.05). CONCLUSION: Healthcare utilization increased in all groups and was not decreased with use of TELE-IBD. However, use of TELE-IBD W was associated with a significant decrease in IBD-related hospitalizations. Despite more frequent interactions with the care team in TELE-IBD groups, telephone and electronic communications were not increased compared to standard care. Further research is needed to determine if telemedicine can be used to decrease healthcare utilization. (Table Presented).},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Increasing attention has been placed on identifying and validating innovative COPD care models such as Telehealth (TH), particularly for high cost patients with severe COPD and/or frequent acute exacerbations. METHODS: PROMETE II is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial lasting 12-months conducted in five hospitals in Madrid, Spain. Severe stable COPD patients (FEV1 below 50\% predicted and 6 weeks without a COPD exacerbation) were randomized to either a specific monitoring protocol with TH or routine clinical practice (RCP). The main objective was to reduce the number of COPD exacerbations leading to ER visits/hospital admissions. RESULTS: 237 COPD patients were recruited, and 229 (96.6\%) were randomized to TH (n=115) or RCP (n=114). Participants had a mean±SD age of 71±8 years and 80\% were men. There were no statistical differences in the baseline parameters of both groups. There were no statistically significant differences in the primary efficacy analysis of the proportion of participants who had a severe COPD exacerbation leading to ER visits or a hospital admission (59.5\% in TH vs. 55.7\% in RCP; p=0.556). Similarly, the mean number of exacerbations over the 12-month period was comparable between groups, 1.0 in TH vs. 0.9 in RCP (p=0.286). However, there was a non-significant trend towards a shorter mean total duration of hospitalization in the TH group (18.9±16.4 days) compared to the RCP group (22.3±19.7 days), p=0.353, and of fewer days in the ICU, 6.0±4.6 vs.13.3±11.1 days, p=0.349. At month 12, the number of all-cause deaths was comparable between groups (11 in TH vs. 13 in RCP). Lastly, telehealth was evaluated highly positively by both participating physicians and patients. CONCLUSION: We conclude that remote patient management using this monitoring protocol did not reduce the COPD-related ER visits or hospital admissions compared to routine clinical care within 12 months.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Collaborative care is an effective approach for treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression within the US Military Health System (MHS), but its cost-effectiveness remains unstudied. Our objective was to evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of centrally assisted collaborative telecare (CACT) versus optimized usual care (OUC) for PTSD and depression in the MHS. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized trial compared CACT with OUC. Routine primary care screening identified active-duty service members with PTSD or depression. Eligible participants (N = 666) were randomized to CACT or OUC and assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months. OUC patients could receive care management and increased behavioral health support. CACT patients could receive these services plus stepped psychosocial treatment and routine centralized team monitoring. METHODS: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were derived from the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. Claims and case management data were used to estimate costs. Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Data from 629 patients (320 CACT and 309 OUC) with sufficient follow-up were analyzed. CACT patients gained 0.02 QALYs (95\% CI, –0.001 to 0.03) relative to OUC patients. Twelve-month costs, including productivity, were \$987 (95\% CI, –\$3056 to \$5030) higher for CACT versus OUC. CACT was estimated to cost \$49,346 per QALY gained compared with OUC over 12 months. There is a 58\% probability that CACT is cost-effective at a \$100,000/QALY threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its higher costs, CACT appears to be a cost-effective strategy relative to OUC for managing PTSD and depression in the MHS.},

Safety of a web telemanagement system designed for complex IBD patients, TECCU (Telemonitorizacion de la Enfermedad de Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa [Telemonitoring of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis]) and its impact on healthcare utilisation, compared with standard care (G-Control) and nurseassisted telephone care (G-NT) were evaluated. Methods: A 3-arm randomised clinical trial was performed in an academic hospital in Spain. IBD patients aged ≥18 years who initiated therapy with corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and/or biological agents for disease activity were consecutively included. Exclusion criteria were: patients with ileorectal/ileo-pouch anal anastomosis, no Internet access and inability to communicate properly in Spanish. Eligible participants were randomised to receive remote monitoring (G-TECCU), G-NT or G-control for 24 weeks in a 1:1:1 ratio using a web-based program. TECCU is a secured webpage with an HTTPS application for smartphone, tablet and computer. Healthcare resources were measured including the number of outpatient visits and telephone calls attended by healthcare providers. Safety was defined in terms of emergency visits, corticosteroid courses, hospitalisations, and IBD-related surgeries. In addition, the cost of each procedure was assessed using official prices of each health service. Results: 63 patients were included and 21 were randomly assigned to each group. Most patients had CD-14 (66.7\%) in G-control, 13 (61.9\%) in G-NT, and 13 (61.9\%) in G-TECCU. The median of disease progression was 146.7 months (range 7-424) in G-TECCU, 123.3 (6-427) in G-control and 108.3 (7-452) in G-NT, respectively. The percentage of patients treated with immunomodulators was 47.6\% vs. 47.6\% vs. 42.9\% in G-control, G-AT and G-TECCU, respectively, and 47.6\% vs. 42.9\% vs. 47.6\% with biologic mono or combo therapy in G-control, G-AT and G-TECCU, respectively. After 24 weeks, the total number of outpatient visits and phone calls was lower in the G-TECCU (72 visits, 12 phone calls) compared with G-AT (85 visits, 118 phone calls) and G-control (131 visits, 47 phone calls), which represent a cost of 3205 vs. 5342 vs. 6210 euros in G-TECCU vs. G-AT vs. G-control, respectively. There were not differences among groups in the number of emergency visits, IBDrelated surgeries, hospitalisations, use of corticosteroids and medication adverse effects during the study period. Conclusions: TECCU web program is a safe and innovative tool for management of complex IBD patients, which reduce health care costs in terms of outpatient visits and phone calls.},

	abstract = {Background: IBD affects 1.6 million people in the US and is associated with increased healthcare utilization. Telemedicine is an alternative healthcare delivery system which could improve outcomes and decrease costs. The objective of this study was to compare healthcare utilization 1 year before and after randomization among participants receiving TELE-IBD and standard care. Methods: The TELE-IBD study was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial conducted over 1 year. Controls received standard care whereas TELE-IBD participants completed testing with TELE-IBD weekly (W) or every other week (EOW). Testing consisted of an assessment of symptoms, side effects, and weight, alerts to providers, action plans to participants, and educational messages. Healthcare utilization was assessed by review of the electronic medical record and categorized as office and emergency department visits, diagnostic tests, infusions, procedures and hospitalizations. Results: Total encounters increased in all groups after enrollment; increased utilization was due to significant increases in office visits, infusions, and telephone encounters (Table 1). There was no difference in total encounters between groups. Telephone calls increased significantly from baseline in TELE-IBD EOW and W; however, the difference was not significant between groups. IBD-related hospitalizations increased in controls (22 to 26) but decreased from 27 to 16 in TELE-IBD EOW and 27 to 11 in TELE-IBD W respectively (TELE-IBD W vs. controls, p {\textless}.05). Conclusion: Healthcare utilization increased in all groups and was not decreased with use of TELE-IBD. However, use of TELE-IBD W was associated with a significant decrease in IBD-related hospitalizations. Despite more frequent interactions with the care team in TELE-IBD groups, telephone and electronic communications were not increased compared to standard care. Further research is needed to determine if telemedicine can be used to decrease healthcare utilization. (Table presented).},

	abstract = {Aims: The growing incidence of diabetes and the need to contain healthcare costs empower the necessity to identify new models of care. Telemedicine offers an acknowledged instrument to provide clinical health care at a distance, increasing patient compliance and the achievement of therapeutical goals. The objective was to test the feasibility and the efficacy in the improvement of the glycemic control of the teleconsultation for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Methods: A randomized open-label, parallel arms, controlled trial was conducted in two diabetes centers in Italy. Participants affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus have been randomly (1:1) assigned to receive their visits as standard or a web-based care. Patients in the teleconsultation group can arrange their appointments on a Web site and can also have access to web educational courses or to nutritional and psychological counseling. The primary outcome was the assessment of glycemic control by HbA1c measurement after a 12-month follow-up. Results: Overall 74 participants were followed for 1 year. HbA1c changes were not statistically different within (p = 0.56 for standard care group; p = 0.45 for telemedicine group) and between (p = 0.60) groups when considering differences from baseline to the end of the study. Patients randomized to teleconsultation reported reduced severe hypoglycemic episodes (p = 0.03). In addition, they were largely satisfied with the activities, perceived a good improvement in the self-management of the diabetes, and reported to have a time saving and a cost reduction. Conclusions: In conclusion, TELEDIABE proposes a new system for the management of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.},

	abstract = {Background: Conventional follow-up of teenagers with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is done during scheduled outpatient visits regardless of how well the patient feels. We designed a telemonitoring strategy for early recognition of flares and compared its efficacy with conventional follow-up. (Figure presented) Methods: Multicentre randomised trial in children aged 10-19 years with IBD in clinical remission at baseline. Participants assigned to telemonitoring received automated alerts to complete a symptom score and send a stool sample for calprotectin measurement. This resulted in an individual prediction for flare with associated treatment advice and test interval. In conventional follow-up the health check interval was left to the physician's discretion. Primary endpoint was cumulative incidence of disease flares. Secondary endpoints were percentage of participants with a positive change in quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Results: We included 170 participants (84 telemonitoring; 86 conventional follow-up). At 52 weeks the mean number of face-to-face visits was significantly lower in the telemonitoring group compared with conventional follow-up (3.6 vs. 4.3, p {\textless} 0.001). The incidence of flares (33 vs. 34\%) and the proportion of participants reporting positive change in quality-of-life (56\% vs. 46\%) were similar. Mean annual cost-saving was 89 and increased to 360 in those compliant to the protocol. Conclusions: Telemonitoring is as safe as conventional follow-up, reduces outpatient visits and societal costs. This strategy is attractive for teenagers and families, and health professionals may be interested in using it to keep teenagers who are well out of hospital and ease pressure on overstretched outpatient services.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Socially assistive robots are being developed for patients to help manage chronic health conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Adherence to medication and availability of rehabilitation are suboptimal in this patient group, which increases the risk of hospitalization. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a robot delivering telehealth care to increase adherence to medication and home rehabilitation, improve quality of life, and reduce hospital readmission compared with a standard care control group. METHODS: At discharge from hospital for a COPD admission, 60 patients were randomized to receive a robot at home for 4 months or to a control group. Number of hospitalization days for respiratory admissions over the 4-month study period was the primary outcome. Medication adherence, frequency of rehabilitation exercise, and quality of life were also assessed. Implementation interviews as well as benefit-cost analysis were conducted. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses showed no significant differences in the number of respiratory-related hospitalizations between groups. The intervention group was more adherent to their long-acting inhalers (mean number of prescribed puffs taken per day=48.5\%) than the control group (mean 29.5\%, P=.03, d=0.68) assessed via electronic recording. Self-reported adherence was also higher in the intervention group after controlling for covariates (P=.04). The intervention group increased their rehabilitation exercise frequency compared with the control group (mean difference -4.53, 95\% CI -7.16 to -1.92). There were no significant differences in quality of life. Of the 25 patients who had the robot, 19 had favorable attitudes. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that a homecare robot can improve adherence to medication and increase exercise. Further research is needed with a larger sample size to further investigate effects on hospitalizations after improvements are made to the robots. The robots could be especially useful for patients struggling with adherence.

	abstract = {Introduction.- Eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by disturbed eating patterns and undue influence of body shape and weight on self-evaluation. Four prominent symptoms in EDs are: restrictive eating, binge eating, purging and excessive exercise. Research has shown that app-based treatment can reduce ED-pathology and that symptom reduction is similar to traditional face-to-face treatment. An app-intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) combined with regular video consultations has not previously been developed and used for these four ED-symptoms. Objectives.- The aim of the study was to develop a CBT appintervention supplemented by weekly video-consultations with a psychologist for persons suffering from restrictive eating, binge eating, purging or excessive exercise. Methods.- We conducted a feasibility study aiming to develop and pilot-test the treatment model consisting of a 10-week CBT program with app-interventions and psychotherapeutic video consultations. Results.- The psychotherapeutic content of the app (including assessment, psychoeducation, exposure therapy and motivation to change) and the development of the app-design will be presented, as will the preliminary results of the pilot-test on 10 patients. Conclusions.- The combination of an app and psychotherapeutic video consultations may be effective in the treatment of restrictive eating, binge eating, purging or exercise addiction. Furthermore, Internet-based ED-treatment makes treatment accessibility easier and may spare economical costs and travel time. The next part of this study is designed to evaluate the effect of the treatment in a randomized controlled trial addressing symptom reduction, quality of life and the participants' experience with technology-based treatment.},

Aims: eSMART aims to evaluate the short- and long-term impact of ASyMS, compared with standard care, on patient reported outcomes and the delivery of care. Additionally, eSMART includes economic evaluation and the development of predictive risk models for experiencing CT-related symptoms to enable personalised and anticipatory care. Methods: Patients newly diagnosed with breast, haematological, or colo-rectal cancer and scheduled to receive at least 3 cycles of chemotherapy are recruited across 5 countries and 13 clinical sites. A total of 1108 patients will be randomised to either ASyMS or standard care. Patient demographic and clinical data are collected at baseline, and standardised PROMS are completed at baseline, during 6 cycles of chemotherapy and every 3 months for up to 12 months. The primary outcome measure is the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Secondary measures include: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General, Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form 34, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Communication and Attitudinal Self-Efficacy scale for cancer, Work limitations Questionnaire, EuroQol, and Client Services-Receipt Inventory. Results: RCT data collection started in May 2016, and to date, 537 patients have been recruited. This presentation will provide an overview of the trial aims and design and reflect on study progress and challenges within the United Kingdom and wider European context. Conclusions: Setting up this multicentre study has been challenging, but eSMART is breaking new ground in multinational ehealth research.

	abstract = {Purpose: Although self-measurement of home blood pressure (HBP) is common in Japan and HBP telemonitoring via the Internet is possible, whether telemonitoring improves HBP control better than conventional practice remains unclear. Furthermore, hypertension care with online communication using telemonitored HBP is feasible, whereas the efficacy and safety of such telemedicine have not been established. We aim to compare traditional care, care with office visits using HBP telemonitoring, and antihypertensive telemedicine based on HBP telemonitoring. Methods and design: In total, 444 patients with uncontrolled hypertension will be recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: (1) control: usual care with office visits and HBP self-report, (2) telemonitoring: weekly assessment of transmitted HBP by physicians and treatment adjustment upon office visits, or (3) telemedicine: online communication instead of office visits to adjust medication using telemonitored HBP. Primary outcome is the time to control of HBP, and secondary outcomes include achieved HBP levels, adherence, treatment intensity, adverse events, patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness. Discussion: Hypertension care with telemonitoring and telemedicine are expected to require shorter time to achieve HBP control compared to usual care. Combining HBP telemonitoring with telemedicine may lower the hurdles for starting and persisting to hypertension treatment and eventually reduce cardiovascular events.},

	abstract = {Objective: To demonstrate the feasibility, reliability, and value of conducting virtual research visits in individuals with Parkinson disease (PD). Background: Increasing interest has focused on the use of virtual research visits given the rising cost and difficulties with recruitment and retention in clinical trials. Virtual research visits have the potential to reduce infrastructure costs, expedite recruitment, and improve retention through improved accessibility and convenience of trial participation. Design/Methods: We are conducting an add-on study of 40 individuals with PD enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial STEADY-PD III. Enrolled participants complete 3 virtual visits over 1 year using a smartphone equipped with telehealth software from AMC Health. Visits occur within four weeks of inperson trial visits. All trial assessments performed at the preceding in-person visit are performed remotely. Study outcomes include (1) feasibility determined by the ability to conduct remote assessments; (2) reliability of remote assessments compared to inperson assessments; (3) value of virtual visits measured by patient and provider preference. The study will also evaluate the ability of virtual visits to detect change in outcome measures over time. Results: 40 participants were enrolled, and 38 participants remain active in the study. To date, 95 televisits have been completed, with 91\% completed in window. All active participants have completed at least 2 visits, and 19 (50\%) have completed study participation. The last virtual visit is expected in March, 2018. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the UPDRS part 3 was 0.37. ICCs for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MDS-UPDRS part IA, and part IB were 0.78, 0.61, and 0.82, respectively. ICC of the MDS-UPDRS part 3 was 0.59. Conclusions: Preliminary results indicate that virtual research visits are feasible in individuals with PD. The low ICC for motor outcomes is likely driven by poor inter-rater reliability, as a single in-person rater accounts for the greatest outlier data points.},

Methods: We conducted a multicenter observational cohort study comparing claims data for potentially avoidable costs, hospital admissions, and complications for 90 days after discharge following hip and knee arthroplasties at 10 practice sites in CA and NV. One hundred eighty-six patients, enrolled between 2014 and 2016 on an automated DPE platform receiving guidance and remote monitoring perioperatively, were compared with 372 patients who underwent the same procedures from the same physicians within 3 years immediately preceding platform implementation. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with \$0.00 in 90-day target costs because of potentially avoidable utilization within the platform's influence. Secondary end points included rates of potentially avoidable 90-day hospital admissions and composite complications. Results: Ninety-three percent and 84.7\% of the study and baseline cohorts, respectively, had \$0.00 in target costs (P =.004), with a mean savings of \$656.52/patient (P =.006).

	abstract = {Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition that is widely underdiagnosed. In adults ranging from 30 to 70 years of age, it is estimated that the prevalence of OSA is 26 percent. Many patients are undiagnosed, and access to evaluation is limited due to geographic concerns and the paucity of sleep specialists. Telemedicine visits may allow for greater access to this care. Patient-centered care and satisfaction surveys are an important way to better assess patient needs. Methods: Subjects ranging from 30-70 years of age, with a variety of sleep concerns, were recruited from the University of Rochester sleep center as part of an inter-rater reliability study. Subjects were evaluated in-person and online. During the telemedicine encounter, a separate, randomized provider performed an independent evaluation for OSA via tele-video conferencing with the subject. Following this encounter, subjects were given a link to an online survey to complete regarding their experience. Results: Of 50 subjects that were recruited to date, 28 (56\%) successfully completed the telemedicine encounter and online survey. Of these patients, 82\% had never before had a telemedicine encounter with a provider. However, 75\% had communicated with their provider through a secure email program at some point and 32\% did this routinely. The majority, 82\%, of subjects felt comfortable conducting a new patient appointment for their sleep medicine concerns via telemedicine, and 75\% thought telemedicine would make it easier to make their appointments. Only 7\% of subjects surveyed would not be interested in having online appointments with their sleep medicine provider, and 64\% would be interested if it were the same cost or even a little bit more than their current co-pay. Conclusion: These results suggest that patients are comfortable with telemedicine appointments for evaluation of OSA, and find it convenient to make these appointments. Telemedicine may improve access for evaluation of OSA, without reducing patient satisfaction, especially if these appointments are financially comparable to an in-person visit.},

Qualitative interviews were conducted with patients and counselors to assess acceptability. Of the 20 male patients randomized to telephone, 90\% received counseling and provided outcomes; of the 18 randomized to televideo, 67\% received counseling and 50\% provided outcomes. Telephone patients answered a mean of 4.4 of eight questions correctly at baseline and 4.7 at follow-up; televideo means were 5.6 and 6.5, respectively. Satisfaction was 25.2 out of 30 for telephone and 26.9 for televideo. Televideo patients incurred a median of 2.8 h of travel time, 40 roundtrip miles, and \$67.29 in costs. Patients and counselors found both modes acceptable for providing education and answering questions. Although patients liked the flexibility of telephone, counselors felt patients missed more appointments and were distracted when using telephone. A noted advantage of videoconferencing was reading body language. Further evaluation of alternative delivery modes is needed.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The development of tablet computers and user-friendly videoconferencing applications has made telemedicine a practical tool for physicians to potentially meet the growing demands of modern healthcare. Our study aimed to compare post-operative outcomes and patient satisfaction scores among patients who are seen in person (Standard Care, SC) versus those seen via videoconferencing (VC) by their surgeon in the hospital. METHODS: Patients undergoing elective urologic surgery requiring inpatient admission were randomized to SC or VC during their hospital stay. All patients were physically examined by urology residents under the supervision of the attending surgeon at the bedside (SC) or by iPad (VC). The attending was prompted to evaluate the patient in person by any significant change in clinical status. The primary outcome was 30- day complication rate. Secondary outcomes included severity of complications, 30-day readmission rate, patient satisfaction, length of stay, number of laboratory and imaging tests obtained, and number of encounters by the attending surgeon. Two-sample t-test was used to compare continuous variables, and chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare categorical variables. RESULTS: Of the 106 patients recruited, 102 patients were included for analysise with 49 patients randomized to SC and 53 patients to VC. Four patients were excluded due to intraoperative findings which precluded an inpatient admission. Age, gender and racial distribution, body-mass index, Charlson-Age Comorbidity Index, American Society of Anesthesiologists scores, type of surgery, and estimated blood loss were similar between groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall complication rate (26.5\% v 17\%, p=0.24) or readmission rate (10.2\% v 5.7\%, p=0.39). Interestingly, the average number of laboratory tests ordered were higher in the SC group (7.2 vs 4.4, p = 0.038). Other secondary outcomes were similar between groups (see Table). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that VC rounds is a safe alternative to bedside hospital rounds in the routine care of urologic postoperative patients. Furthermore, there was no difference in patient satisfaction scores between the two groups. Telerounding is a cost effective and efficient means to manage postoperative urological inpatients.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Conventional follow-up of teenagers with inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] is done during scheduled outpatient visits regardless of how well the patient feels. We designed a telemonitoring strategy for early recognition of flares and compared its efficacy with conventional follow-up. Methods: We used a multicentre randomized trial in patients aged 10-19 years with IBD in clinical remission at baseline. Participants assigned to telemonitoring received automated alerts to complete a symptom score and send a stool sample for measurement of calprotectin. This resulted in an individual prediction for flare with associated treatment advice and test interval. In conventional follow-up the health check interval was left to the physician's discretion. The primary endpoint was cumulative incidence of disease flares. Secondary endpoints were percentage of participants with a positive change in quality-of-life and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Results: We included 170 participants [84 telemonitoring; 86 conventional follow-up]. At 52 weeks the mean number of face-to-face visits was significantly lower in the telemonitoring group compared to conventional follow-up [3.6 vs 4.3, p {\textless} 0.001]. The incidence of flares [33 vs 34\%, p = 0.93] and the proportion of participants reporting positive change in quality-of-life [54 vs 44\%, p = 0.27] were similar. Mean annual cost-saving was €89 and increased to €360 in those compliant to the protocol. Conclusions: Telemonitoring is as safe as conventional follow-up, and reduces outpatient visits and societal costs. The positive impact on quality-of-life was similar in the two groups. This strategy is attractive for teenagers and families, and health professionals may be interested in using it to keep teenagers who are well out of hospital and ease pressure on overstretched outpatient services.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about how individuals engage with electronic health (eHealth) interventions over time and whether this engagement predicts health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study, by using the example of a specific type of eHealth intervention (ie, websites for smoking cessation), were to determine (1) distinct groups of log-in trajectories over a 12-month period, (2) their association with smoking cessation, and (3) baseline user characteristics that predict trajectory group membership. METHODS: We conducted a functional clustering analysis of 365 consecutive days of log-in data from both arms of a large (N=2637) randomized trial of 2 website interventions for smoking cessation (WebQuit and Smokefree), with a primary outcome of 30-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at 12 months. We conducted analyses for each website separately. RESULTS: A total of 3 distinct trajectory groups emerged for each website. For WebQuit, participants were clustered into 3 groups: 1-week users (682/1240, 55.00\% of the sample), 5-week users (399/1240, 32.18\%), and 52-week users (159/1240, 12.82\%). Compared with the 1-week users, the 5- and 52-week users had 57\% higher odds (odds ratio [OR] 1.57, 95\% CI 1.13-2.17; P=.007) and 124\% higher odds (OR 2.24, 95\% CI 1.45-3.43; P{\textless}.001), respectively, of being abstinent at 12 months. Smokefree users were clustered into 3 groups: 1-week users (645/1309, 49.27\% of the sample), 4-week users (395/1309, 30.18\%), and 5-week users (269/1309, 20.55\%). Compared with the 1-week users, 5-week users (but not 4-week users; P=.99) had 48\% higher odds (OR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.05-2.07; P=.02) of being abstinent at 12 months. In general, the WebQuit intervention had a greater number of weekly log-ins within each of the 3 trajectory groups as compared with those of the Smokefree intervention. Baseline characteristics associated with trajectory group membership varied between websites. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of 1-, 4-, and 5-week usage of websites may be common for how people engage in eHealth interventions. The 5-week usage of either website, and 52-week usage only of WebQuit, predicted a higher odds of quitting smoking. Strategies to increase eHealth intervention engagement for 4 more weeks (ie, from 1 week to 5 weeks) could be highly cost effective.

Methods and results A randomized, single-blind, crossover, controlled trial in 48 AF patients on once or twice daily (OD or BID) NOAC. The Medication Event Monitoring System tracked NOAC intake during three phases of 3 months each: daily telemonitoring, telemonitoring with immediate telephone feedback in case of intake errors, and an observation phase without daily transmissions. Unprotected days were defined as ≥ 3 or ≥ 1 consecutively missed doses for a BID or OD NOAC, respectively, or excess dose intake. Cost-effectiveness was calculated based on anticipated stroke reduction derived from patients' risk profile and measured intake. Persistence over the entire study was 98\%. Telemonitoring-only already led to very high taking and regimen adherence (97.4\% respectively 93.8\%). Nevertheless, direct feedback further improved both to 99.0\% and 96.8\%, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001 respectively P = 0.002). Observation without daily monitoring resulted in a significant waning of taking adherence (94.3\%; P = 0.049). Taking adherence was significantly higher for OD compared to BID NOAC, although unprotected days were similar. Feedback intervention had an incremental cost of €344 289 to prevent one stroke, but this could be as low as €15 488 in high-risk patients with low adherence and optimized technology. Conclusion Telemonitoring resulted in high NOAC adherence due to the notion of being watched, as evidenced by the rapid decline during the observation period. Feedback further optimized adherence. Telemonitoring with or without feedback may be a cost-effective approach in high-risk patients deemed poorly adherent.},

Internet-based self-help formats may increase the utilization of treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based, app-supported stress management intervention for college students. METHODS: College students (n=150) with elevated levels of stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4-item version, PSS-4 ≥8) were randomly assigned to either an internet- and mobile-based stress intervention group with feedback on demand or a waitlist control group. Self-report data were assessed at baseline, posttreatment (7 weeks), and 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome was perceived stress posttreatment (PSS-4). Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and college-related outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted in students with clinically relevant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale {\textgreater}17). RESULTS: A total of 106 participants (76.8\%) indicated that they were first-time help-seekers, and 77.3\% (intervention group: 58/75; waitlist control group: 58/75) showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline. Findings indicated significant effects of the intervention compared with the waitlist control group for stress (d=0.69; 95\% CI 0.36-1.02), anxiety (d=0.76; 95\% CI 0.43-1.09), depression (d=0.63; 95\% CI 0.30-0.96), college-related productivity (d=0.33; 95\% CI 0.01-0.65), academic work impairment (d=0.34; 95\% CI 0.01-0.66), and other outcomes after 7 weeks (posttreatment). Response rates for stress symptoms were significantly higher for the intervention group (69\%, 52/75) compared with the waitlist control group (35\%, 26/75, P{\textless}.001; number needed to treat=2.89, 95\% CI 2.01-5.08) at posttest (7 weeks). Effects were sustained at 3-month follow-up, and similar findings emerged in students with symptoms of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Internet- and mobile-based interventions could be an effective and cost-effective approach to reduce consequences of college-related stress and might potentially attract students with clinically relevant depression who would not otherwise seek help.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the treatment of depression, primary care teams have an essential role, but they are most effective when inserted into a collaborative care model for disease management. In rural areas, the shortage of specialized mental health resources may hamper management of depressed patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a remote collaborative care program for patients with depression living in rural areas. METHODS: In a nonrandomized, open-label (blinded outcome assessor), two-arm clinical trial, physicians from 15 rural community hospitals recruited 250 patients aged 18 to 70 years with a major depressive episode (DSM-IV criteria). Patients were assigned to the remote collaborative care program (n=111) or to usual care (n=139). The remote collaborative care program used Web-based shared clinical records between rural primary care teams and a specialized/centralized mental health team, telephone monitoring of patients, and remote supervision by psychiatrists through the Web-based shared clinical records and/or telephone. Depressive symptoms, health-related quality of life, service use, and patient satisfaction were measured 3 and 6 months after baseline assessment. RESULTS: Six-month follow-up assessments were completed by 84.4\% (221/250) of patients. The remote collaborative care program achieved higher user satisfaction (odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95\% CI 1.25-3.00) and better treatment adherence rates (OR 1.81, 95\% CI 1.02-3.19) at 6 months compared to usual care. There were no statically significant differences in depressive symptoms between the remote collaborative care program and usual care. Significant differences between groups in favor of remote collaborative care program were observed at 3 months for mental health-related quality of life (beta 3.11, 95\% CI 0.19-6.02). CONCLUSIONS: Higher rates of treatment adherence in the remote collaborative care program suggest that technology-assisted interventions may help rural primary care teams in the management of depressive patients. Future cost-effectiveness studies are needed.

	abstract = {Background: Fatigue is a frequently occurring, often disabling symptom in MS with no single effective treatment. In current fatigue management interventions, personalized, real-time follow-up is often lacking. The objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of the MS TeleCoach, a novel intervention offering telemonitoring of fatigue and telecoaching of physical activity and energy management in persons with MS (pwMS) over a 12-week period. The goal of the MS TeleCoach, conceived as a combination of monitoring, self-management and motivational messages, is to enhance levels of physical activity thereby improving fatigue in pwMS in an accessible and interactive way, reinforcing self-management of patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective, open-label feasibility study of the MS TeleCoach in pwMS with Expanded Disability Status Scale ≤ 4 and moderate to severe fatigue as measured by the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC). Following a 2-week run-in period to assess the baseline activity level per patient, the target number of activity counts was gradually increased over the 12-week period through telecoaching. The primary efficacy outcome was change in FSMC total score from baseline to study end. A subset of patients was asked to fill in D-QUEST 2.0, a usability questionnaire, to evaluate the satisfaction with the MS TeleCoach device and the experienced service. Results: Seventy-five patients were recruited from 16 centres in Belgium, of which 57 patients (76\%) completed the study. FSMC total score (p = 0.009) and motor and cognitive subscores (p = 0.007 and p = 0.02 respectively) decreased from baseline to week 12, indicating an improvement in fatigue. One third of participants with severe fatigue changed to a lower FSMC category for both FSMC total score and subscores. The post-study evaluation of patient satisfaction showed that the intervention was well accepted and that patients were very satisfied with the quality of the professional services. Conclusion: Using MS TeleCoach as a self-management tool in pwMS suffering from mild disability and moderate to severe fatigue appeared to be feasible, both technically and from a content perspective. Its use was associated with improved fatigue levels in the participants who completed the study. The MS Telecoach seems to meet the need for a low-cost, accessible and interactive self-management tool in MS.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Occupational/physical therapy improves poststroke outcomes in a dose-dependent manner. However, many patients receive suboptimal therapy doses for reasons that include cost, availability, and difficulty with travel. This problem is likely to increase with time given the aging population and increased post-stroke survival rates. Telehealth, defined as the delivery of health-related services and information via telecommunication technologies, can potentially address this unmet need. The current study examined the effect of a home-based telerehabilitation program designed to improve motor recovery and patient education in patients with stroke. Method: Using a randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled, non-inferiority clinical trial, a total of 124 participants were enrolled across 11 US centers as part of the NIH StrokeNet clinical trials network. Entry criteria included arm motor deficits (arm motor Fugl-Meyer (FM) score 22-56 /66), stroke onset 4-36 weeks prior, and age ±18. Those with significant depression, cognitive impairment, or communication deficits were excluded. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive 6 weeks of intensive arm motor therapy either (a) in a traditional in-clinic setting or (b) via in-home telerehabilitation (rehabilitation services delivered to the subject's home via an internet-connected computer).

	abstract = {Objectives: The Philadelphia Telemedicine Glaucoma Detection and Follow-up Study is a CDC-funded prospective randomized controlled trial comparing a social worker intervention (enhanced intervention, EI) to address individual and systemic barriers to ophthalmology care versus usual care (UC). The study investigates the effect of EI on adherence to recommended follow-up eyecare in underserved Philadelphia communities. Study objectives include determining incremental cost-effectiveness of EI versus UC using health utilities derived from the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25). Objective of this analysis was to assess differences in baseline utility by demographics. Methods: Baseline demographics and NEI-VFQ-25 responses were collected for subjects randomized into the study. Demographics were assessed using descriptive statistics, and baseline utility scores (VFQ-UI) were derived from NEI-VFQ-25 responses using a validated algorithm. T-tests and ANOVA were used to assess statistical significance of differences between mean VFQ-UI by gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, and diabetic history. Results: The sample comprised 340 subjects, n= 171 randomized to EI and n= 169 randomized UC. Mean age of the entire sample was 60.65 years (SD ±11.03), 59.1\% were female, 65.0\% were African American, and 55.9\% reported history of diabetes. Mean sample VFQ-UI was 0.864 (SD ±0.111); mean EI VFQ-UI was 0.866 (SD: ±0.112) versus 0.862 (SD ±0.111) for UC. VFQ-UI was not statistically different by study group (p= 0.790). No statistical differences were identified in the mean reported VFQ-UI by gender (p= 0.215) or diabetes status (p= 0.604). Race, ethnicity, and marital status significantly impacted VFQ-UI (p= {\textless} 0.001, 0.005, 0.009, respectively). Conclusions: Mean VFQ-UI is generally high at baseline and did not statistically differ by study group; however, statistically significant differences were seen by race, ethnicity, and marital status, suggesting that changes in utility during the clinical trial should be measured for relevant subgroups. Future work entails evaluating change in VFQ-UI at 18 and 36 months.},

	abstract = {Objective: Postoperative vascular discharge complications result in increased hospital readmissions, cost, and patient dissatisfaction. Telehealth technology to monitor patients, especially those in geographically isolated areas, should reduce postoperative complications and improve health and financial outcomes. The primary objective was to compare outcomes between patients who received telehealth electronic monitoring (THEM) and those with routine discharge instructions and no monitoring (standard of care). Methods: Thiswas a prospective randomized study of vascular surgery patients with groin incisions. THEMpatients received a tablet and homemonitoring devices that transmitted information to care managers. Monitoring tools includedimage capture,weight scales, bloodpressure cuffs, thermometers, and oxygen saturation monitors (Fig 1). Care managers used the TeleMed 2020 (Indianapolis, Ind) Enform platform to review alerts, real-time patient data, and dialogue with the care team(Fig 2). Results: Thirty patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 16 (53.3\%) were randomized to THEM and 14 (46.7\%) to control groups. Average age and body mass index for THEM and control patients were similar (62.5 ± 7.2 years vs 65.7 ± 7.3 years [P = .234]; and 27.7 ± 4.3 kg/m2 vs 29.1 ± 7.1 kg/m2 [P = .487]). THEM patients had significantly more hypercholesterolemia (93.8\% vs 50.0\%; P = .012). There were no significant differences in wound or any 30-day readmissions (6.3\% vs 7.1\% [P = 1.000]; and 25.0\% vs 14.3\% [P = .657]). Interestingly, 30-day infection rates indicated care managers identified marginally more superficial wounds in the THEM group (31.3\% vs 7.1\%; P = .175). Both groups reported an increase in the 8-Item Short Form Health Survey physical summary scores, but it was more pronounced in THEM patients (P = .076). THEM patients reported a significantly greater improvement in quality of life on two of the 8-Item Short Form Health Survey quality subscales (roledphysical [THEM, 8.7; control, 1.1] and roleeemotional [THEM, 6.1; control, 0.5]; both P {\textless} .05). THEM patients reported trends for higher satisfaction in terms of general satisfaction, technical quality, and accessibility for Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form survey questions (4.2 vs 3.7 [P = .72], 4.5 vs 4.1 [P = .81], and 4.2 vs 3.8 [P = .63]), respectively. Conclusions: THEM was technically feasible and provided significant benefit to patients in geographically disparate areas. THEM was associated with increased patient satisfaction. Additional findings suggested that THEM patients embraced telehealth technology and took advantage of increased access to health care professionals. Telehealth successfully merged remotely generated information with care manager interaction. Presently, a larger study, preferably multicenter, is warranted and under consideration.},

Objective: To assess whether augmenting usual primary care with team-based intensive management lowers utilization and costs for high-risk patients. Design: Randomized quality improvement trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03100526) Setting: 5 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. Patients: Primary care patients at high risk for hospitalization who had a recent acute care episode. Intervention: Locally tailored intensive management programs providing care coordination, goals assessment, health coaching, medication reconciliation, and home visits through an interdisciplinary team, including a physician or nurse practitioner, a nurse, and psychosocial experts. Measurements: Utilization and costs (including intensive management program expenses) 12 months before and after randomization. Results: 2210 patients were randomly assigned, 1105 to intensive management and 1105 to usual care. Patients had a mean age of 63 years and an average of 7 chronic conditions; 90\% were men. Of the patients assigned to intensive management, 487 (44\%) received intensive outpatient care (that is, ≥3 encounters in person or by telephone) and 204 (18\%) received limited intervention. From the pre- to postrandomization periods, mean inpatient costs decreased more for the intensive management than the usual care group (\$2164 [95\% CI, \$7916 to \$3587]). Outpatient costs increased more for the intensive management than the usual care group (\$2636 [CI, \$524 to \$4748]), driven by greater use of primary care, home care, telephone care, and telehealth. Mean total costs were similar in the 2 groups before and after randomization. Limitations: Sites took up to several months to contact eligible patients, limiting the time between treatment and outcome assessment. Only VA costs were assessed. Conclusion: High-risk patients with access to an intensive management program received more outpatient care with no increase in total costs.},

	abstract = {Background Telerehabilitation promises to improve quality, increase patient access and reduce costs in health care. Physiotherapy with exercises is generally recommended to restore function after surgery in patients with chronic subacromial syndrome. Relatively few studies have investigated the feasibility of telerehabilitation interventions in musculoskeletal and orthopaedic disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a customizable telerehabilitation intervention and compare with traditional care. Methods This research includes 18 consecutive patients with subacromial impingement who underwent arthroscopic subacromial decompression in a controlled clinical prospective study. Patients were randomized to either a 12-week telerehabilitation programme or the usual face-to-face physical therapy for immediate postoperative rehabilitation. We have developed a telerehabilitation system to provide services to patients who have undergone shoulder arthroscopy. An independent blinded observer performed postoperative follow-up after 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Results The preliminary efficacy of this telerehabilitation programme in terms of both physical and functional objective outcome measures was assessed on eight patients. Using the Constant-Murley score to evaluate functional outcome, patients in the telerehabilitation group were shown to have improved from a mean 43.50 ± 3.21 points to a mean 68.50 ± 0.86 points after 12 weeks. The physical and functional improvements in the telerehabilitation group were similar to those in the control group ( p = 0.213). There was a non-significant trend for greater improvements in the telerehabilitation group for most outcome measurements. Conclusion The results of this study provide evidence for the efficacy of telerehabilitation after shoulder arthroscopy in shoulder impingement syndrome. A telerehabilitation programme with range of motion, strengthening of the rotator cuff and scapula stabilizers exercises seems to be similar and not inferior to traditional face-to-face physiotherapy after subacromial arthroscopic decompression. Through this study, we are developing our preliminary dataset to evaluate the efficacy of telerehabilitation programmes following surgical procedures in musculoskeletal injuries and for comparison with more traditional interventions.},

Our aim was to explore the effects of telemedicine supported GDM care on a range of health service utilisation and maternal and foetal outcomes. Methods: An exploratory randomised controlled trial of adjunct telemedicine support in the management of insulin-treated GDM compared to usual care control. Outcomes included health service use, maternal and foetal clinical outcomes as well as costs. Groups were compared on outcomes and Poisson and Cox regression analysis were performed for predictors of health service utilisation, glycaemic control and costs. Results: 95 participants were recruited (intervention n = 61, control n = 34). There were no differences between the groups in number of face-to-face appointments (median (IQR) intervention = 8(7), control = 8(6), p = 0.843), rates of caesareans, macrosomia, large for gestational age, special care nursery admission or newborn birth-weight. The intervention had no impact on total (IRR = 1.04, p = 0.596) or face-to-face (IRR = 1.09, p = 0.257) clinic appointments or service provider costs. Participants receiving the intervention reached optimum glycaemic control quicker: mean (SD) 4.3(4.2) weeks vs. 7.6(4.5) weeks, p = 0.0001). Telemedicine was a significant predictor of better glycaemic control (HR = 1.71(95\%CI: 1.11, 2.65, p = 0.015). Conclusions: Telemedicine support for GDM care showed no impact on service utilisation and costs. The intervention produced similar GDM clinical outcomes as usual care and posed no added risk to clinical quality of care. The intervention may be associated with fewer insulin dose titrations and participants achieved optimum glycaemic control sooner.},

	abstract = {Home phototherapy involves using portable whole body irradiation units to treat patients at home. This requires careful patient training and remote monitoring by expert phototherapy nurses. A randomized controlled study comparing home with hospital-based phototherapy for psoriasis (Koek M, BuskensE, Van Weelden H et al. Home versus outpatient ultraviolet B phototherapy for mild to severe psoriasis: pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled non inferiority trial (PLUTO). BMJ 2009; 338: 1542) has shown this to be a safe, effective and cost-effective method of treatment delivery. The uptake of home phototherapy has been very poor within the NHS with the exception of Ninewells Hospital who has a well-established service. We describe our early experience setting up a NB-UVB home phototherapy service. Our department acquired five whole body TL01 UVB home units (Waldmann UV100L). Treatment documentation, protocols, patient information and supporting literature were approved by our risk management department. Patients referred for phototherapy were offered this treatment option if circumstances prevented regular attendance to hospital. A phototherapy nurse practitioner carries out a consultation, which includes training in operation of the unit, treatment protocols and self-assessment of erythema and has regular phone contact with the patient. The initial starting dose was determined following minimum erythema dose testing and patients used the department's standard NB-UVB protocol. We treated nine patients in 2017 (3 women and 6 men with a median age of 53, range 37-75). Seven had psoriasis, one vitiligo and one polymorphic light eruption and psoriasis. All the psoriasis patients cleared with 30 exposures or less. Rates of E2 erythema were 1.3\% of all exposures delivered and no patient recorded any episodes of E3 or E4. All patients expressed very high levels of satisfaction and would choose home phototherapy again if available. Ninewells hospital in Dundee have offered an NHS home phototherapy service since 1998 (Cameron H, Yule S, Dawe RS et al. Review of an established U.K. home phototherapy service 1998-2011: improving access to a cost effective treatment since for chronic skin disease. Public Health 2014; 128: 317-24) but to our knowledge, no other NHS unit in England provides this service. Our experience of home phototherapy has been very successful with safe and effective outcomes as well as high levels of patient satisfaction. We have now expanded the service with five more units and our experience will hopefully encourage other departments to develop this service.},

Methods: A 3 month randomized controlled trial was performed to compare a TM-based strategy (G1) with conventional hospital management (G2). Subjects with OSA suspicion and with internet skills were enrolled (n, 186). G1 included 3 home respiratory polygraphies (HRP) for diagnosis as well as videoconferences for remote interaction with patients. If CPAP was needed, an automatic device with daily data transmission was used. G2 included full management at the hospital. Depending on physician criteria, PSG or HRP was used for diagnosis or titration and fixed CPAP was used for treatment. Results: G1: 94 patients were included (Age 50.3±11.3yr, BMI 29.9±6.1kg/m2); 83\% had OSA diagnosis and 34\% with CPAP treatment. G2: 92 patients were included (Age 50.8±12.1yr, BMI 31.5±10.9kg/m2); 77\% with OSA diagnosis and 44\% with CPAP treatment. At the end of the study no differences were found in the Epworth Scale (G1 9.9±4.3 vs G2 8.5±4.4). In patients requiring CPAP; compliance was 5.7±1.4 and 5.6± 1.6 h/night respectively; p{\textgreater}0.05). Side effects and degree of satisfaction were similar in both groups.

	abstract = {Introduction \& Objective: Surgical telementoring by videoconferencing was first described in the sixties. There is renewed interest in telemedicine solutions in surgical training with evidence that telementoring is cost-effective and safe, leading to the launch of a national US research initiative. Nonetheless, there is still insufficient data on educational outcomes. Recently, a telemedical device (Omnistrator®, Omnitivity Inc, Boston, USA) has allowed surgeons to bi-directionally annotate over a delay free video stream and communicate with audio. Our aim was to assess telementoring techniques for training surgeons performing Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumour (TURBT). Methods: A trainee surgeon was given instructions on the steps of surgery and randomly assigned either traditional (verbal), or telementoring supervision (verbal + visual annotation). Inclusion criteria: elective cases for primary or follow up single TURBT with a size of up to 3cms; and exclusion criteria: nonelective/ emergency cases, multiple tumours, or tumour over 3 cms. The TURBT procedure was performed in a modular/stepwise manner to allow comparison of outcomes. Set up: A tablet device (Mentor controlled) was wirelessly and securely connected to the secondary operating screen Omnistrator ®. Bidirectional audio, video and annotation was then available for mentor and trainee. Outcome measure: we compared surgical performance of a trainee surgeon, with and without telementoring. Study size: we evaluated 10 traditionally supervised and 10 telementored TURBT as a pilot study. Results: Telestration during TURBT statistically improved (see table) the superficial (p {\textless} 0.001) and deep bladder (p {\textless} 0.001) resection; bladder biopsy (p {\textless} 0.04); knowledge of anatomy (p {\textless} 0.0002); and overall precision of the procedure (p {\textless} 0.0001). There was no difference in complications or safety. Trainees reported a preference for telestration, as the surgical area of interest on the operating screen was highlighted by annotation, allowing time to assess and plan the next surgical step. The supervising surgeon did not need to physically operate in any telestrated case (n = 10); but did so in traditional cases (n = 4). Conclusions: Our initial experience shows telestration using an Omnistrator is safe and effective for improving training of TURBT and was well received by our trainees. (Figure Presented).},

	abstract = {Objectives: To determine the awareness and willingness-to-pay for smart healthcare among the general population of Korea Methods: A survey was conducted during December of 2017 using data obtained via an Internet-based survey from 500 randomized people between 20-59 years old. To make a generalized selection, it was conducted across the nation on a pro-rata basis covering seven regions. The survey instrument included questions regarding demographics, preferences, importance and affordability Results: About smart healthcare awareness, 78.2\% of respondents replied that they had heard about smart healthcare but only 14\% were well-informed about it. The main channels of exposure to information were from internet news articles, TV news and health information programs 74\% of respondents replied that they would like to use smart healthcare services, 22\% were neutral, and 5\% replied that they did not intend to use a service. Regarding a willingness to pay, 51\% of respondents replied that they were not willing to pay more than 10,000KRW per month while 28\% replied that 10,000{\textasciitilde}30,000KRW was acceptable, 13\% replied that they were willing to pay 50,000{\textasciitilde}100,000KRW, and 2\% replied that 100,000KRW was tolerable One-way remote-monitoring is allowed under medical law in Korea but only 20\% were aware of this, while 80\% of respondents were misinformed This survey has a 95\% confidence level with a ±4.4\% sampling error Conclusions: As a result of the population aging and an increase of healthcare expenditure, interest in cost-effective healthcare services has been rising while the healthcare service paradigm has been gradually shifting from treatment to prediction, prevention and personalized medicine. Aligned with this trend, smart healthcare services will play an important role for effective disease management and improved quality of life. We could find that to make that happen, providing the right information to the general population and developing prescient political system are very important},

	abstract = {Objectives/Introduction: Untreated Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) can lead to high morbidity, such as reduced cognitive function and increased risk of accidents, and it is associated with diseases such as systemic arterial hypertension, metabolic syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. Multimorbidity implies to change organization of care and follow-up. We prospectively assessed adherence using daily telemonitoring of naïve Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) OSA patients' data and other associated clinical parameters of cardio-metabolic risk during one year. The ultimate goal of this pilot trial will be to develop an effective, extensible and costeffective system to promote improved adherence to CPAP patients, as well as monitor clinical parameters (HR, hypertension, glycaemia, and oximetry) of frequently associated OSA co-morbidities. Methods: In a single center, 80 naïve PAP adult patients with moderate to severe OSA were randomized in two groups: standard care consisting in first week, first, third and sixth month consultations and those with daily telemonitoring information (i.e., adherence, air leak, residual AHI) plus standard care. Subjects who used PAP for at least 5 h per night for at least 90\% of the days monitored were regarded as adherent. We also analyzed the correlation between adherence and cardio-metabolic clinical parameters. Results: 73 patients were enrolled, 35 were randomized to telemedicine and 38 to standard care. The mean age was 57.2 year, mean AHI was 38,4 events/hr, and 59\% of patients were male. After 1 month, mean PAP adherence was significantly greater in the telemedicine arm versus the standard arm. But after 6 months mean PAP adherence was almost total sleep time in both arms (6h34 vs 5h58). Conclusions: PAP adherence can be motivated and faster with the use of a web-based telemedicine system at the beginning of the treatment. This trial demonstrates that sustained long-term PAP adherence occurs during the first few days. Telemedicine monitoring of naïve PAP OSA patients can be cost-effective by reducing the need of consultations. Also cardio-metabolic clinical parameters significantly improved with total sleep time PAP adherence associated with body mass control and exercise.},

Little is known about patterns of healthcare utilization (HCU) of patients following utilization of telemedical care (TMC). Our aim was to examine HCU of patients with breast cancer one year before and after first utilization of TMC. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted among Maccabi Healthcare Services enrollees that were newly diagnosed with breast cancer during January-September 2016 and used TMC (n=96). Control subjects who did not use TMC were randomly selected and matched by age, district, disease duration and eligibility to social benefit due to low income, disability or age (n=187). HCU data as well as demographic characteristics and comorbidity burden were obtained from computerized databases. Results: Mean±SD age of the study population was 55.9±10.5 years. No significant differences were found between the study and control groups in prevalence of heart disease (P=0.916), diabetes (P=0.551), hypertension (P=0.969), socioeconomic status (P=0.759), and insurance coverage (P=0.834). Before exposure to TMC (baseline), the average total annual HCU costs of the study group was higher than that of the control group (\$8268 vs. \$7007, P=0.006), however, a more economically significant difference was found in the year following exposure to TMC (\$45251 vs. \$23572, P{\textless}0.001). Most of the difference stems from 1.73 times higher outpatient visits costs (p{\textless}0.001), 3.24 times higher medication costs (P{\textless}0.001), and 1.65 times higher hospitalization costs (P=0.044). No significant difference in surgeries costs was found between groups following exposure to TMC (P=0.285). Conclusions: Exposure to TMC increased annual HCU costs one year following it. This may reflect a timelier, thus effective management of the disease. Further research on long-term HCU and health outcomes of patients with breast cancer following exposure to TMC will enable to examine the cost-effectiveness of this technology.},

Is especially prevalent in conditions where symptoms may fluctuate or may be hidden like Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Untreated OSA lead to high morbidity, such as reduced cognitive function, depression, infertility, increased risk of accidents, and it is associated with diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Chronic multimorbidity is a new challenge and must involve a change in the global organization of care and follow-up. We prospectively assessed adherence using daily telemonitoring of naïve Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) OSA patients' data and associated clinical parameters of cardio-metabolic risk during one year. The ultimate goal of this trial will be to develop an effective, extensible and cost-effective system to promote improved adherence to CPAP patients.

PAP adherence in the telemedicine arm was almost total sleep time (7h34) versus 3h47 in the standard arm. Conclusions: PAP adherence should be improved with the use of a web-based telemedicine system at the beginning of the treatment. This trial demonstrates that good PAP adherence occurs during the first few days and can be predicted in first two consultations. Cardio- metabolic clinical parameters significantly improved with total sleep time PAP adherence associated with body mass control and exercise.},

Participants (N = 61) had chronic back pain (pain “daily” ≥6 months at an intensity of ≥4 of 10 scale) and were randomized to an 8-week, 12-session, CBT or to supportive care (SC) matched for frequency, format, and time, with each treatment delivered by a primary care nurse. The primary outcome was the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). Secondary outcomes included the numeric rating scale (NRS) and the Patient Global Impressions Scale (CGI). CBT participants (n = 30) showed significant improvements on the RMDQ (mean = 11.4 [SD = 5.9] vs 9.4 [SD = 6.1] at baseline and post-treatment, respectively, P {\textless}.05; d =.33), NRS (mean = 4.9 [SD = 2.1] vs 4.0 [SD = 1.9], respectively, P {\textless}.05; d =.45), and on the CGI (39.1\% reporting “much improved” or “very much improved”). SC participants (n = 31) also showed significant improvements on the RMDQ (mean = 11.1 [SD = 5.4] vs 9.1 [SD = 5.2], respectively, P {\textless}.05; d =.38), the NRS, (mean = 5.0 [SD = 1.9] vs 3.8 [SD = 2.1], respectively, P {\textless}.05; d =.60), and 26.7\% reporting “much improved” or “very much improved” on the CGI. Between groups comparisons of CBT and SC showed no differences on the study outcomes (Ps {\textgreater}.10). The results suggest that telehealth, nurse-delivered CBT, and SC treatments for chronic back pain can offer significant and relatively comparable benefits. Perspective: This article describes the benefits of training primary care nurses to deliver evidence-based behavioral therapies for low back pain. Because of the high prevalence of chronic pain and the growing emphasis on nonopioid therapies, training nurses to provide behavior therapies could be a cost-effective way to improve pain management.},

Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of home monitoring of lung mechanics by the forced oscillation technique and cardiac parameter in older patients with COPD and comorbidities. Methods: This multicenter, randomized clinical trial recruited 312 patients with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease grades II to IV COPD (median age, 71 yr [interquartile range 66–76 yr]; 49.6\% grade II, 50.4\% grades III–IV), with a history of exacerbation in the previous year and at least one nonpulmonary comorbidity. Patients were randomized to usual care (n = 158) or telemonitoring (n = 154) and followed for 9 months. All telemonitoring patients self-assessed lung mechanics daily, and in a subgroup with congestive heart failure (n = 37) cardiac parameters were also monitored. An algorithm identified deterioration, triggering a telephone contact to determine appropriate interventions. Measurements and Main Results: Primary outcomes were time to first hospitalization (TTFH) and change in the EuroQoL EQ-5D utility index score. Secondary outcomes included: rate of antibiotic/corticosteroid prescription; hospitalization; the COPD Assessment Tool, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire scores; quality-adjusted life years; and healthcare costs. Telemonitoring did not affect TTFH, EQ-5D utility index score, antibiotic prescriptions, hospitalization rate, or questionnaire scores. In an exploratory analysis, telemedicine was associated with fewer repeat hospitalizations (254\%; P = 0.017).

Methods: This was a randomized, noninferiority trial, with participants assigned to 1 of 2 arms of 8-week behavioral activation therapy: in-person or via telehealth. Primary clinical outcomes included measures of depression (Geriatric Depression Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) at 12 months follow-up. Quality of life was assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Economic outcomes included the difference in health services utilization costs between 1 year post-intervention and 1 year pre-intervention, as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for differences in cost based on mean travel and median travel relative to the 3 primary outcomes and QALYs. Results: 241 participants were enrolled and completed study procedures between April 2007 and July 2012. Post-intervention, veterans treated inperson had a mean of \$2,998 higher VA health care utilization costs relative to their pre-intervention utilization costs, while veterans treated via telehealth had a mean of \$870.91 higher costs post-intervention relative to preintervention. The difference between bootstrap mean and median QALYs was not significantly different from zero. Conclusions: Although the intervention costs for telehealth were higher relative to in-person care, veterans receiving behavioral activation via telehealth had lower health utilization costs 1 year after the intervention than those receiving care in person while QALYs were approximately the same. These results demonstrate the noninferiority of telehealth in treating depression in veterans with respect to QALYs and a large and significant cost benefit of using telehealth in terms of health services utilization post-intervention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemonitoring of symptoms and physiological signs has been suggested as a means of early detection of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, with a view to instituting timely treatment. However, algorithms to identify exacerbations result in frequent false-positive results and increased workload. Machine learning, when applied to predictive modelling, can determine patterns of risk factors useful for improving prediction quality. OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to (1) establish whether machine learning techniques applied to telemonitoring datasets improve prediction of hospital admissions and decisions to start corticosteroids, and (2) determine whether the addition of weather data further improves such predictions. METHODS: We used daily symptoms, physiological measures, and medication data, with baseline demography, COPD severity, quality of life, and hospital admissions from a pilot and large randomized controlled trial of telemonitoring in COPD. We linked weather data from the United Kingdom meteorological service. We used feature selection and extraction techniques for time series to construct up to 153 predictive patterns (features) from symptom, medication, and physiological measurements. We used the resulting variables to construct predictive models fitted to training sets of patients and compared them with common symptom-counting algorithms. RESULTS: We had a mean 363 days of telemonitoring data from 135 patients. The two most practical traditional score-counting algorithms, restricted to cases with complete data, resulted in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) estimates of 0.60 (95\% CI 0.51-0.69) and 0.58 (95\% CI 0.50-0.67) for predicting admissions based on a single day's readings. However, in a real-world scenario allowing for missing data, with greater numbers of patient daily data and hospitalizations (N=57,150, N+=55, respectively), the performance of all the traditional algorithms fell, including those based on 2 days' data. One of the most frequently used algorithms performed no better than chance. All considered machine learning models demonstrated significant improvements; the best machine learning algorithm based on 57,150 episodes resulted in an aggregated AUC of 0.74 (95\% CI 0.67-0.80). Adding weather data measurements did not improve the predictive performance of the best model (AUC 0.74, 95\% CI 0.69-0.79). To achieve an 80\% true-positive rate (sensitivity), the traditional algorithms were associated with an 80\% false-positive rate: our algorithm halved this rate to approximately 40\% (specificity approximately 60\%). The machine learning algorithm was moderately superior to the best symptom-counting algorithm (AUC 0.77, 95\% CI 0.74-0.79 vs AUC 0.66, 95\% CI 0.63-0.68) at predicting the need for corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection and management of COPD remains an important goal given its huge personal and economic costs. Machine learning approaches, which can be tailored to an individual's baseline profile and can learn from experience of the individual patient, are superior to existing predictive algorithms and show promise in achieving this goal.

	abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study is to develop, implement, and evaluate a model for the remote, long-term observation of Parkinson's disease (PD) clinical trial cohorts using smartphone-based assessments, web-based surveys, and virtual research visits (tele-visits). Background: STEADY-PD3 and SURE-PD3 are active NINDS-funded phase 3 interventional studies of potential disease-modifying therapeutics for PD. Long-term follow-up of these clinical trial cohorts may enable the detection of a persistent or delayed disease-modifying effect. However, long-term observation of these cohorts would be cost-prohibitive with the traditional research model. Independent of the interventional studies' outcomes, the use of novel technologies that enable frequent collection of patient-reported outcomes and objective assessment in a realistic setting could be used to develop digital biomarkers of disease progression and pilot a new research model. Preliminary work has demonstrated that tele-visits are feasible, acceptable to participants, and sufficient for the collection of clinician-reported outcomes and that smartphone-based applications can be used to quantify PD motor severity. We will now 1) establish and implement the infrastructure for a new remote research model 2) compare smartphone outcomes against tele-visit outcomes and 3) explore smartphone-based biomarkers of PD disability and progression. Methods: An estimated 420 individuals completing STEADY-PD3 or SURE-PD3 will be consented and enrolled into a remote observational study (AT-HOME PD) and followed for 24 months using three platforms: tele-visits, smartphone-based assessments, and web-based surveys. Centralized movement disorders specialists will conduct annual tele-visits, which will include the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment. On a quarterly basis, participants will complete two-week sessions of smartphone-based assessments, including motor tasks, cognitive assessments, and patient-reported outcomes. For consented participants, the smartphone application will collect GPS and accelerometer based movement and activity data. Participants will be asked to enroll in a companion online clinical research study, Fox Insight, and to complete web-based surveys on a quarterly basis. Data from the three platforms will be integrated with data from the parent studies and the complete dataset will be transferred to the Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program's Data Management Resource for use by the broader research community. Conclusions: AT-HOME PD, which will launch in the summer of 2018, will use novel tele-health metrics to enable the remote, long-term follow-up of PD clinical trial cohorts and develop digital biomarkers of disease progression.},

	abstract = {Introduction This study examined the effect of a telehealth intervention on the control of type 2 diabetes and subsequent potential cost-savings to the health system. Methods This prospective randomised controlled trial randomised adults with type 2 diabetes to the intervention (diabetes program) or control (usual care) arm. Key eligibility criteria included an HbA1c level of at least 58 mmol/mol (7.5\%) without severe or unstable comorbidities. All participants continued their usual healthcare, but participants in the intervention arm received additional diabetes care from a diabetes care coordinator via a home monitor that captured clinical measures. Data collected included biomedical, quality of life measures and healthcare (GP, outpatient and inpatient) costs. The primary outcome was HbA1c collected at baseline and 6 months. Analysis was conducted on a complete case intention-to-treat basis. The healthcare system perspective was taken to calculate the incremental cost per percentage-point reduction in HbA1c. Results Results from 63 participants from each study arm were analysed. HbA1c in the intervention group decreased from a median 68 mmol/mol (8.4\%) to 58 mmol/mol (7.5\%), and remained unchanged in the control group at median 65 mmol/mol (8.1\%) at the 6-month endpoint. The intervention effect on HbA1c change was statistically significant ( p = .004). Total healthcare costs in the intervention group, including the intervention costs, were lower (mean \$3781 vs. \$4662; p {\textless} .001) compared with usual care. Discussion There was a clinically meaningful and statistically significant benefit from the telehealth intervention at a lower cost; thus, telehealth was cost-saving and produced greater health benefits compared with usual care.},

	abstract = {Background: Pharmacist-managed (team-based) care for hypertension with home blood pressure monitoring support interventions has been widely studied and shown to be effective in improving rates of hypertension control and lowering blood pressure; however, few studies have evaluated the economic considerations related to bringing these programs into usual practice. Objective: To analyze the economic outcomes of the Home Blood Pressure Telemonitoring and Case Management to Control Hypertension (Hyperlink) study, a cluster randomized controlled trial which used home blood pressure telemonitoring and pharmacist case management to achieve better blood pressure control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension was conducted. Methods: A prospective analysis compared differences in medical costs and encounters in the Hyperlink telemonitoring intervention and usual care groups in the 12 months pre- and postenrollment using medical and pharmacy insurance claims from a health care sector perspective. Generalized estimating equation models were used to estimate differences between the groups over time. These results, combined with previously published prospective study results on intervention costs and blood pressure outcomes, were used to estimate cost-effectiveness measures for blood pressure control and reduction. Findings: Total medical costs in the intervention group were lower compared with the usual care group by an average of \$281 per person, but this difference was not statistically significant. Clinic-based office visit, radiology, pharmacy and hospital costs were also nonsignificantly lower in the intervention group. Statistically significant differences were found in lipid-related laboratory costs (higher) and in hypertension-related (higher) and lipid-related (lower) pharmacy costs. Patterns in medical costs were similar for medical encounters. On average, the intervention cost \$7337 per person achieving hypertension control and \$139 or \$265 per mm Hg reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure, respectively. Conclusions: Home blood pressure monitoring and pharmacist case management to improve hypertension care can be implemented without increasing, and potentially reducing, overall medical care costs.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Value-based care is a promising strategy to improve quality of care and control costs, but warrants systematic measurement of patient-reported outcomes. Telemedicine is a powerful tool to enable continuous monitoring of outcomes in chronic diseases. For inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), implementation of telemedicine previously showed to reduce outpatient visits and hospital admissions (1). However, cost-utility analyses are lacking. We therefore evaluated the incremental cost-utility of telemedicine versus standard care for IBD patients. Aims and Methods: We used data from the 12-month myIBDcoach trial in which 909 IBD patients were randomized to telemedicine (n=465) or standard care (n=444). Direct healthcare costs were estimated based on resource use multiplied by the appropriate unit prices, indirect or productivity costs were calculated using the friction-cost method, a license fee of €40 was calculated for patients using telemedicine, and utilities were assessed using EQ5D (Dutch tariff). Costutility and uncertainty were estimated using the non-parametric bootstrapping method. Results: Telemedicine resulted in a mean yearly cost saving of -€554 per patient (95\%CI, [€-987, €2,094]; mean costs of €9495 for standard care and €8941 for telemedicine) and was associated with a small mean gain in quality adjusted life years (QALY) of 0.002 (95\%CI, [-0.022, 0.018]). As myIBDcoach results on average in lower costs and somewhat better health, overall this innovative intervention dominates usual care. Telemedicine was cost-reducing in 76\% of the replications. However, there is still uncertainty, as dominance occurs only in 57\% of the replications (figure 1). Conclusion: Telemedicine with myIBDcoach is on average cost-reducing compared to standard care with maintained quality of life. However, there is large uncertainty and it might be of interest to detect whether a subgroup can be identified in which use of myIBDcoach results in higher QALY without higher costs. Trials with longer follow-up are required to determine whether telemedicine can improve quality of life and disease outcomes on the long term.},

We assessed 3 low-cost telemedicine solutions capable of supporting remote US training to determine feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. We also explored the value of instructional videos immediately before telementoring. METHODS: Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned to receive US mentoring in 1 of 3 telemedicine conditions: multiple fixed cameras, a smartphone, and traditional audio with a live US stream. Participants were then asked to perform a standardized US examination of the right upper quadrant under remote guidance. We measured observer's global ratings of performance along with the mentor's and student's rating of effort and satisfaction to determine which of the 3 approaches was most feasible, acceptable, and effective. During the second phase, students were randomized to watch an instructional video or not before receiving remote coaching on how to complete a subxiphoid cardiac examination. Effort, satisfaction, and performance from the independent observer's and student's perspective were surveyed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the different telemedicine setups from the observer's perspective; however, the mentor rated the smartphone significantly worse (P = .028-.04) than other technologies. Platforms were rated equivalent from the student's perspective. No benefit was detected for watching an instructional video before the mentored task. CONCLUSIONS: Remote US skills can be taught equally effectively by using a variety of telemedicine technologies. Smartphones represent a viable option for US training in resource-challenged settings.},

Severe COPD patients in stable condition were randomized to a specific monitoring protocol with TH or routine clinical practice (RCP). The primary objective was to reduce the number of COPD exacerbations leading to ER visits/hospital admissions between groups. Results: Overall, 237 COPD patients were screened, and 229 (96.6\%) were randomized to TH (n = 115) or RCP (n = 114), with age of 71 ± 8 years and 80\% were men. Overall, 169 completed the full follow-up period. There were no statistical differences at one year between groups in the proportion of participants who had a COPD exacerbation (60\% in TH vs. 53.5\% in RCP; p = 0.321). There was, however, a marked but non-significant trend towards a shorter duration of hospitalization and days in ICU in the TH group (18.9 ± 16.0 and 6.0 ± 4.6 days) compared to the RCP group (22.4 ± 19.5 and 13.3 ± 11.1 days). The number of all-cause deaths was comparable between groups (12 in TH vs. 13 in RCP) as was total resource utilization cost (7912€ in TH vs. 8918€ in RCP). Telehealth was evaluated highly positively by patients and doctors. Conclusions: Remote patient management did not reduce COPD-related ER visits or hospital admissions compared to RCP within 12 months.},

More than 2 million people in Kuwait own mobile phones. We will test whether automated personalised health text messages based on principles of motivational interviewing and are responsive to biodata delivered remotely is potentially effective in improving glycaemic control compared to usual care. METHODS: This is a two-arm parallel single-blind randomised controlled trial of 572 individuals with type 2 diabetes in Kuwait. We will develop a culturally appropriate database of text messages supporting positive lifestyle changes in type 2 diabetes. A computer programme will deliver over 400 text messages over a 12-month period using algorithms which provide participants with information on diet and physical activity as well as personalised messages regarding motivators to change behaviours. Individuals aged 18-75 years with established type 2 diabetes who are fluent in Arabic or English and officially resident in Kuwait will be identified via screening of hospital diabetes clinic and primary care practices and invited to participate. A sample of 572 participants will be randomised to usual care or usual care plus the DATES text message intervention. Randomisation will be conducted by an independent Clinical Trials Unit and researchers collecting baseline and outcome data will be blinded to treatment allocation. The primary outcome is change in HbA1c and weight at 12 months in both study arms. Secondary outcomes will include changes in physical activity, fasting lipids and quality of life in both study arms. DISCUSSION: The potential of mobile phones in improving diabetes self-care in settings with a high prevalence of diabetes and widespread mobile phone usage has face validity. Mobile phones and text messaging are an understudied virtual communication media which can deliver discrete focused psychological support to motivate and enable diabetes self-care changes.

METHOD: A pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted among 63 underactive adults in Birmingham, Alabama, from 2015 to 2017. RESULTS: Retention was 88.9\% at 12 weeks, and ≥75\% adherence (IVR contact on at least 63 out of 84 days) was noted among 62.5\% of intervention participants. Intervention participants reported larger increases in self-reported minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity from baseline to 12 weeks than the wait-list control arm (median change = 47.5 vs. 5.0 minutes, respectively, p = .09). Moreover, the intervention produced significantly greater increases in physical activity self-regulation ( p {\textless} .001) and social support from family ( p = .001) and friends ( p = .009) from baseline to 12 weeks, compared with the wait-list control. Significant decreases in self-reported sleep disturbance also were found in the intervention arm but not among the controls, p {\textless} .05. Overall, intervention participants reported being satisfied with the DIAL program (71.4\%) and would recommend it to friends (92.9\%).

	abstract = {RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated the feasibility and suitability of the proposed system for pain management. Its handling was user-friendly, without requiring advanced skill or prior experience. In addition, the results showed that the guidance of health care professionals is essential to patients' satisfaction and positive experience with the system. There were no significant group differences with respect to improvements in the quality of pain treatment; however, this can be explained by the low pain scores registered in both groups, related to the type of surgical interventions recruited and the degrees of pain that are easily treated. To evaluate the benefits from a patient-centred perspective, studies of major ambulatory surgeries or of patients in chronic pain, including oncologic and non-oncologic pain resistant to treatment, are necessary.
BACKGROUND: For economic reasons, i.e., to reduce costs of in-hospital patient accommodations, constant pressure has been applied in recent years to increase the percentage of ambulatory surgeries. Effective control of post-operative pain after ambulatory surgery is challenging to all health professionals. Computerised systems are being implemented more frequently for remote patient monitoring, including during the at-home post-operative period.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the feasibility of delivering a computerised system, developed in-house, for remote pain monitoring. It evaluates the user-friendliness of the system and the extent of patient compliance. Finally, a comparative assessment of the system is made with respect to the quality of pain treatment in ambulatory surgery.
METHODS: The participants included 32 adults, aged 18-75, randomly assigned to a control group or to a computerised treatment group. The primary treatment outcome was measured by pain intensity ratings (0-10 NRS) reported several times per day during a five-day monitoring period, using an electronic pain diary combined with a web-based personal health record.},

	abstract = {STUDY QUESTION Does self-operated endovaginal telemonitoring (SOET) of the ovarian stimulation phase in IVF/ICSI produce similar laboratory, clinical, patient reported and health-economic results as traditional monitoring (non-SOET)? SUMMARY ANSWER SOET is not inferior to traditional monitoring (non-SOET). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Monitoring the follicular phase is needed to adapt gonadotrophin dose, detect threatening hyperstimulation and plan HCG administration. Currently, patients pay visits to care providers, entailing transportation costs and productivity loss. It stresses patients, partners, care providers and the environment. Patients living at great distance from centres have more difficult access to treatment. The logistics and stress during the follicular phase of assisted reproduction treatment (ART) is often an impediment for treatment. STUDY DESIGNS, SIZE, DURATION The study was a non-inferiority RCT between SOET and non-SOET performed between February 2012 and October 2013. Sample size calculations of number of metaphase II (MII) oocytes (the primary outcome): 81 patients were needed in each study arm for sufficient statistical power. Block randomization was used with allocation concealment through electronic files. The first sonogram was requested after 5 days of stimulation, after that mostly every 2 days and with a daily sonograms at the end. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS Inclusion criteria were age {\textless}41 years, undergoing ICSI, no poor response and having two ovaries. We used a small laptop with USB connected vaginal probe and developed a specific web site application. Sonographic training was given to all women at the initiation of a treatment attempt at the centre. The website contained demonstration material consisting of still images and video sequences, as well as written instructions regarding the use of the instrument and probe handling. In total, 185 eligible patients were recruited in four centres: 123 were randomized; 121 completed SOET (n = 59) or non-SOET (n = 62), and 62/185 (33\%) eligible patients declined participation for various reasons. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Patient characteristics were comparable. The clinical results showed similar conception rates (P = 0.47) and ongoing pregnancy rates (SOET: 15/59 = 25\%; non-SOET: 16/62 = 26\%) (P = 1.00) were obtained. Similar numbers of follicles {\textgreater}15 mm diameter at oocyte retrieval (OR), ova at OR, MII oocytes, log2 MII oocytes, embryos available at transfer, top quality embryos and embryos frozen were obtained in the two groups, indicating non-inferiority of SOET monitoring. Regarding patient-reported outcomes, a significantly higher contentedness of patient and partner (P {\textless} 0.01), a higher feeling of empowerment, discretion and more active partner participation (P {\textless} 0.001) as well as a trend towards less stress (P = 0.06) were observed in the S versus the NS group. In the economic analysis, the use of SOET led to reduced productivity loss, lower transportation costs, and lower sonogram and consultation costs (all P {\textless} 0.001 but higher personnel cost than NS). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The study was stopped (no further funding) before full sample size was reached. There were also a few cases of unexpected poor response, leading to a wider SD than anticipated in the power calculation. However, although the study was underpowered for these reasons, non-inferiority of SOET versus non-SOET was demonstrated. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Home monitoring using SOET may provide a patient-centred alternative to the standard methods. ART sonograms can be made, and then sent to the care provider for analysis at any appropriate time and from anywhere if an internet connection is available. This approach offers several advantages for patients as well as care providers, including similar results to the traditional methods with less logistical stress and potentially bringing care to patients in poor resource settings.

	abstract = {Aims: Self-monitoring and self-titration of antihypertensives (self-management) is a novel intervention which improves blood pressure control. However, little evidence exists regarding the cost-effectiveness of self-monitoring of blood pressure in general and self-management in particular. This study aimed to evaluate whether self-management of hypertension was cost-effective.
Design and methods: A cohort Markov model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken extrapolating to up to 35 years from cost and outcome data collected from the telemonitoring and self-management in hypertension trial (TASMINH2). Self-management of hypertension was compared with usual care in terms of lifetime costs, quality adjusted life years and cost-effectiveness using a UK Health Service perspective. Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of different time horizons and reduced effectiveness over time from self-management.
Results: In the long-term, when compared with usual care, self-management was more effective by 0.24 and 0.12 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient for men and women, respectively. The resultant incremental costeffectiveness ratio for self-management was 1624 per QALY for men and 4923 per QALY for women. There was at least a 99\% chance of the intervention being cost-effective for both sexes at a willingness to pay threshold of 20,000 per QALY gained. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses around the assumptions made, provided that the effects of self-management lasted at least two years for men and five years for women.
Conclusion: Self-monitoring with self-titration of antihypertensives and telemonitoring of blood pressure measurements not only reduces blood pressure, compared with usual care, but also represents a cost-effective use of health care resources.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite their high rates of depression, homebound older adults have limited access to evidence-based psychotherapy. The purpose of this paper was to report both depression and disability outcomes of telehealth problem-solving therapy (tele-PST via Skype video call) for low-income homebound older adults over 6 months postintervention. Methods: A 3-arm randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of tele-PST to in-person PST and telephone care calls with 158 homebound individuals who were aged 50+ and scored 15+ on the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). Treatment effects on depression severity (HAMD score) and disability (score on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule [WHODAS]) were analyzed using mixed-effects regression with random intercept models. Possible reciprocal relationships between depression and disability were examined with a parallel-process latent growth curve model. Results: Both tele-PST and in-person PST were efficacious treatments for low-income homebound older adults; however the effects of tele-PST on both depression and disability outcomes were sustained significantly longer than those of in-person PST. Effect sizes (dGMA-raw) for HAMD score changes at 36 weeks were 0.68 for tele-PST and 0.20 for in-person PST. Effect sizes for WHODAS score changes at 36 weeks were 0.47 for tele-PST and 0.25 for in-person PST. The results also supported reciprocal and indirect effects between depression and disability outcomes. Conclusions: The efficacy and potential low cost of tele-delivered psychotherapy show its potential for easy replication and sustainability to reach a large number of underserved older adults and improve their access to mental health services. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Remote patientmonitoring is a safe and effective alternative for the in-clinic follow-up of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). However, evidence on the patient perspective on remote monitoring is scarce and inconsistent.
Objectives: The primary objective of the REMOTE-CIED study is to evaluate the influence of remote patient monitoring versus in-clinic follow-up on patient-reported outcomes. Secondary objectives are to: 1) identify subgroups of patients who may not be satisfied with remote monitoring; and 2) investigate the cost-effectiveness of remote monitoring.
Methods: The REMOTE-CIED study is an international randomised controlled study that will include 900 consecutive heart failure patients implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) compatible with the Boston Scientific LATITUDE® Remote Patient Management system at participating centres in five European countries. Patients will be randomised to remote monitoring or in-clinic followup. The In-Clinic group will visit the outpatient clinic every 3– 6 months, according to standard practice. The Remote Monitoring group only visits the outpatient clinic at 12 and 24 months post-implantation, other check-ups are performed remotely. Patients are asked to complete questionnaires at five time points during the 2-year follow-up.
Conclusion: The REMOTE-CIED study will provide insight into the patient perspective on remote monitoring in ICD patients, which could help to support patient-centred care in the future.},

Methods REM-HF is a multicentre, randomized, non-blinded, parallel trial designed to compare weekly remote monitoring-driven management with usual care for patients with cardiac implanted electronic devices (ICD, CRT-D, or CRT-P). The trial is event driven, and the final analysis will be performed when 546 events have been observed or the study is terminated at the interim analysis. We have randomized 1650 patients to be followed up for a minimum of 2 years. Patients will remain in the trial up to study termination. The first patient was randomized in September 2011 and the study is expected to complete in early 2016. The primary combined endpoint is time to first event of all-cause death or unplanned hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. An economic evaluation will be performed, estimating the cost per quality-adjusted lifeyear, with direct costs estimated from the National Health Service perspective and quality of life assessed by the EQ-5D, Short-Form12, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaires. The study design has been informed by a feasibility study.
Conclusion REM-HF is a multicentre randomized study that will provide important data on the effect of remote monitoring-driven management of implanted cardiac devices on morbidity and mortality, as well as the cost-effectiveness of this approach. Trial registration: UKCRN 10383.},

	abstract = {Background Telemonitoring has been advocated as a way of decreasing costs and improving outcomes, but no study has looked at true Medicare payments and 30-day readmission rates in a randomized group of well treated patients. Objective The aim of this work was to analyze Medicare claims data to identify effects of home telemonitoring on medical costs, 30-day rehospitalization, mortality, and health-related quality of life. Methods A total of 204 subjects were randomized to usual-care and monitored groups and evaluated with the SF-36 and Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHF). Hospitalizations, Medicare payments, and mortality were also assessed. Monitored subjects transmitted weight, blood pressure, and heart rate, which were monitored by an experienced heart failure nurse practitioner. Results Subjects were followed for 802 ± 430 days; 75 subjects in the usual-care group (316 hospitalizations) and 81 in the monitored group (327 hospitalizations) were hospitalized at least once (P =.51). There were no differences in Medicare payments for inpatient or emergency department visits, and length of stay was not different between groups. There was no difference in 30-day readmissions (P =.627) or mortality (P =.575). Scores for SF-36 and MLHF improved (P {\textless}.001) over time, but there were no differences between groups. The percentage of patients readmitted within 30 days was lower with telemonitoring for the 1st year, but this did not persist. Conclusions Telemonitoring did not result in lower total costs, decreased hospitalizations, improved symptoms, or improved mortality. A decrease in 30-day readmission rates for the 1st year did not result in decreased total cost or better outcomes. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aims The Effectiveness and Cost of ICD follow-up Schedule with Telecardiology (ECOST) trial evaluated prospectively the economic impact of long-term remote monitoring (RM) of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Methods and results The analysis included 310 patients randomly assigned to RM (active group) vs. ambulatory follow-ups (control group). Patients in the active group were seen once a year unless the system reported an event mandating an ambulatory visit, while patients in the control group were seen in the ambulatory department every 6 months. The costs of each follow-up strategy were compared, using the actual billing documents issued by the French health insurance system, including costs of (i) (a) ICD-related ambulatory visits and transportation, (b) other ambulatory visits, (c) cardiovascular treatments and procedures, and (ii) hospitalizations for the management of cardiovascular events. The ICD and RM system costs were calculated on the basis of the device remaining longevity at the end of the study. The characteristics of the study groups were similar. Over a follow-up of 27 months, the mean non-hospital costs per patient-year were €1695 ± 1131 in the active, vs. €1952 ± 1023 in the control group (P = 0.04), a €257 difference mainly due to device management. The hospitalization costs per patient-year were €2829 ± 6382 and €3549 ± 9714 in the active and control groups, respectively (P = 0.46). Adding the ICD to the non-hospital costs, the savings were €494 (P = 0.005) or, when the monitoring system was included, €315 (P = 0.05) per patient-year.

Cost and cost-effectiveness of RM remain leading issues for its dissemination. The MONITOR-ICD study has been designed to assess costs, cost-effectiveness, and clinical benefits of RM versus standard-care follow-up in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial. Methods and results Patients indicated for single- or dual-chamber ICD are eligible for the study and are implanted an RM-capable Biotronik ICD (Lumax VR-T or Lumax DR-T; Biotronik SE \& Co KG, Berlin, Germany). Implantable cardioverter defibrillator programming and alert-based clinical responses in the RM group are highly standardized by protocol. As of December 2011, recruitment has been completed, and 416 patients have been enrolled. Subjects are followed-up for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 24 months, ending in January 2013. Disease-specific costs from a societal perspective have been defined as primary end point and will be compared between RM and standard-care groups. Secondary end points include ICD shocks (including appropriate and inappropriate shocks), cardiovascular hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality, and additional health economic end points.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The study was conducted to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of enhanced multi-disciplinary teams (EMDTs) vs. 'usual care' for the treatment of pressure ulcers in long term care (LTC) facilities in Ontario, Canada
METHODS: We conducted a multi-method study: a pragmatic cluster randomized stepped-wedge trial, ethnographic observation and in-depth interviews, and an economic evaluation. Long term care facilities (clusters) were randomly allocated to start dates of the intervention. An advance practice nurse (APN) with expertise in skin and wound care visited intervention facilities to educate staff on pressure ulcer prevention and treatment, supported by an off-site hospital based expert multi-disciplinary wound care team via email, telephone, or video link as needed. The primary outcome was rate of reduction in pressure ulcer surface area (cm2/day) measured on before and after standard photographs by an assessor blinded to facility allocation. Secondary outcomes were time to healing, probability of healing, pressure ulcer incidence, pressure ulcer prevalence, wound pain, hospitalization, emergency department visits, utility, and cost.
RESULTS: 12 of 15 eligible LTC facilities were randomly selected to participate and randomized to start date of the intervention following the stepped wedge design. 137 residents with a total of 259 pressure ulcers (stage 2 or greater) were recruited over the 17 month study period. No statistically significant differences were found between control and intervention periods on any of the primary or secondary outcomes. The economic evaluation demonstrated a mean reduction in direct care costs of \$650 per resident compared to 'usual care'. The qualitative study suggested that onsite support by APN wound specialists was welcomed, and is responsible for reduced costs through discontinuation of expensive non evidence based treatments. Insufficient allocation of nursing home staff time to wound care may explain the lack of impact on healing.
CONCLUSION: Enhanced multi-disciplinary wound care teams were cost effective, with most benefit through cost reduction initiated by APNs, but did not improve the treatment of pressure ulcers in nursing homes. Policy makers should consider the potential yield of strengthening evidence based primary care within LTC facilities, through outreach by APNs.

	abstract = {Despite the efforts of the healthcare community to improve the quality of diabetes care, about 50\% of people with type 2 diabetes do not reach their treatment targets, increasing the risk of future micro-and macro-vascular complications. Diabetes self-management education has been shown to contribute to better disease control. However, it is not known which strategies involving educational programs are cost-effective. Telehealth applications might support chronic disease management. Transferability of successful distant patient self-management support programs to the Belgian setting needs to be confirmed by studies of a high methodological quality. "The COACH Program" was developed in Australia as target driven educational telephone delivered intervention to support people with different chronic conditions. It proved to be effective in patients with coronary heart disease after hospitalization. Clinical and cost-effectiveness of The COACH Program in people with type 2 diabetes in Belgium needs to be assessed. Randomized controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients were selected based on their medication consumption data and were recruited by their sickness fund. They were randomized to receive either usual care plus "The COACH Program" or usual care alone. The study will assess the difference in outcomes between groups. The primary outcome measure is the level of HbA1c. The secondary outcomes are: Total Cholesterol, LDL-Cholesterol, HDL-Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Blood Pressure, body mass index, smoking status; proportion of people at target for HbA1c, LDL-Cholesterol and Blood Pressure; self-perceived health status, diabetes-specific emotional distress and satisfaction with diabetes care. The follow-up period is 18 months. Within-trial and modeled cost-utility analyses, to project effects over life-time horizon beyond the trial duration, will be undertaken from the perspective of the health care system if the intervention is effective. The study will enhance our understanding of the potential of telehealth in diabetes management in Belgium. Research on the clinical effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness is essential to support policy makers in future reimbursement and implementation decisions.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In total, 95 patients with type 2 diabetes who had a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of {\textgreater}7\% were recruited from six community health centers in remote areas in Changhua County, Taiwan. All patients were randomly divided into intervention (shared care combined with telecare) and usual-care groups and followed up for 6 months.
RESULTS: The decrease in HbA1c level was significantly greater in the intervention group than in the usual-care group (0.7 ± 1.3\% versus 0.1 ± 1.0\%, p=0.03). There were no significant differences in lipid profiles and blood pressure changes between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Shared care combined with telecare could significantly reduce HbA1c levels in type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycemic control in underserved rural communities. Further studies should be conducted to clarify the target users and to develop cost-effective interventions.},

	abstract = {Purpose Retinopathy of prematuity screening is the key element for good ROP care allowing well timed treatment which can result in highly successful results from laser and early vitrectomy treatment. Customarily ROP screening has been done by doctors doing on average at our institution 6 exam per baby prior to Discharge from the NICU. ROP is a very serious Disease but only about 18\% of eyes require treatment by a physician. In adDition bedside exams are often documented by retinal drawing by the doctor which can lead to human error. A photograph can be stuDied and shared with accuracy with the neonatologist, NICU sta , and parents, and sent for remote reaDings by skilled readers in any location avoiDing travel time for the examiner and time in the nursery. Handling of images must follow privacy laws and provide accurate representation of retinal finDings that trigger bedside exam and treatment. It has been proven in several stuDies that telemeDicine can transfer images accurately, but software also can be designed to reduce human error. Methods FocusROP software was designed to reduce human error in two areas of telemeDicine, as well as reducing the need for doctor time doing ROP examinations in the NICU, thereby reducing cost of ROP screening and proviDing photographic documentation. Two areas of potential human error are image uploaDing by the NICU nurse and, for doctors, timing of the next examination as ROP is very time sensitive. Exams that extend the next exam by only a few weeks can result in a Disasterous sequence of events and missing a treatment interval. The FocusROP software overcomes these issues by using an oriented upload pattern that makes erroneous image loaDing less possible, and the examination schedual is fixed based on the observed finDings and randomized study recommendations and not changeable by the doctor, therefore error in exam schedule is not possible. We have used this system in a two hospital system for 3 years, well over 2 500 exams. Results We have reduced the inDicated doctor preformed bedside exams by 84\% and no baby has missed a treatment interval. After instruction there were only 10 uploaDing errors by NICU nurses. Conclusions Photographic documentation and telemeDicine management of ROP care with intelligent software can provide better documentation, safer screening, and less doctor time going to and in the NICU therefore reducing cost of ROP screening . TelemeDicine for ROP is the future of screening for ROP.},

Telehealth is an innovative resource that can enhance care within this framework by increasing access and reducing travel-related costs. Research suggests that these implementations lead to increased patient satisfaction, cost savings and equal or better clinical outcomes, but they have not been well-studied in PD.DESIGN/METHODS: Randomized-controlled trial. Video telehealth took place at a VA facility nearer to the patient (“outreach telehealth”) or in the patient's home (“home telehealth”). The control group received usual, in-office care. Patient satisfaction, assessed at 6 and 12 month visits by quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews, was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included measures of quality of life (PDQ-8), depression, travel cost, and clinical events (ED visits, admissions, provider phone contacts, and clinical referrals). T-test and chi-square analyses will examine quantitative differences between groups. Qualitative analysis of post-telehealth patient interviews will be conducted. Data collection will conclude in January 2014.RESULTS: 86 male patients were enrolled (home telehealth:18 active, 18 control; outreach telehealth:26 active, 24 control) with a mean age of 73 (Range: 42-87). There were no significant differences between baseline characteristics of active and controls in each arm (p{\textgreater}0.05). 38\% of PD patients in our clinic were eligible; with 62\% of these enrolling. 43 patients have completed the 12 month study, 11 died before completion and 11 withdrew.CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of studying telehealth for PD in a PCMH model has been demonstrated. As telehealth programs expand, it will be important to define their role in PD, and these findings will represent the largest study to date on this important topic.},

	abstract = {Background: Telestroke services help to improve stroke thrombolysis access at hospitals where 24/7 on-site expert coverage is challenging. However, regional telestroke can still leave services underserved especially during difficult to cover night-time hours. In an effort to improve service access we explored the feasibility of a cost neutral reciprocal international arrangement between a Scottish and a New Zealand stroke service providing telestroke to each others' patients during the night-time period taking advantage of international time zone differences. Methods: Following a complex implementation phase related to anticipated medico-legal issues we conducted a sixteen week non-randomised observational feasibility pilot weekdays 9pm-9am. Patients were recruited prospectively and both patients and medical staff were interviewed following assessment. Time frames and outcomes were captured. Results: From 20 September 2013-10 January 2014 five patients were assessed by an overseas consultant utilising telestroke. Two of these were treated and experienced excellent recovery. Three patients were not treated: one because of spontaneous symptom resolution, one due to intracerebral haemorrhage, and one because symptoms appeared non-organic. All five decisions were deemed appropriate by the local clinicians upon full face-to-face assessment the following day. Both patient and staff feed-back have been positive and supportive without any significant concerns raised. No significant technical issues occurred. Referral to treatment times were 63 and 50 minutes; these time frames are similar when patients are assessed locally and the delays relate primarily to obtaining brain imaging after hours as a technician has to drive in from home. Conclusions: Preliminary findings indicate that an International Telestroke Service is feasible. A much larger study is planned to more comprehensively assess treatment delays, patient outcomes, and service costs.},

	abstract = {PCIT is an evidence-based behavioral intervention for children exhibiting emotional and behavioral disorders (Brinkmeyer \& Eyberg, 2003). PCIT has been found to have several profound short-and long-term effects for families who graduate from treatment. However, attrition rates for PCIT have ranged from 32 to 56\%. Children who prematurely drop out of treatment continue to demonstrate significant problems over time. Another particular difficulty of behavioral parent training programs is generalization of skills to natural environments. That is, PCIT therapists find that families may not practice the learned parenting skills outside of session in the manner that they were intended. Parents may also have difficulties using the skills effectively during real interactions with their child in their natural environment versus a simulated interaction during actual therapy sessions. While PCIT Therapists provide parents with handouts that explain skills in more detail, parents often misplace handouts given to them. Further, the extent that written materials match a parents' learning style may also dictate rate of CDI and PDI concept and skill acquisition. These treatment limitations may impact the rate at which families complete treatment and ultimately the number of families who can receive PCIT. As such, mechanisms for increasing family engagement in therapy and retention into services are needed to improve the overall long-term functioning of families. To help increase family engagement in therapy and retention into services, UM PCIT and UM TeleHealth is developing a mobile PCIT app. This mobile app will provide families with constant access to support and resources outside of therapy sessions. Specifically, this app will provide parents with a multimedia resource that includes video and audio demonstrations and examples of skills and treatment strategies (e.g. video examples of using PRIDE skills during special time and in natural environments, how to use time-out in public places, etc.). The aim of the study is to determine if usage of a PCIT app during therapy increases the efficiency of treatment and allows families to graduate in fewer sessions relative to traditional PCIT. Specifically, families will be randomly assigned to receive traditional PCIT services or receive PCIT plus mobile app services. Results will be measured by examining the number of sessions needed to reach CDI and PDI mastery and treatment completion with the mobile app compared to traditional PCIT. Further, it is expected that there will less attrition in the PCIT plus mobile app group as families will have access to more resources to learn and understand PCIT skills. Gaining insight on the ability of a PCIT app to improve treatment efficiency may not only help more children who exhibit emotional and behavioral disorders, and strengthen the quality of parent-child interactions, but also result in significant healthcare savings, as shorter treatment length means less costs associated with therapist time, family transportation, space, materials, and equipment.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study evaluated the impact of an Internet-based telematic system on the economic and clinical management of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Research Design and Methods: This 6-month prospective, randomized, comparative, open, multicenter study included patients with type 1 diabetes {\textgreater}18 years old treated with multiple insulin doses and with a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of {\textgreater}8\%. We compared an intervention group (IG) (two face-to-face and five telematic appointments) with a control group (CG) (seven face-to-face appointments). The variables studied were (1) patient and healthcare team costs, (2) metabolic control, (3) knowledge of diabetes, (4) quality of life, and (5) self-care treatment adherence. Results: Of the 154 patients included, 118 (76.6\%) completed the study (IG, 54; CG, 64). The time used by the CG to follow the program was 823±645min versus 353±222min in the IG (P{\textless}0.0001). Compared with the CG, the IG required less healthcare time from the professionals (288±105min vs. 232±89min; P{\textless}0.001). HbA1c improved in both groups (IG, 9.2±1.5\% [77.0±17.0mmol/mol] vs. 8.7±1.5\% [71.6±17.0mmol/mol] [P{\textless}0.001]; CG, 9.2±0.9\% [77.0±10.0mmol/mol] vs. 8.6±0.9\% [70.5±10.0mmol/mol] [P{\textless}0.001], as did knowledge and self-care treatment adherence. Conclusions: The use of interactive telematic appointments in subjects with type 1 diabetes and inadequate metabolic control is an efficient strategy, providing results comparable to those of face-to-face appointments in relation to improvement in glycemic control, knowledge acquisition, and self-care treatment adherence, with a significant reduction in the time used, especially by patients. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.},

	abstract = {Background: The increasing prevalence and associated cost of treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unsustainable, and focus is needed on self-management and prevention of hospital admissions. Telehealth monitoring of patients' vital signs allows clinicians to prioritise their workload and enables patients to take more responsibility for their health. This paper reports the results of a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Telehealth-supported care within a community-based COPD supported-discharge service.Methods: A two-arm pragmatic pilot RCT was conducted comparing the standard service with a Telehealth-supported service and assessed the potential for progressing into a full RCT. The co-primary outcome measures were the proportion of COPD patients readmitted to hospital and changes in patients' self-reported quality of life. The objectives were to assess the suitability of the methodology, produce a sample size calculation for a full RCT, and to give an indication of cost-effectiveness for both pathways. Results: Sixty three participants were recruited (n = 31 Standard; n = 32 Telehealth); 15 participants were excluded from analysis due to inadequate data completion or withdrawal from the Telehealth arm. Recruitment was slow with significant gaps in data collection, due predominantly to an unanticipated 60\% reduction of staff capacity within the clinical team. The sample size calculation was guided by estimates of clinically important effects and COPD readmission rates derived from the literature. Descriptive analyses showed that the standard service group had a lower proportion of patients with hospital readmissions and a greater increase in self-reported quality of life compared to the Telehealth-supported group. Telehealth was cost-effective only if hospital admissions data were excluded. Conclusions: Slow recruitment rates and service reconfigurations prevented progression to a full RCT. Although there are advantages to conducting an RCT with data collection conducted by a frontline clinical team, in this case, challenges arose when resources within the team were reduced by external events. Gaps in data collection were resolved by recruiting a research nurse. This study reinforces previous findings regarding the difficulty of undertaking evaluation of complex interventions, and provides recommendations for the introduction and evaluation of complex interventions within clinical settings, such as prioritisation of research within the clinical remit.

A randomized controlled trial was carried out over four months with 45 patients treated with long-term oxygen therapy, 24 in the telehealth group (TG) and 21 in the control group (CG). The analysis took into account whether the severity of comorbidity (defined as the presence of additional chronic diseases co-occurring with COPD) was associated with differences in costs and/or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results of cost-utility analysis were expressed in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The average total cost was €2300 for the TG and €1103 for the CG, and the average QALY gain was 0.0059 for the TG and 0.0006 for the CG (resulting an ICER of 223,726 €/QALY). For patients without comorbidity, the average total cost was €855 for the TG and €1354 for the CG, and the average QALY gain was 0.0288 for the TG and 0.0082 for the CG (resulting in the telehealth programme being the dominant strategy). For patients with comorbidity, the average total cost was €2782 for the TG and €949 for the CG, and the average QALY gain was -0.0017 for the TG and -0.0041 for the CG (resulting an ICER of 754,592 €/QALY).

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy compliance is essential to treat patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). CPAP therapy prevalence is estimated at two-thirds of all home respiratory therapies, but health resources assigned to promote therapy compliance are reduced. A telemedicine-based approach for CPAP therapy management could be of great benefit for OSA patients. METHODS: In a multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) we compared two groups of recently diagnosed OSA patients receiving face-to-face vs Internet-based CPAP follow-up, where a web platform we previously developed (Isetta, ATS2012) supports the follow-up and visits are via videoconference. Both groups answer periodical surveys about sleep time, CPAP side effects, lifestyle and have two follow-up visits (month 1 and 3). At the end of the study (6 months) main outcomes will be CPAP compliance, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Considering patients who finalized the trial (72/140) compared with baseline, at 6 months face-to-face group reported improvement in sleepiness (Epworth 10.7±5.2 vs 5.4±3.6;p{\textless}0.001) as well as Internet-based group (10.7±5.1 vs 6.7±4.2;p{\textless}0.001). Also, the majority of both face-to-face and Internet-based patients reported absence of either mask leaks (70.2\% vs 57.1\%;p=0.327) and nasal congestion (80.0\% vs 79.4\%;p=1). CONCLUSION: At 6 months, both groups showed improvement in sleepiness and similar outcomes in mask leaks and nasal congestion. These preliminary results suggest that a telemedicine-based strategy can be as effective as the face-to-face approach in OSA patients' management. The final results will build solid evidence on clinical impact.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Innovative models of care are critical in the management of chronic diseases and its associated costs. The management of chronic pulmonary disease (CPD) requires an interdisciplinary approach to patient education on disease self-management and clinical surveillance through a patient partnership and empowerment model of care. In 2010-2011, the Regional home care service (RHCS) for patients with chronic pulmonary disease of the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital participated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the costs of Telehomecare Remote Monitoring (TRM) and usual care for patients with severe COPD. The study showed that TRM decreased ER visits, hospitalisations and most significantly, hospital stay and in home visits. An annual savings of \$1613 per patient was generated representing a net gain of 14\%. Following the RCT, the RHCS continues to offer TRM as part of their range of services and clinical performance indicators are followed on a regular basis. Methods: Over a period of 11 months, 109 patients with CPD were followed in TRM by two expert nurse clinicians acting as case managers (CM). Patients, from home, complete a clinical protocol questionnaire daily using a PAD or the WEB, enabling them to self-assess their general and respiratory health. The CM receives data from the patients and intervenes with them, their internal and external network by phone to address and resolve issues promptly. The CM promote, empower and reinforce patient self-management behavior changes through individualized education plans and specific interventions in areas of interest and pertinent to the patient's health objectives. Results: Clinical indicators showed that 8 to 9 (mean) phone interventions were required per day. 192 pulmonary exacerbations were followed over 11 months resulting in 25 ER visits and 61 hospitalizations. 66 planned in home visits were needed representing 0.6 in home visits per patients over 11 months. As part of our continuous quality improvement initiatives, new CPD clinical protocols were developed, peer reviewed and deployed. TRM program parameters and patient enrollment criteria have been established including the skills required for the clinical nurse experts. Conclusion: The clinical evidence supporting the value and the potential of TRM is clear and growing. TRM is contributing to the management of patients living with CPD through direct access to care and thus reducing preventable hospital visits. Qualitative clinical indicators are needed to measure patient's self-management and behavior changes.},

Participants in the usual care group received the standard 6-week hospital-based outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programme, including gym sessions. The cost of delivery by telehealth was slightly lower than for patients attending a rehabilitation service in person. From the provider's perspective, the telehealth intervention could be delivered for \$1633 per patient, compared to \$1845 for the usual care group. From the participant's perspective, patient travel costs for home rehabilitation were substantially less than for hospital attendance (\$80 vs \$400). Cardiac rehabilitation by telehealth offers obvious advantages and the option should be available to all patients who are eligible for cardiac rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Telemedicine seems to offer reliable solutions to recent health challenges, but contradictory results were recently found (Hall, Ann Intern Med 2012). Consequently, it is crucial to carefully select outcomes and target patients. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) therapy compliance is essential to treat patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). We believe that OSA patients could have greater benefit from a telemedicine approach for CPAP therapy management. Our aim was to evaluate the application of a new Internet-based strategy for the CPAP therapy follow-up of OSA patients. METHODS In a multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) we have compared two groups of recently diagnosed OSA patients receiving face-to-face vs. Internet-based CPAP follow-up, in which the follow-up is supported by the use of a web platform previously developed and validated by our group (Isetta, ERS 2011 and ATS 2102) and follow-up visits are performed via videoconference. Both groups answer periodical questionnaires about symptoms, sleep quality, CPAP side effects, physical activity and body weight and have two follow-up visits at first and third month. The Internet-based group is monitored through the web platform, where continuously updated patients' data are represented in a graphical format. At the end of the study (6 months), CPAP therapy compliance, quality of life and cost-effectiveness will be assessed. RESULTS Main differences between patients excluded (N=100) and included (N=128) were age (56.4±13.0 vs. 48.8±10.0 years; p{\textless}0.001) and graduate education level (7\% vs. 26\%; p{\textless}0.001). We found no significant differences in AHI (46.9±23.5 vs. 50.7±27.4 p=0.406) and Epworth (10.3±5.0 vs. 10.8±4.5 p=0.512). At 3 months both groups reported improvement in sleepiness and nasal congestion compared to basal situation, while Body Mass Index (BMI) remained unchanged. Among patients of face-to-face group 15.6\% had at least one extra visit with a physician, beyond the two follow-up visits scheduled in the trial, compared to 16.1\% of Internet-based group (p=1). In addition, 15.6\% of face-to-face group patients had at least an extra visit with a nurse, compared to 25.8\% of Internet group (p=0.359). CONCLUSIONS Major differences between included and excluded populations were age and education level. At 3 months face-to-face and Internet-based follow-up showed similar results in: self-reported sleepiness, nasal congestion, BMI and extra visits. These results suggest that a telemedicine-based strategy can be as effective as the standard face-to-face approach in OSA patients' management. The final results of our study together with further large RCT studies will build evidence of its clinical impact.},

	abstract = {Objective: Pain and depression are prevalent and treatable symptoms among patients with cancer, yet they are often undetected and undertreated. The Indiana Cancer Pain and Depression (INCPAD) trial demonstrated that telecare management can improve pain and depression outcomes. This article investigates the incremental cost effectiveness of the INCPAD intervention. Methods: The INCPAD trial was conducted in 16 community-based urban and rural oncology practices in Indiana. Of the 405 participants, 202 were randomized to the intervention group and 203 to the usual-care group. Intervention costs were determined, and effectiveness outcomes were depression-free days and quality-adjusted life years. Results: The intervention group was associated with a yearly increase of 60.3 depression-free days (S.E.= 15.4; P{\textless}. 0.01) and an increase of between 0.033 and 0.066 quality-adjusted life years compared to the usual care group. Total cost of the intervention per patient was US\$1189, which included physician, nurse care manager and automated monitoring set-up and maintenance costs. Incremental cost per depression-free day was US\$19.72, which yields a range of US\$18,018 to US\$36,035 per quality-adjusted life year when converted to that metric. When measured directly, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ranged from US\$10,826 based on the modified EQ-5D to US\$73,286.92 based on the SF-12. Conclusion: Centralized telecare management, coupled with automated symptom monitoring, appears to be a cost effective intervention for managing pain and depression in cancer patients.},

Design and methods: a pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial with nested economic evaluation. A total of 2,600 people with social care needs participated in a trial of community-based telecare in three English local authority areas. In the Whole Systems Demonstrator Telecare Questionnaire Study, 550 participants were randomised to intervention and 639 to control. Participants who were offered the telecare intervention received a package of equipment and monitoring services for 12 months, additional to their standard health and social care services. The control group received usual health and social care. Primary outcome measure: incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The analyses took a health and social care perspective. Results: cost per additional QALY was £297,000. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicated that the probability of costeffectiveness at a willingness-to-pay of £30,000 per QALY gained was only 16\%. Sensitivity analyses combining variations in equipment price and support cost parameters yielded a cost-effectiveness ratio of £161,000 per QALY. Implications: while QALY gain in the intervention group was similar to that for controls, social and health services costs were higher. Second-generation telecare did not appear to be a cost-effective addition to usual care, assuming a commonly accepted willingness to pay for QALYs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home-based exercise training in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has the potential to improve CR uptake, decrease costs and increase self-management skills. The FIT@Home study evaluates home-based CR with telemonitoring guidance using coaching interventions including strategies for behavioural changes with the aim to maintain adherence to a healthy lifestyle and to improve long-term effects. In this interim analysis we provide short-term results on exercise capacity, quality of life and training adherence of the first 50 patients included in the FIT@Home study.
DESIGN: The study design was a randomised controlled trial.
METHODS: Low to moderate risk CR patients were randomised to a 12-week home-based training (HT) programme or a 12-week centre-based training (CT) programme. In both groups, training was performed at 70-85\% of maximal heart rate (HRmax) for 45-60 min, 2-3 times per week. The HT group received three supervised training sessions, before commencing training with a heart rate monitor in their home environment. These patients received individual coaching by telephone weekly, based on training data uploaded on the Internet. The CT programme was performed under the direct supervision of a physical therapist. Exercise capacity and health-related quality of life were assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks.
RESULTS: CT (n = 25) and HT (n = 25) both showed a significant improvement in peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) (10\% and 14\% respectively) and quality of life after 12 weeks of training, without significant between-group differences. The average training intensity of the HT group was 73.3 ± 3.5\% of HRmax. Training adherence was similar between groups.
CONCLUSION: This analysis shows that HT with telemonitoring guidance has similar short-term effects on exercise capacity and quality of life as CT in CR patients.},

Mortality and hospital re-admissions for congestive heart failure were also reduced in integrated management patients (P{\textless}0.05). Integrated management was more expensive than usual care, although the cost of adverse events was 42\% lower. In heart failure patients at high risk of relapse, the regular acquisition of simple clinical information and the possibility for the patient to contact the clinical staff improved drug titration, produced better psychological status and quality of life, and reduced hospitalizations for heart failure.},

At baseline and end of program, the 6-min walking test (6MWT), Medical Research Council (MRC) scale and Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were administered. In TRP only, we assessed platform use, incremental exercise, steps walked/day and patient satisfaction. TRP patients completed all sessions without side effects, used the remote control 1,394 ± 2,329 times being in the 84\% of the cases satisfied with the service. In 22\% of the cases patients found the technology unfriendly. Each health-professional performed 46 ± 65 actions, 14.6 ± 2.12 phone calls and 1 ± 1.67 videoconference sessions per patient. TRP patients increased physical activity (3,412 vs. 1,863 steps/day, p = 0.0002). Both programs produced significant (all, p {\textless} 0.01) gains in 6MWT meters, TRP +34.22 ± 50.79; ORP +33.61 ± 39.25, dyspnea TRP - 0.72 ± 0.89; ORP - 0.94 ± 0.53 and SGRQ TRP - 6.9 ± 9.96, ORP - 9.9 ± 12.92 without between-group differences. In conclusion, TRP is feasible and well accepted by patients, although sometimes technology was perceived as difficult.

Methods: The project consisted of a 12 months follow-up study with a randomized clinical trial, which compared various quality indicators between home-based telepsychiatric aftercare via videoconferencing and face-to-face aftercare. Results: The final sample comprised 107 outpatients (53 in the telepsychiatry group and 54 in the control group). Among 1,227 realized consultations, 489 were held by videoconferencing. Satisfaction with the aftercare by videoconferencing and the medication delivery was high among patients. Attending psychiatrists were satisfied with the assistance by videoconferencing. Discussion: The experiences during this pilot project have overall been very positive and psychiatric outpatient care by videoconferencing seems viable to treat patients even in a resource-constrained environment.},

	abstract = {Background: We tested the efficacy of a remote tailored intervention Tele-Cancer Risk Assessment and Evaluation (TeleCARE) compared with a mailed educational brochure for improving colonoscopy uptake among at-risk relatives of colorectal cancer patients and examined subgroup differences based on participant reported cost barriers. Methods: Family members of colorectal cancer patients who were not up-to-date with colonoscopy were randomly assigned as family units to TeleCARE (N = 232) or an educational brochure (N = 249). At the 9-month follow-up, a cost resource letter listing resources for free or reduced-cost colonoscopy was mailed to participants who had reported cost barriers and remained nonadherent. Rates of medically verified colonoscopy at the 15-month follow-up were compared on the basis of group assignment and within group stratification by cost barriers. Results: In intent-to-treat analysis, 42.7\% of participants in TeleCARE and 24.1\% of participants in the educational brochure group had a medically verified colonoscopy [OR, 2.37; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.59-3.52]. Cost was identified as a barrier in both groups (TeleCARE= 62.5\%; educational brochure= 57.0\%). When cost was not a barrier, the TeleCARE group was almost four times as likely as the comparison to have a colonoscopy (OR, 3.66; 95\%CI, 1.85-7.24). The intervention was efficacious among those who reported cost barriers; the TeleCARE group was nearly twice as likely to have a colonoscopy (OR, 1.99; 95\% CI, 1.12-3.52). Conclusions: TeleCARE increased colonoscopy regardless of cost barriers. Impact: Remote interventions may bolster screening colonoscopy regardless of cost barriers and be more efficacious when cost barriers are absent.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: From 1992 to 2008, older adults in the United States incurred more healthcare expense per capita than any other age group. Home telemonitoring has emerged as a potential solution to reduce these costs, but evidence is mixed. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate whether the mean difference in total direct medical cost consequence between older adults receiving additional home telemonitoring care (TELE) (n=102) and those receiving usual medical care (UC) (n=103) were significant. Inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, decedents, survivors, and 30-day readmission costs were evaluated as secondary aim.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multivariate generalized linear models (GLMs) and parametric bootstrapping method were used to model cost and to determine significance of the cost differences. We also compared the differences in arithmetic mean costs.
RESULTS: From the conditional GLMs, the estimated mean cost differences (TELE versus UC) for total, inpatient, outpatient, and ED were -\$9,537 (p=0.068), -\$8,482 (p =0.098), -\$1,160 (p=0.177), and \$106 (p=0.619), respectively. Mean postenrollment cost was 11\% lower than the prior year for TELE versus 22\% higher for UC. The ratio of mean cost for decedents to survivors was 2.1:1 (TELE) versus 12.7:1 (UC).
CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the mean total cost between the two treatment groups. The TELE group had less variability in cost of care, lower decedents to survivors cost ratio, and lower total 30-day readmission cost than the UC group.},

Objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of remote cognitive assessment in patients with MS using the automated neuropsychological assessment metrics (ANAM-MS) and the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). Methods: patients meeting the McDonald criteria for MS (n = 24) were randomized to complete the live-in-office condition or a remote-in-office condition first, with all patients completing both sessions. Patients (n = 20) then completed a final remote-in-home testing session. Both remote sessions were proc-tored by a psychologist using a secure telehealth connection. Results: scores on the live SDMT differed from scores in the two remote settings F(2, 38) = 4.46, p = 0.018. However, summary scores on the ANAM-MS were similar across the three settings, F(2, 36) = 2.21, p = 0.124. Satisfaction with telehealth testing was high on the part of the examiner and patients. Each telehealth testing session saved more than \$144.00 in travel costs and lost wages. Conclusion: this study demonstrated that valid results can be obtained when evaluating patients remotely using ANAM-MS. Some differences were noted for the SDMT that suggest that either specific norms or a different implementation approach may be needed for telehealth.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In rural America, cigarette smoking is prevalent and health care providers lack the time and resources to help smokers quit. Telephone quitlines are important avenues for cessation services in rural areas, but they are poorly integrated with local health care resources.
OBJECTIVE: The intent of the study was to assess the comparative effectiveness and cost effectiveness of two models for delivering expert tobacco treatment at a distance: telemedicine counseling that was integrated into smokers' primary care clinics (Integrated Telemedicine-ITM) versus telephone counseling, similar to telephone quitline counseling, delivered to smokers in their homes (Phone).
METHODS: Smokers (n=566) were recruited offline from 20 primary care and safety net clinics across Kansas. They were randomly assigned to receive 4 sessions of ITM or 4 sessions of Phone counseling. Patients in ITM received real-time video counseling, similar to Skype, delivered by computer/webcams in clinic exam rooms. Three full-time equivalent trained counselors delivered the counseling. The counseling duration and content was the same in both groups and was available in Spanish or English. Both groups also received identical materials and assistance in selecting and obtaining cessation medications. The primary outcome was verified 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at month 12, using an intent-to-treat analysis.
RESULTS: There were no significant baseline differences between groups, and the trial achieved 88\% follow-up at 12 months. Verified abstinence at 12 months did not significantly differ between ITM or Phone (9.8\%, 27/280 vs 12\%, 34/286; P=.406). Phone participants completed somewhat more counseling sessions than ITM (mean 2.6, SD 1.5 vs mean 2.4, SD 1.5; P=.0837); however, participants in ITM were significantly more likely to use cessation medications than participants in Phone (55.9\%, 128/280 vs 46.1\%, 107/286; P=.03). Compared to Phone participants, ITM participants were significantly more likely to recommend the program to a family member or friend (P=.0075). From the combined provider plus participant (societal) perspective, Phone was significantly less costly than ITM. Participants in ITM had to incur time and mileage costs to travel to clinics for ITM sessions. From the provider perspective, counseling costs were similar between ITM (US \$45.46, SD 31.50) and Phone (US \$49.58, SD 33.35); however, total provider costs varied widely depending on how the clinic space for delivering ITM was valued.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings did not support the superiority of ITM over telephone counseling for helping rural patients quit smoking. ITM increased utilization of cessation pharmacotherapy and produced higher participant satisfaction, but Phone counseling was significantly less expensive. Future interventions could combine elements of both approaches to optimize pharmacotherapy utilization, counseling adherence, and satisfaction. Such an approach could commence with a telemedicine-delivered clinic office visit for pharmacotherapy guidance, and continue with telephone or real-time video counseling delivered via mobile phones to flexibly deliver behavioral support to patients where they most need it-in their homes and communities.

Design: Qualitative study adopting an interpretive descriptive approach. Participants: 23 patients, 6 nurses and 4 doctors who were participating in a RCT of blood glucose and BP telemonitoring. A maximum variation sample of patients from within the trial based on age, sex and deprivation status of the practice was sought. Setting: 12 primary care practices in Scotland and England. Method: Data were collected via recorded semistructured interviews. Analysis was inductive with themes presented within an overarching thematic framework. Multiple strategies were employed to ensure that the analysis was credible and trustworthy. Results: Telemonitoring of blood glucose, BP and weight by people with type 2 diabetes was feasible. The data generated by telemonitoring supported selfcare decisions and medical treatment decisions. Motivation to self-manage diet was increased by telemonitoring of blood glucose, and the 'benign policing' aspect of telemonitoring was considered by patients to be important. The convenience of home monitoring was very acceptable to patients although professionals had some concerns about telemonitoring increasing workload and costs. Conclusions: Telemonitoring of blood glucose, BP and weight in primary care is a promising way of improving diabetes management which would be highly acceptable to the type of patients who volunteered for this study.},

	abstract = {Background Notwithstanding the cardiovascular disease epidemic, current budgetary constraints do not allow for budget expansion of conventional cardiac rehabilitation programmes. Consequently, there is an increasing need for cost-effectiveness studies of alternative strategies such as telerehabilitation. The present study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive cardiac telerehabilitation programme. Design and methods This multi-centre randomized controlled trial comprised 140 cardiac rehabilitation patients, randomized (1:1) to a 24-week telerehabilitation programme in addition to conventional cardiac rehabilitation (intervention group) or to conventional cardiac rehabilitation alone (control group). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated based on intervention and health care costs (incremental cost), and the differential incremental quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Results The total average cost per patient was significantly lower in the intervention group (€2156 ± €126) than in the control group (€2720 ± €276) (p = 0.01) with an overall incremental cost of €-564.40. Dividing this incremental cost by the baseline adjusted differential incremental QALYs (0.026 QALYs) yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €-21,707/QALY. The number of days lost due to cardiovascular rehospitalizations in the intervention group (0.33 ± 0.15) was significantly lower than in the control group (0.79 ± 0.20) (p = 0.037). Conclusions This paper shows the addition of cardiac telerehabilitation to conventional centre-based cardiac rehabilitation to be more effective and efficient than centre-based cardiac rehabilitation alone. These results are useful for policy makers charged with deciding how limited health care resources should best be allocated in the era of exploding need.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of telecare on health related quality of life, self-care, hospital use, costs and the experiences of patients, informal carers and health care professionals.
METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned either to usual care or to additionally entering their data into a commercially-available electronic device that uploaded data once a day to a nurse-led monitoring station. Patients had congestive heart failure (Site A), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Site B), or any long-term condition, mostly diabetes (Site C). Site C contributed only intervention patients - they considered a usual care option to be unethical. The study took place in New Zealand between September 2010 and February 2012, and lasted 3 to 6 months for each patient. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (SF36). Data on experiences were collected by individual and group interviews and by questionnaire.
RESULTS: There were 171 patients (98 intervention, 73 control). Quality of life, self-efficacy and disease-specific measures did not change significantly, while anxiety and depression both decreased significantly with the intervention. Hospital admissions, days in hospital, emergency department visits, outpatient visits and costs did not differ significantly between the groups. Patients at all sites were universally positive. Many felt safer and more cared-for, and said that they and their family had learned more about managing their condition. Staff could all see potential benefits of telecare, and, after some initial technical problems, many staff felt that telecare enabled them to effectively monitor more patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Strongly positive patient and staff experiences and attitudes complement and contrast with small or non-significant quantitative changes. Telecare led to patients and families taking a more active role in self-management. It is likely that subgroups of patients benefitted in ways that were not measured or visible within the quantitative data, especially feelings of safety and being cared-for.

We believe that video conferencing has equivalent quality, connectivity, and ease of operation, can be done economically, and will improve evaluation. Methods Prospective randomized pilot study was used to examine video versus cellular communication between the medical command officer (MCO) and pediatric transport team (TT) for children with moderate to severe illness undergoing interhospital transport. Twenty-five patients were randomized to cellular communication, and 25 patients were randomized to video. The MCO completed a Likert scale to evaluate connection, quality, and ease of operation. Call durations were recorded. A Likert scale to evaluate the communication mode on patient care was completed. Results Connection and audio quality were equivalent and there were no dropped calls. Average call duration in the phone group was 186 versus 139 seconds in the video group (P = 0.055). The MCO survey results were the following: 100\% found video intuitive, 92\% felt that disposition based on phone report was difficult, 80\% felt that video provided better understanding of patient condition, 70\% felt that video assisted disposition, and 80\% believe that video should be used for transport. The iPad system offers a significant savings when compared with conventional telemedicine. Conclusions Video conferencing seems as easy to complete as phone with equivalent quality and connectivity. Duration of video was equivalent to phone conferencing. Surveyed MCOs believed that video conferencing improved assessment and disposition. The iPad-based conferencing provided significant savings when compared with conventional cart-based or robotic units.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation provided through home visits is part of the continuum of care after discharge from hospital following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). As demands for rehabilitation at home are growing and becoming more difficult to meet, in-home telerehabilitation has been proposed as an alternate service delivery method. However, there is a need for robust data concerning both the effectiveness and the cost of dispensing in-home telerehabilitation.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to document, analyze, and compare real costs of two service delivery methods: in-home telerehabilitation and conventional home visits.
METHODS: The economic analysis was conducted as part of a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) on telerehabilitation for TKA, and involved data from 197 patients, post-TKA. Twice a week for 8 weeks, participants received supervised physiotherapy via two delivery methods, depending on their study group allocation: in-home telerehabilitation (TELE) and home-visit rehabilitation (VISIT). Patients were recruited from eight hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada. The TELE group intervention was delivered by videoconferencing over high-speed Internet. The VISIT group received the same intervention at home. Costs related to the delivery of the two services (TELE and VISIT) were calculated. Student's t tests were used to compare costs per treatment between the two groups. To take distance into account, the two treatment groups were compared within distance strata using two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs).
RESULTS: The mean cost of a single session was Can \$93.08 for the VISIT group (SD \$35.70) and \$80.99 for the TELE group (SD \$26.60). When comparing both groups, real total cost analysis showed a cost differential in favor of the TELE group (TELE minus VISIT: -\$263, 95\% CI -\$382 to -\$143). However, when the patient's home was located less than 30 km round-trip from the health care center, the difference in costs between TELE and VISIT treatments was not significant (P=.25, .26, and .11 for the {\textless}10, 10-19, and 20-29 km strata, respectively). The cost of TELE treatments was lower than VISIT treatments when the distance was 30 km or more (30-49 km: \$81{\textless}\$103, P=.002; ≥50 km: \$90{\textless}\$152, P{\textless}.001).
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study of the actual costs of in-home telerehabilitation covering all subcosts of telerehabilitation and distance between the health care center and the patient's home. The cost for a single session of in-home telerehabilitation compared to conventional home-visit rehabilitation was lower or about the same, depending on the distance between the patient's home and health care center. Under the controlled conditions of an RCT, a favorable cost differential was observed when the patient was more than 30 km from the provider. Stakeholders and program planners can use these data to guide decisions regarding introducing telerehabilitation as a new service in their clinic.

The primary end-point of this randomized prospective multicentre health economic trial was the total FU-related cost for providers, comparing Home Monitoring facilitated FU (HM ON) to regular in-office FU (HM OFF) during the first 2 years after ICD implantation. Also the net financial impact on providers (taking national reimbursement into account) and costs from a healthcare payer perspective were evaluated. Methods and results A total of 312 patients with VVI- or DDD-ICD implants from 17 centres in six EU countries were randomised to HM ON or OFF, of which 303 were eligible for data analysis. For all contacts (in-office, calendar- or alert-triggered web-based review, discussions, calls) time-expenditure was tracked. Country-specific cost parameters were used to convert resource use into monetary values. Remote FU equipment itself was not included in the cost calculations. Given only two patients from Finland (one in each group) a monetary valuation analysis was not performed for Finland. Average age was 62.4 ± 13.1 years, 81\% were male, 39\% received a DDD system, and 51\% had a prophylactic ICD. Resource use with HM ON was clearly different: less FU visits (3.79 ± 1.67 vs. 5.53 ± 2.32; P {\textless} 0.001) despite a small increase of unscheduled visits (0.95 ± 1.50 vs. 0.62 ± 1.25; P {\textless} 0.005), more non-office-based contacts (1.95 ± 3.29 vs. 1.01 ± 2.64; P {\textless} 0.001), more Internet sessions (11.02 ± 15.28 vs. 0.06 ± 0.31; P {\textless} 0.001) and more in-clinic discussions (1.84 ± 4.20 vs. 1.28 ± 2.92; P {\textless} 0.03), but with numerically fewer hospitalizations (0.67 ± 1.18 vs. 0.85 ± 1.43, P = 0.23) and shorter length-of-stay (6.31 ± 15.5 vs. 8.26 ± 18.6; P = 0.27), although not significant. For the whole study population, the total FU cost for providers was not different for HM ON vs. OFF [mean (95\% CI): 204 (169-238) vs. 213 (182-243); range for difference (-36 to 54), NS]. From a payer perspective, FU-related costs were similar while the total cost per patient (including other physician visits, examinations, and hospitalizations) was numerically (but not significantly) lower. There was no difference in the net financial impact on providers [profit of 408 (327-489) vs. 400 (345-455); range for difference (-104 to 88), NS], but there was heterogeneity among countries, with less profit for providers in the absence of specific remote FU reimbursement (Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands) and maintained or increased profit in cases where such reimbursement exists (Germany and UK). Quality of life (SF-36) was not different. Conclusion For all the patients as a whole, FU-related costs for providers are not different for remote FU vs. purely in-office FU, despite reorganized care. However, disparity in the impact on provider budget among different countries illustrates the need for proper reimbursement to ensure effective remote FU implementation.},

	abstract = {Aim: It is still unclear whether telemonitoring reduces hospitalization and mortality in heart failure (HF) patients and whether adding an Information and Computing Technology-guided-disease-management-system (ICT-guided-DMS) improves clinical and patient reported outcomes or reduces healthcare costs. Methods: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was performed testing the effects of INnovative ICT-guided-DMS combined with Telemonitoring in OUtpatient clinics for Chronic HF patients (IN TOUCH) with in total 179 patients (mean age 69 years; 72\% male; 77\% in New York Heart Association Classification (NYHA) III-IV; mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 28\%). Patients were randomized to ICT-guided-DMS or to ICT-guided-DMS + telemonitoring with a follow-up of nine months. The composite endpoint included mortality, HF-readmission and change in health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). Results: In total 177 patients were eligible for analyses. The mean score of the primary composite endpoint was -0.63 in ICT-guided-DMS vs. -0.73 in ICT-guided-DMS + telemonitoring (mean difference 0.1, 95\% CI: -0.67 +0.82, p = 0.39). All-cause mortality in ICT-guided-DMS was 12\% versus 15\% in ICT-guided-DMS + telemonitoring (p = 0.27); HF-readmission 28\% vs. 27\% p = 0.87; all-cause readmission was 49\% vs. 51\% (p = 0.78). HR-QoL improved in most patients and was equal in both groups. Incremental costs were €1360 in favor of ICT-guided-DMS. ICT-guided-DMS + telemonitoring had significantly fewer HF-outpatient-clinic visits (p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusion: ICT-guided-DMS + telemonitoring for the management of HF patients did not affect the primary and secondary endpoints. However, we did find a reduction in visits to the HF-outpatient clinic in this group suggesting that telemonitoring might be safe to use in reorganizing HF-care with relatively low costs.},

A total of 110 patients with moderate to severe COPD were recruited from a specialist respiratory service in Northern Ireland.

Exclusion criteria were patients who had any respiratory disorder other than COPD, or were cognitively unable to learn the process of monitoring. Patients were randomised to receive six months of home telemonitoring with usual care, or six months of usual care. The primary outcome measure was disease-specific quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C). Of 100 patients completing the study, 48 patients were randomised to telemonitoring and 52 patients were randomised to the control group. The SGRQ-C scores improved significantly in the intervention group compared to usual care (P = 0.001). The HADS anxiety score was significantly higher in the telehealth group compared to the usual care group (P = 0.01). There were significantly more contacts with the Community Respiratory Team in the telemonitoring group compared to the control group (P = 0.029). There were no significant between group differences in EQ-5D scores, HADS depression scores, GP activity, emergency department visits, hospital admissions or exacerbations. The total cost to the health service of the intervention over the 6-month study period was £2039, giving an estimated ICER of £203,900.

A total of 256 patients were randomised to either telemonitoring or usual care. In the telemonitoring arm, the touch-screen telemonitoring equipment transmitted data to clinical teams monitoring the patients. Total healthcare costs were estimated over a 12-month period from a National Health Service perspective and quality adjusted life year (QALYs) were estimated by the EQ-5D tool. Telemonitoring was not significantly more costly than usual care (mean difference per patient £2065.90 (P {\textless} 0.18). The increased costs were predominantly due to telemonitoring service costs and non-significantly higher secondary care costs. Telemonitoring for COPD was not cost-effective at a base case of £137,277 per QALY with only 15\% probability of being cost-effective at the usual threshold of £30,000 per QALY. Although there was some statistical and methodological uncertainty in the measures used, telemonitoring was not cost-effective in the sensitivity analyses performed. It seems unlikely that a telemonitoring service of the kind that was trialled would be cost-effective in providing care for people with COPD.},

Methods: This study involved 201 patients M/F (M = 66\%) 18-75 years with an AHI ≥ 30/hr, in France (Paris region), 12 sites (7 hospitals and 5 private medical centers). Three randomizations have been applied: telemonitoring using GSM technology, device (RESMED/PHILIPS), auto-adjusted vs. constant PAP set at the P90 value measured at D7 After the setup of PAP, follow-up visits at D7, M1, M3 were done by the home-care provider and at M1 and M3 by the physicians. Data were fed into an electronic sleep medical record (DMS) everyday for review and alarms on compliance, leaks and residual index were set up for the HCP and the physicians. Patients had access to the dedicated site www. respiradom.fr, including the serious game “Inspiratio” and to their daily data in the DMS. Resource utilization was collected prospectively and valued from the viewpoint of the healthcare payer. Results: At inclusion both telemonitored and non-telemonitored arms were identical: age = 51.9 ± 11 years, BMI = 33.3 ± 0.5 kg/m2, Epworth = 12 ± 5.5, AHI = 52.8 ± 20.3/hr on average. Residual AHI at M3 were not significantly different between the two arms: 2.6 ± 3.1/hr. Compliance with treatment at M3 was high and identical in both arms: 5.25± 1.97 hr with telemonitoring vs. 5.31 ± 2.09 hr without. Associated costs were 360€/3 months with telemonitoring and 320€ without (P {\textless} 0.0001). Cost-efficacy analysis showed that telemonitoring is more expensive but associated with a slightly better outcome. Quality of life scores (SF36, FOSQ) were not significantly different. Patient satisfaction scores were positive with telemonitoring. Telemonitoring increased the physicians' workload, nevertheless they wished to continue its use. Conclusion: Telemonitoring is as efficient as routine care. It is more expensive but tends to be more effective. Patients and physicians are satisfied.},

However, there is minimal evidence to support the choice of on-site versus off-site models. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of on-site practice-based collaborative care (PBCC) versus off-site telemedicine-based collaborative care (TBCC) for depression in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Methods: In a multisite, randomized, pragmatic comparative cost-effectiveness trial, 19,285 patients were screened for depression, 2,863 (14.8\%) screened positive, and 364 were enrolled. Telephone interview data were collected at baseline and at six, 12, and 18 months. Base case analysis used Arkansas FQHC health care costs, and secondary analysis used national cost estimates. Effectiveness measures were depression-free days and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from depression-free days, the 12-Item Short-Form Survey, and the Quality of Well-Being (QWB) Scale. Nonparametric bootstrap with replacement methods were used to generate an empirical joint distribution of incremental costs and QALYs and acceptability curves. Results: The TBCC intervention resulted in more depressionfree days and QALYs but at a greater cost than the PBCC intervention. The disease-specific (depression-free day) and generic (QALY) incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were below their respective ICER thresholds for implementation, suggesting that the TBCC intervention was more cost effective than the PBCC intervention. Conclusions: These results support the cost-effectiveness of TBCC in medically underserved primary care settings. Information about whether to insource (make) or outsource (buy) depression care management is important, given the current interest in patient-centered medical homes, valuebased purchasing, and bundled payments for depression care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telehealth interventions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have focused primarily on stable outpatients. Telehealth designed to handle the acute exacerbation that normally requires hospitalization could also be of interest. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of home-based telehealth hospitalization with conventional hospitalization for exacerbation in severe COPD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-center, noninferiority, randomized, controlled effectiveness trial was conducted between June 2010 and December 2011. Patients with severe COPD admitted because of exacerbation were randomized 1:1 either to home-based telehealth hospitalization or to continue standard treatment and care at the hospital. The primary outcome was treatment failure defined as re-admission due to exacerbation in COPD within 30 days after initial discharge. The noninferiority margin was set at 20\% of the control group's risk of re-admission. Secondary outcomes were mortality, need for manual or mechanical ventilation or noninvasive ventilation, length of hospitalization, physiological parameters, health-related quality of life, user satisfaction, healthcare costs, and adverse events.
RESULTS: In total, 57 patients were randomized: 29 participants in the telehealth group and 28 participants in the control group. Testing the incidence of re-admission within 30 days after discharge could not confirm noninferiority (lower 95\% confidence limit [CL], -24.8\%; p=0.35). Results were also nonsignificant at 90 days (lower 95\% CL, -16.2\%; p=0.33) and 180 days (lower 95\% CL, -16.6\%; p =0.33) after discharge. Superiority testing on secondary outcomes showed nonsignificant differences between groups. Healthcare costs have not yet been evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: Whether home-based telehealth hospitalization is noninferior to conventional hospitalization requires further investigation. The results indicate that a subgroup of patients with severe COPD can be treated for acute exacerbation at home using telehealth, without the physical presence of health professionals and with a proper organizational "back-up."},

	abstract = {Purpose: A recent clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of home telemonitoring for early detection of incident choroidal neovascularization (CNV) among patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We conducted an economic evaluation of the potential cost-e ectiveness and government budgetary impacts of adoption of this technology among eligible Medicare patients. Methods: We developed a computer simulation model using effectiveness data from the AREDS2-HOME study, treatment data from the Treat and Extend Wills Eye Hospital study (T\&E), and AMD progression from the AREDS study. The model estimated the societal cost, 10-year federal budgetary impact, and the incremental cost-e ectiveness ratio (ICER) of telemonitoring patients with CNV in one eye or large drusen and pigment abnormalities in both eyes. We used alternative scenarios, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the effect of uncertainty in data and assumptions. Results: Compared to the AREDS2-HOME study control group we estimated home telemonitoring would cost \$1,707 from the societal perspective, cost \$1,923 per patient over 10 years from the federal government's perspective, and result in an ICER of \$40,286 (95\% C.I. savings-\$257,517) per QALY gained. Compared to CNV detection as observed in the T\&E study, telemonitoring leads to all-payer savings of more than \$6,285per person and a 10-year government costs of \$946. Coste ectiveness was highly sensitive to visual acuity at CNV diagnosis in the control group and the risk of bilateral CNV. When compared to real-world observed CNV detection rates, monitoring patients with existing CNV in one eye was cost-saving, while monitoring patients without CNV led to an ICER of \$95,825. Telemonitoring was cost-saving in scenarios in which we assumed early detection resulted in a reduction of one or more ranibizumab injection over 10 years. Conclusions: Home telemonitoring of AMD patients at risk for CNV was coste ective when compared to scheduled exams, but increased governmental costs by approximately \$2,000 per person over 10 years. Comparing the AREDS2-HOME study results to visual outcomes observed in a nonclinical trial community setting improved the ICER dramatically. The true cost-e ectiveness of home telemonitoring is likely to be driven largely by patients' risk for CNV, their frequency of examination without telemonitoring, and the ability of early detection to avoid one or more injections of ranibizumab.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The current approach for detecting serious retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants at risk requires an examination by an ophthalmologist with experience in ROP. Such expertise is in short supply and comes with a high cost, and therefore alternative approaches are needed. We describe the training and certification process for obtaining ROP digital images by non-physician Certified Retinal Imagers (CRI) in the multicenter Telemedicine Approaches to evaluating acute-phase Retinopathy of Prematurity (e-ROP) Study. Methods: Non-physicians were trained to obtain a standard set of retinal images including disc central, disc right, disc left, disc up, and disc down by using the RetCam Shuttle (Clarity, Pleasanton, CA), a wide field imaging camera system (with 130° lens). The backgrounds of CRIs varied including NICU nurses, neonatal nurse practitioners, ophthalmic photographers, ocular coherent tomographers, and ophthalmic technologists. Certification consisted of onsite instruction by an experienced retinal imager from Clarity, hands on training during the Technical Group meeting, submitting a series of 3 sets of 6 images each to the e-ROP Reading Center for review and resubmission until satisfactory, a visit from the Office of Study Chair to evaluate imaging on site, and completion of a series of knowledge assessments. Quality and completeness of images was monitored throughout the Study duration. Results: Twenty six non-physician imagers in 12 clinical centers were certified as CRIs for the Study. They obtained 7905 gradable image sets. The completeness of image sets increased with experience (10.4\% incomplete during first 6 months vs 5.9\% during last 6 months, p{\textless}0.001). Also, the quality of images improved with experience (89\% gradable during first 6 months vs 93\% during last 6 months). Conclusions: Non-physicians can be successfully trained and certified for obtaining retinal images from infants with birth weights of {\textless}1251g of sufficient quality for grading in the severe ROP detection telemedicine system.},

The present study is an ongoing randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of prolonged exposure (PE) delivered via in person or home-based video telehealth modalities.
METHOD: A total of 52 veterans with combat-related PTSD were randomized to receive 8-12 weeks of PE through either home-based telehealth or standard in-person office-based care.
RESULTS: Participants evinced significant reductions in symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety from pre- to posttreatment across both conditions. Analyses conducted within a noninferiority framework suggested nonsignificant treatment outcome differences in clinician-reported PTSD and self-reported anxiety between the conditions. Results were inconclusive for self-reported PTSD and depression symptoms. Patient satisfaction ratings did not significantly differ between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that PE can be delivered via home-based telehealth with outcomes and satisfaction ratings comparable to in-person practices for certain symptoms, however additional research is needed. This modality has the potential to address stigma- and geographic-related barriers to treatment, such as travel time and cost.},

Home-based IVIG treatment offers potential benefits to patients in terms of quality of life, avoiding travelling time and costs. It also results in improved availability of hospital resources for treatment of patients with other neurological conditions. HOME LINK is a telemedicine system developed to provide an innovative solution for the management of patients treated with IVIg at home. It ensures a permanent monitoring of the patients using communicating medical devices and link together all actors of the management of Home-based IVIG treated patients including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and home-care companies. Home Link provides a medicalized teleassistance platform capable of handling any adverse event occurring during and/or after the treatment delivery. A team of doctors, caregivers, engineers and technicians are working together 24/7 to provide a secure and confidential medical monitoring service. A medico-economic study will evaluate the efficiency (cost-effectiveness) of the telemedicine system compared with traditional care. The method is the stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) design mainly used for evaluating interventions during routine implementation. In this approach, clusters, for example, geographical areas, and hospitals, are identified to take part in a cluster randomized trial and, before the trial begins, are randomly allocated a time when they are given the intervention. All the groups will receive the intervention, but the time when they receive this is randomly ordered. The stepped wedge CRCT design may require fewer clusters than a parallel CRCT design. It maximizes statistical power because the intervention effect is estimated not only by between-cluster comparisons but also by within-cluster comparisons. The stepped wedge CRCT design offers an alternative to other designs that can be applied in routine practice for intervention evaluation.},

This study assessed the utility and cost-effectiveness of an automated Diabetes Remote Monitoring and Management System (DRMS) in glycemic control versus usual care. Methods In this randomized, controlled study, patients with uncontrolled diabetes on insulin were randomized to use of the DRMS or usual care. Participants in both groups were followed up for 6 months and had 3 clinic visits at 0, 3, and 6 months. The DRMS used text messages or phone calls to remind patients to test their blood glucose and to report results via an automated system, with no human interaction unless a patient had severely high or low blood glucose. The DRMS made adjustments to insulin dose(s) based on validated algorithms. Participants reported medication adherence through the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8, and diabetes-specific quality of life through the diabetes Daily Quality of Life questionnaire. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted based on the estimated overall costs of DRMS and usual care. Findings A total of 98 patients were enrolled (59 [60\%] female; mean age, 59 years); 87 participants (89\%) completed follow-up. HbA1c was similar between the DRMS and control groups at 3 months (7.60\% vs 8.10\%) and at 6 months (8.10\% vs 7.90\%). Changes from baseline to 6 months were not statistically significant for self-reported medication adherence and diabetes-specific quality of life, with the exception of the Daily Quality of Life-Social/Vocational Concerns subscale score (P = 0.04). Implications An automated system like the DRMS may improve glycemic control to the same degree as usual clinic care and may significantly improve the social/vocational aspects of quality of life. Cost-effectiveness analysis found DRMS to be cost-effective when compared to usual care and suggests DRMS has a good scale of economy for program scale up. Further research is needed to determine how to sustain the benefits seen with the automated system over longer periods.},

Objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of remote cognitive assessment in patients with MS using the automated neuropsychological assessment metrics (ANAM-MS) and the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). Methods: patients meeting the McDonald criteria for MS (n = 24) were randomized to complete the live-in-office condition or a remote-in-office condition first, with all patients completing both sessions. Patients (n = 20) then completed a final remote-in-home testing session. Both remote sessions were proctored by a psychologist using a secure telehealth connection. Results: scores on the live SDMT differed from scores in the two remote settings F(2, 38) = 4.46, p = 0.018. However, summary scores on the ANAM-MS were similar across the three settings, F(2, 36) = 2.21, p = 0.124. Satisfaction with telehealth testing was high on the part of the examiner and patients. Each telehealth testing session saved more than \$144.00 in travel costs and lost wages. Conclusion: this study demonstrated that valid results can be obtained when evaluating patients remotely using ANAM-MS. Some differences were noted for the SDMT that suggest that either specific norms or a different implementation approach may be needed for telehealth.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes patients are usually started on a low dose of insulin and their dose is adjusted or "titrated" according to their blood glucose levels. Insulin titration administered through face-to-face visits with a clinician can be time consuming and logistically burdensome for patients, especially those of low socioeconomic status (SES). Given the wide use of mobile phones among this population, there is the potential to use short message service (SMS) text messaging and phone calls to perform insulin titration remotely.
OBJECTIVE: The goals of this pilot study were to (1) evaluate if our Mobile Insulin Titration Intervention (MITI) intervention using text messaging and phone calls was effective in helping patients reach their optimal insulin glargine dose within 12 weeks, (2) assess the feasibility of the intervention within our clinic setting and patient population, (3) collect data on the cost savings associated with the intervention, and (4) measure patient satisfaction with the intervention.
METHODS: This was a pilot study evaluating an intervention for patients requiring insulin glargine titration in the outpatient medical clinic of Bellevue Hospital Center in New York City. Patients in the intervention arm received weekday SMS text messages from a health management platform requesting their fasting blood glucose values. The clinic's diabetes nurse educator monitored the texted responses on the platform website each weekday for alarm values. Once a week, the nurse reviewed the glucose values, consulted the MITI titration algorithm, and called patients to adjust their insulin dose. Patients in the usual care arm continued to receive their standard clinic care for insulin titration. The primary outcome was whether a patient reached his/her optimal insulin glargine dose within 12 weeks.
RESULTS: A total of 61 patients consented and were randomized into the study. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the intervention arm reached their optimal insulin glargine dose than patients in the usual care arm (88\%, 29/33 vs 37\%, 10/27; P{\textless}.001). Patients responded to 84.3\% (420/498) of the SMS text messages requesting their blood glucose values. The nurse reached patients within 2 attempts or by voicemail 91\% of the time (90/99 assigned calls). When patients traveled to the clinic, they spent a median of 45 minutes (IQR 30-60) on travel and 39 minutes (IQR 30-64) waiting prior to appointments. A total of 61\% (37/61) of patients had appointment copays. After participating in the study, patients in the intervention arm reported higher treatment satisfaction than those in the usual care arm.
CONCLUSIONS: MITI is an effective way to help low-SES patients reach their optimal insulin glargine dose using basic SMS text messaging and phone calls. The intervention was feasible and patients were highly satisfied with their treatment. The intervention was cost saving in terms of time for patients, who were able to have their insulin titrated without multiple clinic appointments. Similar interventions should be explored to improve care for low-SES patients managing chronic disease.

	abstract = {Introduction: Home-based exercise training in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has the potential to improve CR uptake and decrease costs of CR. In addition, patients are expected to develop self-management skills during home-based CR, which will help them maintain an active lifestyle. The FIT@Home study evaluates physical fitness and physical activity levels after home-based CR with telemonitoring guidance. In this interim analysis we discuss the long-term results of home-based CR on physical fitness. Methods: This randomized controlled trial compared the long-term effects of a 12-week home-based (HB) training program with 12-week centre-based (CB) training program in low to moderate risk patients entering CR. The home-based group (n=45) received three supervised training sessions, before they started training with a heart rate monitor in their home environment. They received individual coaching by telephone based on objective training data uploaded on the Internet. The CB group (n=45) received regular exercise of similar duration and intensity under direct supervision of a physical therapist. Physical fitness was assessed by a cardiopulmonary exercise test at baseline, 12 weeks and 1 year. Results: Preliminary short term results show that exercise adherence of the HB group (n=36) was similar to the supervised CB group (n=40) in the first 12 weeks (HB: training frequency of twice a week, intensity of 73.6\% of HRmax). Patients in the HB and CB group showed a significant improvement in peakVO2 after 12 weeks training (14\% and 11\% respectively), without significant between-group differences (p=0.75). By February 2015, 34 patients (HB=17; CB=17) had completed the long term assessment of physical fitness. In both groups, physical fitness levels were maintained one year after the start of CR, without a significant difference between groups (p=0.52). Conclusion: This study shows that HB training with telemonitoring guidance has similar short term effects on physical fitness as regular CB training in CR patients. Although data from only 34 patients were available, long term analysis indicate that both groups were able to maintain their physical fitness levels. This study demonstrates that home-based cardiac rehabilitation is an effective alternative compared to regular centre-based training for low to moderate cardiac risk patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Evidence that home telemonitoring for patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) offers clinical benefit over usual care is controversial as is evidence of a health economic advantage. Methods: Between January 2010 and June 2013, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CHF were enrolled and randomly assigned to 2 study groups comprising usual care with and without an interactive bi-directional remote monitoring system (Motiva®). The primary endpoint in CardioBBEAT is the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) established by the groups' difference in total cost and in the combined clinical endpoint "days alive and not in hospital nor inpatient care per potential days in study" within the follow-up of 12 months. Results: A total of 621 predominantly male patients were enrolled, whereof 302 patients were assigned to the intervention group and 319 to the control group. Ischemic cardiomyopathy was the leading cause of heart failure. Despite randomization, subjects of the control group were more often in NYHA functional class III-IV, and exhibited peripheral edema and renal dysfunction more often. Additionally, the control and intervention groups differed in heart rhythm disorders. No differences existed regarding risk factor profile, comorbidities, echocardiographic parameters, especially left ventricular and diastolic diameter and ejection fraction, as well as functional test results, medication and quality of life. While the observed baseline differences may well be a play of chance, they are of clinical relevance. Therefore, the statistical analysis plan was extended to include adjusted analyses with respect to the baseline imbalances. Conclusions: CardioBBEAT provides prospective outcome data on both, clinical and health economic impact of home telemonitoring in CHF. The study differs by the use of a high evidence level randomized controlled trial (RCT) design along with actual cost data obtained from health insurance companies. Its results are conducive to informed political and economic decision-making with regard to home telemonitoring solutions as an option for health care. Overall, it contributes to developing advanced health economic evaluation instruments to be deployed within the specific context of the German Health Care System.},

	abstract = {Background Compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is essential in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), but adequate control is not always possible. This is clinically important because CPAP can reverse the morbidity and mortality associated with OSA. Telemedicine, with support provided via a web platform and video conferences, could represent a cost-effective alternative to standard care management. Aim To assess the telemedicine impact on treatment compliance, cost-effectiveness and improvement in quality of life (QoL) when compared with traditional face-to-face follow-up. Methods A randomised controlled trial was performed to compare a telemedicine-based CPAP follow-up strategy with standard face-to-face management. Consecutive OSA patients requiring CPAP treatment, with sufficient internet skills and who agreed to participate, were enrolled. They were followed-up at 1, 3 and 6 months and answered surveys about sleep, CPAP side effects and lifestyle. We compared CPAP compliance, cost-effectiveness and QoL between the beginning and the end of the study. A Bayesian cost-effectiveness analysis with non-informative priors was performed. Results We randomised 139 patients. At 6 months, we found similar levels of CPAP compliance, and improved daytime sleepiness, QoL, side effects and degree of satisfaction in both groups. Despite requiring more visits, the telemedicine group was more cost-effective: costs were lower and differences in effectiveness were not relevant. Conclusions A telemedicine-based strategy for the follow-up of CPAP treatment in patients with OSA was as effective as standard hospital-based care in terms of CPAP compliance and symptom improvement, with comparable side effects and satisfaction rates. The telemedicine-based strategy had lower total costs due to savings on transport and less lost productivity (indirect costs). Trial register number NCT01716676.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the global prevalence of insufficient physical activity (PA), effective interventions that attenuate age-related decline in PA levels are needed. Mobile phone interventions that positively affect health (mHealth) show promise; however, their impact on PA levels and fitness in young people is unclear and little is known about what makes a good mHealth app.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the effects of two commercially available smartphone apps (Zombies, Run and Get Running) on cardiorespiratory fitness and PA levels in insufficiently active healthy young people. A second aim was to identify the features of the app design that may contribute to improved fitness and PA levels.
METHODS: Apps for IMproving FITness (AIMFIT) was a 3-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants were recruited through advertisements in electronic mailing lists, local newspapers, flyers posted in community locations, and presentations at schools. Eligible young people aged 14-17 years were allocated at random to 1 of 3 conditions: (1) use of an immersive app (Zombies, Run), (2) use of a nonimmersive app (Get Running), or (3) usual behavior (control). Both smartphone apps consisted of a fully automated 8-week training program designed to improve fitness and ability to run 5 km; however, the immersive app featured a game-themed design and narrative. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using data collected face-to-face at baseline and 8 weeks, and all regression models were adjusted for baseline outcome value and gender. The primary outcome was cardiorespiratory fitness, objectively assessed as time to complete the 1-mile run/walk test at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were PA levels (accelerometry and self-reported), enjoyment, psychological need satisfaction, self-efficacy, and acceptability and usability of the apps.
RESULTS: A total of 51 participants were randomized to the immersive app intervention (n=17), nonimmersive app intervention (n=16), or the control group (n=18). The mean age of participants was 15.7 (SD 1.2) years; participants were mostly NZ Europeans (61\%, 31/51) and 57\% (29/51) were female. Overall retention rate was 96\% (49/51). There was no significant intervention effect on the primary outcome using either of the apps. Compared to the control, time to complete the fitness test was -28.4 seconds shorter (95\% CI -66.5 to 9.82, P=.20) for the immersive app group and -24.7 seconds (95\% CI -63.5 to 14.2, P=.32) for the nonimmersive app group. No significant intervention effects were found for secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Although apps have the ability to increase reach at a low cost, our pragmatic approach using readily available commercial apps as a stand-alone instrument did not have a significant effect on fitness. However, interest in future use of PA apps is promising and highlights a potentially important role of these tools in a multifaceted approach to increase fitness, promote PA, and consequently reduce the adverse health outcomes associated with insufficient activity.

	abstract = {Background: Evidence for the use of telephone consultation in childhood inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is lacking. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost consequences of telephone consultation compared with the usual out-patient face-to-face consultation for young people with IBD. Methods: We conducted a randomised-controlled trial in Manchester, UK, between July 12, 2010 and June 30, 2013. Young people (aged 8-16. years) with IBD were randomized to receive telephone consultation or face-to-face consultation for 24. months. The primary outcome measure was the paediatric IBD-specific IMPACT quality of life (QOL) score at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures included patient satisfaction with consultations, disease course, anthropometric measures, proportion of consultations attended, duration of consultations, and costs to the UK National Health Service (NHS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02319798. Findings: Eighty six patients were randomised to receive either telephone consultation (n = 44) or face-to-face consultation (n = 42). Baseline characteristics of the two groups were well balanced. At 12 months, there was no evidence of difference in QOL scores (estimated treatment effect in favour of the telephone consultation group was 5.7 points, 95\% CI - 2.9 to 14.3; p = 0.19). Mean consultation times were 9.8. min (IQR 8 to 12.3) for telephone consultation, and 14.3. min (11.6 to 17.0) for face-to-face consultation with an estimated reduction (95\% CI) of 4.3 (2.8 to 5.7) min in consultation times (p {\textless} 0.001). Telephone consultation had a mean cost of UK£35.41 per patient consultation compared with £51.12 for face-face consultation, difference £15.71 (95\% CI 11.8-19.6; P. {\textless} 0.001). Interpretation: We found no suggestion of inferiority of telephone consultation compared with face-to-face consultation with regard to improvements in QOL scores, and telephone consultation reduced consultation time and NHS costs. Telephone consultation is a cost-effective alternative to face-to-face consultation for the routine outpatient follow-up of children and adolescents with IBD.

This is of clinical importance as CPAP reverses OSA morbidity and mortality. Alternative and more cost-effective approaches are needed. A telemedicine-based strategy could be of great interest. Methods: One hundred thirty nine patients were randomized in a controlled trial that was performed to compare a telemedicine-based strategy for CPAP follow-up (patients' support based on a web platform support and videoconferences) with the standard face-to-face control. Main outcomes were CPAP compliance and cost-effectiveness (Bayesian analysis). Secondary outcomes: Quality of life (QoL), satisfaction and secondary effects questionaries. Results: At six months, similar levels of CPAP compliance, improvement in sleepiness, QoL, side effects and degree of satisfaction were found in both groups. Despite observing more extra visits, the telemedicine group was more cost-effective: costs were lower and difference in effectiveness was not relevant. Discussion: A telemedicine-based strategy for the follow-up of OSA patients under CPAP treatment proved to be as effective as the standard hospital-based care in terms of CPAP compliance and improvement. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the telemedicine-based strategy presented lower total costs due to savings on transport and indirect costs of productivity losses.},

	abstract = {The replacement of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) may give rise to considerable clinical consequences, the importance of which is underrated by the medical community. Replacement-related adverse events are difficult to identify and require monitoring of both short-term complications and long-term patient outcome. The aim of this study is to perform a structured evaluation of both short- and long-term adverse events and a cost analysis of consecutive ICD replacement procedures. Detect Long-term Complications After ICD Replacement (DECODE) is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter cohort study designed to estimate long-term complication rates (at 12 months and 5 years) in patients undergoing ICD generator replacement. The study will also evaluate predictors of complications, patient management before and during the replacement procedure in clinical practice, and the costs related to use of health care resources. About 800 consecutive patients with standard indications for ICD generator replacement will be enrolled in this study. The decision to undertake generator replacement/upgrade will be made according to the investigators' own judgment (which will be recorded). Patients will be followed for 60 months through periodic in-hospital examinations or remote monitoring. Detailed data on complications related to ICD replacement in current clinical practice are still lacking. The analysis of adverse events will reveal the value of new preventive strategies, thereby yielding both clinical and economic benefits. Moreover, assessment of complication rates after ICD replacement in a real-life setting will help estimate the actual long-term cost of ICD therapy and assess the real impact of increasing ICD longevity on cost-effectiveness.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Dutch government, hospitals, and health insurance companies have agreed on concentrating all specialist care in a few expert centers. This should lead to lower healthcare costs, but might also cause less accessible healthcare for patients living at a considerable distance from expert centers. A way to overcome less accessible healthcare, while maintaining reduced costs of medical care, is by using telemedicine between physician and patient.
METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, follow-up consultation between the patient and physician via a secured real-time video connection 6 weeks after plastic surgery of the face was compared to traditional in-person consultation after the same time interval. After the consultation, patients received an invite to fill in an online survey, which consisted of questionnaires assessing patient satisfaction (PSQ-18, TSQ) and communication experiences (PEQ), as well as questions about the time spent on different aspects of the consultations.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients participated. Overall satisfaction was equal for both groups, but a significant difference in the dimensions 'general satisfaction' (online consultation group more satisfied) and 'accessibility and convenience' (online consultation group less satisfied) was found. Patients reported significantly lower satisfaction in patient-physician communication in online consultation than in traditional in-person consultations. Patients were satisfied with the online consultation, and were willing to use the system again. Patients in the online consultation group experienced significantly less waiting time, and spent less time in total for the appointment.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall patients are equally satisfied with traditional consultation or real-time video consultation in plastic surgery. Online consultation is found to be a time-saving alternative to traditional consultation. However, online consultation is perceived by some patients as a negative influence on communication with the physician. Dedicated training for physicians in the use of online consultation is recommended to improve their online communicative skills.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To monitor and control the blood glucose levels in inefficiently insulin-treated patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) using a telemonitoring system and determine whether the improvement of HbA1c has a lasting effect following its discontinuation. DESIGN: Seventy inefficiently controlled insulin-treated DM patients using telemonitoring (telemonitoring group-TG) [HbA1c 9.9±2.3\% (85±24.9mmol/mol)] and 35 age-, body mass index (BMI)- and Hba1c-matched insulin-treated patients receiving outpatient care (control group-CG) [HbA1c 9.7±2.1\% (82±23.4mmol/mol)] were enrolled. Data of TG were transmitted from the glucose-meters to our computers via modem. Communication was achieved via e-mails and mobile phone text-messages through integrated software. HbA1c and BMI were evaluated at enrollment, 3 and 6 months, and 6 months after telemonitoring discontinuation. Frequency of hypo- and hyperglycemias and cost were also analyzed. RESULTS: Significant reduction in HbA1c was observed in TG both at 3 [7.1±1.0\% (54±10.5mmol/mol) p{\textless}0.001] and 6 months [6.9±0.9\% (52±9.5mmol/mol) p{\textless}0.001], compared to the CG group at the same timepoints. Significant reduction was also observed in the TG subgroups with HbA1c≥10\% and 10{\textgreater}HbA1c≥7.5\% at 3 and 6 months, compared to CG. No statistically significant differences in BMI were observed between TG and CG. Six months after telemonitoring discontinuation, HbA1c in TG was slightly increased [7.3±1.0\% (56±10.4mol/mol)]. Attenuation was also observed in both TG subgroups. Compared to CG, the number of monthly hypo- and hyperglycemias was reduced in TG. The intervention had a financial benefit for patients living more than 100 km from the health care provider. CONCLUSIONS: Telemonitoring can result in reduction of HbA1c and frequency of hypo- and hyperglycemias. This beneficial effect is slightly attenuated 6 months after terminating telemonitoring.},

Objective To investigate patient encounters in the outpatient setting using video visit (VV) technology compared to traditional office visits (OVs). Design, setting, and participants From June 2013 to March 2014, 55 prescreened men with a history of prostate cancer were prospectively randomized. VVs, with the patient at home or at work, were included in the outpatient clinic calendar of urologists. Intervention Remote VV versus traditional OV. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis An equivalence analysis was used to assess the primary outcome, visit efficiency as measured by time studies. Secondary outcomes were patient/provider satisfaction and costs. Results and limitations There were 28 VVs and 27 OVs. VVs were equivalent in efficiency to relative to OVs, as measured by patient-provider face time (mean 14.5 vs 14.3 min; p = 0.96), patient wait time (18.4 vs 13.0 min; p = 0.20), and total time devoted to care (17.9 vs 17.8 min; p = 0.97). There were no significant differences in patient perception of visit confidentiality, efficiency, education quality, or overall satisfaction. VVs incurred lower costs, including distance traveled (median 0 vs 95 miles), travel time (0 vs 95 min), missed work (0 vs 1 d), and money spent on travel (\$0 vs \$48; all p {\textless} 0.0001). There was a high level of urologist satisfaction for both VVs (88\%) and OVs (90\%). The major limitation was sample size. Conclusions VV in the ambulatory postprostatectomy setting may have a future role in health care delivery models. We found equivalent efficiency, similar satisfaction, but significantly reduced patient costs for VV compared to OV. Further prospective analyses are warranted. Patient summary Among men with surgically treated prostate cancer, we evaluated the utility of remote video visits compared to office visits for outpatient consultation with a urologist. Video visits were associated with equivalent efficiency, similar satisfaction, and significantly lower patient costs when compared to office visits. We conclude that video visits may have a future role in health care delivery models.},

	abstract = {METHODS: In this noninferiority, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT), patients from two primary care health centers in Toronto, Canada, with type 2 diabetes and a glycated hemoglobin/hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of ≥7.3\% (56.3 mmol/mol) were randomized to receive 6 months of health coaching with or without mobile phone monitoring support. We hypothesized that both approaches would result in significant HbA1c reductions, although health coaching with mobile phone monitoring would result in significantly larger effects. Participants were evaluated at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c from baseline to 6 months (difference between and within groups). Other outcomes included weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), satisfaction with life, depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), positive and negative affect (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS]), and quality of life (Short Form Health Survey-12 [SF-12]).
RESULTS: A total of 138 patients were randomized and 7 were excluded for a substudy; of the remaining 131, 67 were allocated to the intervention group and 64 to the control group. Primary outcome data were available for 97 participants (74.0\%). While both groups reduced their HbA1c levels, there were no significant between-group differences in change of HbA1c at 6 months using intention-to-treat (last observation carried forward [LOCF]) (P=.48) or per-protocol (P=.83) principles. However, the intervention group did achieve an accelerated HbA1c reduction, leading to a significant between-group difference at 3 months (P=.03). This difference was reduced at the 6-month follow-up as the control group continued to improve, achieving a reduction of 0.81\% (8.9 mmol/mol) (P=.001) compared with a reduction of 0.84\% (9.2 mmol/mol)(P=.001) in the intervention group. Intervention group participants also had significant decreases in weight (P=.006) and waist circumference (P=.01) while controls did not. Both groups reported improvements in mood, satisfaction with life, and quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Health coaching with and without access to mobile technology appeared to improve glucoregulation and mental health in a lower-SES, T2DM population. The accelerated improvement in the mobile phone group suggests the connectivity provided may more quickly improve adoption and adherence to health behaviors within a clinical diabetes management program. Overall, health coaching in primary care appears to lead to significant benefits for patients from lower-SES communities with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Adoptions of health behaviors are crucial for maintaining good health after type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnoses. However, adherence to glucoregulating behaviors like regular exercise and balanced diet can be challenging, especially for people living in lower-socioeconomic status (SES) communities. Providing cost-effective interventions that improve self-management is important for improving quality of life and the sustainability of health care systems.

This is clinically important because CPAP can reverse the morbidity and mortality associated with OSA. Telemedicine, with support provided via a web platform and video conferences, could represent a cost-effective alternative to standard care management. Aim: To assess the telemedicine impact on treatment compliance, cost-effectiveness and improvement in quality of life (QoL) when compared with traditional face-to-face follow-up. Methods: A randomised controlled trial was performed to compare a telemedicine-based CPAP follow-up strategy with standard face-to-face management. Consecutive OSA patients requiring CPAP treatment, with sufficient internet skills and who agreed to participate, were enrolled. They were followed-up at 1, 3 and 6 months and answered surveys about sleep, CPAP side effects and lifestyle. We compared CPAP compliance, cost-effectiveness and QoL between the beginning and the end of the study. A Bayesian cost-effectiveness analysis with non-informative priors was performed. Results: We randomised 139 patients. At 6 months, we found similar levels of CPAP compliance, and improved daytime sleepiness, QoL, side effects and degree of satisfaction in both groups. Despite requiring more visits, the telemedicine group was more cost-effective: costs were lower and differences in effectiveness were not relevant. Conclusions: A telemedicine-based strategy for the follow-up of CPAP treatment in patients with OSA was as effective as standard hospital-based care in terms of CPAP compliance and symptom improvement, with comparable side effects and satisfaction rates. The telemedicine-based strategy had lower total costs due to savings on transport and less lost productivity (indirect costs).},

We report cost, patient satisfaction and CGC attendance from a randomized trial comparing telegenetics with in-person CGC among individuals referred to CGC in four rural oncology clinics. Participants (n = 162) were randomized to receive CGC at their local oncology clinic in-person or via telegenetics. Cost analyses included telegenetics system; mileage; and personnel costs for genetic counselor, IT specialist, and clinic personnel. CGC attendance was tracked via study database. Patient satisfaction was assessed 1 week post-CGC via telephone survey using validated scales. Total costs were \$106 per telegenetics patient and \$244 per in-person patient. Patient satisfaction did not differ by group on either satisfaction scale. In-person patients were significantly more likely to attend CGC than telegenetics patients (89 vs. 79 \%, p = 0.03), with bivariate analyses showing an association between lesser computer comfort and lower attendance rate (Chi-square = 5.49, p = 0.02). Our randomized trial of telegenetics vs. in-person counseling found that telegenetics cost less than in-person counseling, with high satisfaction among those who attended. This study provides support for future randomized trials comparing multiple service delivery models on longer-term psychosocial and behavioral outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Society launched LivingWell@Home (LW@H) to provide telehealth services to clients in assisted living and home healthcare. LW@H assures client safety through remote monitoring of physiological parameters and assessment of nonbiometric parameters. Public policies increasingly support aging in place by allowing older adults with greater levels of impairment avoid or delay nursing home placement through alternative services offered in assisted living facilities and home healthcare agencies. Provider organizations face challenges caring for frail seniors with complex medical needs. Telehealth services may be helpful in supporting frail seniors living at home.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seniors were recruited into a randomized trial. Telehealth services were provided to 820 experimental subjects. Control subjects (n=762) received usual care. Clients rated their satisfaction at three points in time postimplementation: baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Fisher's exact test compared client ratings at each measurement interval.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found between experimental and control subjects at baseline. Statistically significant differences emerged at follow-up. Experimental subjects in home healthcare agencies reported higher levels of satisfaction relative to controls, whereas experimental subjects in assisted living facilities reported lower levels of satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth services increased the probability that clients will be more satisfied compared with those without telehealth in homecare agencies. The opposite effect resulted among assisted living residents. Value propositions among community-dwelling older adults may influence their satisfaction with telehealth services postimplementation. More research is needed to examine the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these services.},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the cost-effectiveness of the HIV Translating Initiatives for Depression Into Effective Solutions (HITIDES) intervention. Design: Randomized controlled effectiveness and implementation trial comparing depression collaborative care with enhanced usual care. Setting: Three Veterans Health Administration HIV clinics in the Southern United States. Subjects: Two hundred forty-nine HIV-infected patients completed the baseline interview; 123 were randomized to the intervention and 126 to usual care. Intervention: HITIDES consisted of an offsite HIV depression care team that delivered up to 12 months of collaborative care. The intervention used a stepped-care model for depression treatment, and specific recommendations were based on the Texas Medication Algorithm Project and the VA/Department of Defense Depression Treatment Guidelines. Main Outcome Measures: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, the Quality of Well Being Scale, and by converting depression-free days to QALYs. The base case analysis used outpatient, pharmacy, patient, and intervention costs. Cost-effectiveness was calculated using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net health benefit. ICER distributions were generated using nonparametric bootstrap with replacement sampling. Results: The HITIDES intervention was more effective and cost saving compared with usual care in 78\% of bootstrapped samples. The intervention net health benefit was positive and therefore deemed cost-effective using an ICER threshold of \$50,000/QALY. Conclusions: In HIV clinic settings, this intervention was more effective and cost saving compared with usual care. Implementation of offsite depression collaborative care programs in specialty care settings may be a strategy that not only improves outcomes for patients but also maximizes the efficient use of limited health care resources.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the economic impact of a telemedicine procedure designed to improve the quality of lung function testing (LFT) in primary care in a public healthcare system, compared with the standard method. Materials and methods: The economic impact of 9,039 LFTs performed in 51 health centers (2010-2013) using telespirometry (TS) compared to standard spirometry (SS) was studied. Results: TS costs more per unit than SS (€47.80 vs. €39.70) (2013), but the quality of the TS procedure is superior (84\% good quality, compared to 61\% using the standard procedure). Total cost of TS was €431,974 (compared with €358,306€ for SS), generating an economic impact of €73,668 (2013). The increase in cost for good quality LFT performed using TS was €34,030 (2010) and €144,295 (2013), while the costs of poor quality tests fell by €15,525 (2010) and 70,627€ (2013). Conclusion: The cost-effectiveness analysis concludes that TS is 23\% more expensive and 46\% more effective. Healthcare costs consequently fall as the number of LFTs performed by TS rises. Avoiding poor quality, invalid LFTs generates savings that compensate for the increased costs of performing LFTs with TS, making it a cost-effective method.},

However, it is not clear whether second opinion seeking should be promoted or discouraged and how second opinion services and policies can be better formalized to maximize the benefits and minimize the disadvantages. Methods: A nationwide survey was conducted with a representative sample of 678 physicians involved in cancer care (75.5\% participation rate) recruited in 13 cancer centres. Results: Most physicians involved with cancer care perceived patients' second opinion seeking as a legitimate right (96.0\%) and they acknowledged the need for second opinion services under certain conditions (98.2\%). Many believed that second opinions can enhance patient satisfaction (77.3\%) and quality of care (74.3\%), but they also had concerns about increase in healthcare and societal costs (91.3\%) and concentration in a high-volume centre (90.7\%). While the majority agreed with the involvement of the first opinion physicians in the second opinion services (69.5\%), there were mixed opinions regarding the desirability of remote (teleconsultation) second opinion services (49.0\%) and coverage by national health insurance (51.9\%). Conclusion: Physicians were generally positive to second opinion services and expected positive consequences in terms of patient satisfaction and quality of care. However, they had concerns about the consequences regarding cost and equity, and disagreements were observed regarding the way to improve second opinion services. The physicians' opinions revealed in our study will be helpful in developing clearer guidelines used to maximize the benefits of second opinion services.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Study Ear disorders result in over 12 million office visits per year. Smartphone attachments, like the CellScope Oto™ (CSO), enable a video of the ear canal and tympanic membrane to be transmitted wirelessly to a remote physician for cost-effective diagnosis and treatment. The device has been shown to be effective for remote diagnosis in a pediatric population and among emergency physicians. This study aimed to determine whether the device could be used effectively in patients seeking otolaryngology evaluation. We hypothesized that at least 25\% of clinic visits could be avoided with use of the device. Methods Used A prospective pilot study was conducted. Voluntary English-speaking patient-caregiver pairs presenting to an otolaryngology clinic were recruited. Caregivers were trained on use of the device, and then performed videootoscopic examinations without assistance. CSO videos were transmitted to a blinded physician for remote diagnosis. Patients attended their scheduled office visit with a provider who recorded an independent diagnosis without access to the CSO video. Data on patient and caregiver experience as well as remote provider perception and comfort with diagnosis were collected. Descriptive statistics were applied. Summary of Results Videootoscopies were collected from 28 ears from 14 patient-care-giver pairs. Caregivers found the device to be very user friendly, reporting a mean ease of use score of 4.54/5 [2-5], and comfort 4.61/5 [2-5]. Patients reported low discomfort scores of 1.57/10 [1-4]. Remote providers found the image quality to be comparable to clinic otoscopy equipment in 60.7\% of cases. They were comfortable making a diagnosis in 32.1\% of cases, and willing to initiate treatment in 32.1\% of cases. Conclusions The CSO appears to be an effective tool for remote diagnosis and treatment of ear conditions for many patients who might otherwise require travel to an otolaryngology clinic. The device has the potential to save significant time and travel expenses associated with medical visits.},

Patients hospitalized in a medically underserved area in Texas were randomized to receive care by endocrinologists via telemedicine (TELE; N=29) or non-endocrinologists by usual care (UC; N=28). Patients in the TELE group were treated with basal bolus therapy unless clinical circumstances dictated otherwise. The UC group received all care, including insulin management, from their hospitalist team. Point-of-care blood glucose (BG) readings were obtained pre-meal, bedtime and occasionally at 0300. BG readings obtained within one hour of previous readings were excluded to avoid ascertainment bias. Hospital day one readings were also excluded. Results are shown in the Table. The TELE group had significantly more BGs in the target range, fewer BGs in the higher than target range, and no differences in hypoglycemia as compared to the UC group.

We aimed to ascertain which mode of counselling, when used in combination with telemonitoring, is more effective at lifestyle modification intended to improve health status.
METHODS: Participants, who were residents of Kurihara city in Miyagi prefecture, Japan, were randomized into two groups: one group received individualized monthly documented reports (n = 33; 22 females; average age: 67.2 years), and the other received interactive videophone communication (n = 35; 22 females; average age: 65.1 years) for three months. Telemonitoring was conducted on both groups, using a pedometer, weighing scale and a sphygmomanometer. Pre- and post-intervention, anthropometric measurements and blood tests were performed; the participants also completed self-administered questionnaires.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The two groups showed similar degrees of health status improvement and satisfaction levels. However, the participants in the videophone group were more aware of improvements in their lifestyles than were the participants in the document group. The individualized printed communication programme was less time-consuming compared to videophone communication. Further studies are needed to formulate a balanced protocol for a counselling-cum-telemonitoring programme that provides optimal health improvement and cost performance with the available human resources.},

	abstract = {Objectives The objective of this study was to evaluate operational policies that may improve the proportion of eligible stroke patients within a population who would receive intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and minimize time to treatment in eligible patients. Methods In the context of a regional stroke team, the authors examined the effects of staff location and telemedicine deployment policies on the timeliness of thrombolytic treatment, and estimated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of six different policies. A process map comprising the steps from recognition of stroke symptoms to intravenous administration of rt-PA was constructed using data from published literature combined with expert opinion. Six scenarios were investigated: telemedicine deployment (none, all, or outer-ring hospitals only) and staff location (center of region or anywhere in region). Physician locations were randomly generated based on their zip codes of residence and work. The outcomes of interest were onset-to-treatment (OTT) time, door-to-needle (DTN) time, and the proportion of patients treated within 3 hours. A Monte Carlo simulation of the stroke team care-delivery system was constructed based on a primary data set of 121 ischemic stroke patients who were potentially eligible for treatment with rt-PA. Results With the physician located randomly in the region, deploying telemedicine at all hospitals in the region (compared with partial or no telemedicine) would result in the highest rates of treatment within 3 hours (80\% vs. 75\% vs. 70\%) and the shortest OTT (148 vs. 164 vs. 176 minutes) and DTN (45 vs. 61 vs. 73 minutes) times. However, locating the on-call physician centrally coupled with partial telemedicine deployment (five of the 17 hospitals) would be most cost-effective with comparable eligibility and treatment times. Conclusions Given the potential societal benefits, continued efforts to deploy telemedicine appear warranted. Aligning the incentives between those who would have to fund the up-front technology investments and those who will benefit over time from reduced ongoing health care expenses will be necessary to fully realize the benefits of telemedicine for stroke care.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This multidimensional capstone scholarship delivers a thoughtful investigation of telepsychiatry service. Over a one year time span, a comparison is analyzed capturing the intervention of telepsychiatry services compared to traditional in-person psychiatric services delivered to adults suffering from mental illness in rural underserved areas. The emerging role of the PMHNP is blended in utilizing the Clinical Scholar Model to support the telepsychiatry process change. CONTENT: The nation-wide shortage of psychiatric providers is igniting innovative ideas for delivering mental health treatment. Telepsychiatry captures the advantages of modern technology, connecting providers to those "hard to reach" patients and families around the globe. PMHNPs steeped in scientific scholarship, committed to quality care, and possessing leadership qualities, are well-suited for implementing a successful telepsychiatry process change. METHODOLOGY: Capturing the spirit of change, the Clinical Scholar Model can assist with implementing the telepsychiatry process utilizing the PMHNP role. Workshops developed could begin with promoting the spirit of inquiry through reflection and observation of community and organization needs, analysis and scientific critique of data, synthesis of evidence based peerreviewed articles, and application of telepsychiatry to a small sample size with evaluation of patient outcomes, and finally dissemination to community stake-holders. POPULATION: For purposes of the capstone project, the population included adults aged 18-65 living in rural communities with chronic mental illness, according to the DSM-IV-TR. RESULTS: Across the articles selected and small sample size in rural Wisconsin, commonalities were found. Telepsychiatry allows for the patient to remain in their community, receiving prompt and available mental health care with reduced costs, travel time and lost work time. Organizations using telepsychiatry had a reduction in provider cost, with less travel and lodging cost for the provider, and increased provider access. Empowerment to the patient and community was chiefly recognized when allowing the choice of telepsychiatry or traditional in person appointments. CONCLUSION: Satisfaction survey indicated overall an equivalency between traditional in person appointments and telepsychiatry. Patients in Taylor County, WI, provided positive reviews of the telepsychiatry process and technology. An electronic medical record system supports their telepsychiatry process, and allows for monitoring of clinical quality outcomes, including tracking psychiatric medication trials, BMI, laboratory data, and appointments. During an interview with their telepsychiatry provider, he revealed the unexpected benefits of removing barriers, mental health care stigma and enhancing transparent patient care.},

	abstract = {Objectives This study examined the differential impact of two telehealth programs for women caring for an older adult with a neurocognitive disorder. Outcomes examined were depressive symptoms, upset following disruptive behaviors, anxious and angry mood states, and caregiving self-efficacy. Methods Women cohabitating with a family member diagnosed with a neurocognitive disorder were assigned via random allocation to either of the following: (1) a 14-week behavioral intervention using video instructional materials, workbook and telephone coaching in behavioral management, pleasant events scheduling, and relaxation or (2) a basic education guide and telephone support comparison condition. Telephone assessments were conducted by interviewers blind to treatment condition at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 6 months following intervention. Results For those providing in-home care at post-treatment, depressive symptoms, upset following disruptive behaviors, and negative mood states were statistically lower in the behavioral coaching condition than in the basic education and support condition. Reliable change index analyses for Beck Depression Inventory II scores favored the behavioral coaching condition. Caregiving self-efficacy scores for obtaining respite and for managing patient behavioral disturbances were significantly higher in the coaching condition. Effect sizes were moderate but not maintained at the 6-month follow-up. Conclusions This study provides some initial evidence for the efficacy of a telehealth behavioral coaching intervention compared with basic education and telephone support. Carers' abilities to maintain strategy use during progressive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease likely require longer intervention contact than provided in the current study. Dementia carers, including those living in rural areas, can benefit from accessible and empirically supported interventions that can be easily disseminated across distances at modest cost.},

We explored the feasibility of a comprehensive, telemedicine-based OSA management pathway in a community-based Veteran cohort. Methods: This prospective, parallel-group randomized pilot study assessed feasibility of a telemedicine-based pathway for OSA evaluation and management in comparison to a more traditional, in-person care model. The study included 60 Veterans at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center and two affiliated community-based outpatient clinics. Telemedicine pathway feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes were assessed through a variety of quantitative (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, dropout rates, positive airway pressure [PAP] adherence rates, participant satisfaction ratings) and qualitative (verbal feedback) metrics. Results: There was no significant difference in functional outcome changes, patient satisfaction, dropout rates, or objectively measured PAP adherence between groups after 3 months of treatment. Telemedicine participants showed greater improvement in mental health scores, and their feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Conclusions: Our pilot study suggests that telemedicine-based management of OSA patients is feasible in terms of patient functional outcomes and overall satisfaction with care. Future studies should include larger populations to further elucidate these findings while assessing provider- and patient-related cost effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Background: Paediatric patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) face a life of repeated hospitalisations and frequent outpatient visits, which may affect social activities and increase absence from school and potentially reduce educational possibilities. Our aim was to optimise care by a novel telemedicine application and thereby allocating the patients' time and hospital resources to periods of active disease. Methods: IBD patients 10-17 years were prospectively randomised to an open-label case-control telemedicine intervention for 2 years with an inclusion period of 8 months. Patients in the telemedicine (web) group used the web-application young.constant-care.com, in which the disease burden was estimated by a patient-reported symptom score and faecal calprotectin (FC). The IBD-care team monitored the patients by weekly web-rounds and beside one annual preplanned visit, further outpatient visits were scheduled on demand in case of increased disease burden. The control group continued standard care by outpatient visit every third month including FC. Results: In the study, 53 patients (32 ulcerative colitis [UC], 21 Crohn's Disease [CD]) were included (27 web, 26 control); median duration of participations: web 86 weeks (IQR 36), control 92 weeks (IQR 20). Adherence using the telemedicine programme was 80\% (total 355 actual of 444 expected entries). Numbers of on demand outpatient visits in addition to the annual visit in the web group and the quarterly visits in the control group showed no difference; mean web 1,6 (SEM 0,5 CI 95\% 0.6;2.5) mean control 1.4 (SEM 0,4 CI 95\% 0.6;2.1). Numbers of total outpatient visits were 74 (2.7 per patient) in the web and 172(6.6 per patient) in the control group. This difference reflects a total outpatient-cost difference in Denmark of 10 022 Euro. No difference was found in time to first on demand visit and time to step-up in treatment intensity. Numbers of hospitalisations in the web group were 1 (in total 5 days) versus 7 (in total 18 days distributed at 5 patients) in the control group (no significant difference). No differences were observed regarding extra doctor and nurse telephone call or nurse consultations. Significant difference was observed in number of IBD-related absence days from school between the web (mean 1.4 days per patient, SEM 0.5) and control group (mean 15.7 days per patient, SEM 4.5 p = 0.002). Conclusions: Telemedicine in children and adolescence with IBD reduces the number of needed outpatient visit and hospitalisations without increasing the risk of step-up in medical treatment. Further, the web group had significant lower IBD-related absence days from school.},

	abstract = {Despite indirect evidence suggesting that chlorthalidone (CTD) is superior to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for preventing cardiovascular (CVD) events in patients with hypertension, HCTZ is far more widely used in clinical practice. The two drugs have never been compared directly in a large trial with CVD outcomes. We describe the design and early results of an NHLBI-funded R34 pilot study to plan such a multi-center clinical trial. The pilot study and full-scale clinical trial adhere to pragmatic trial principles and are conducted at low cost within large health systems. The pilot study is taking place at HealthPartners (Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN) and Kaiser Permanente Northwest (Portland, OR). Using a cluster-randomized design, we will allocate 40 primary care providers and their eligible hypertensive patients who currently use HCTZ (N=2000) to either convert to CTD (intervention group) or to continue HCTZ (usual care group). Eligible patients are age 18 and older, have a hypertension diagnosis, use HCTZ 12.5-50 mg as a single agent that is not part of a fixed-dose combination (but all other antihypertensive so are permitted), and do not have hypokalemia or hyponatremia. Patients taking HCTZ 12.5-25 mg will convert to CTD 12.5 mg, and patients taking HCTZ 50 mg will convert to CTD 25 mg. Otherwise, antihypertensive therapy will be managed by the primary care provider, including changing the patient back to HCTZ if deemed necessary. The study will use existing clinical infrastructure and electronic health records to identify eligible study patients, distribute study medication to intervention patients using methods similar to therapeutic substitution, and collect operational and outcomes data. For the pilot study, Aim 1 will document that the switch to CTD occurs as intended and measure adherence using pharmacy claims. Aim 2 will examine safety using electronic laboratory, blood pressure, and diagnosis code data. Aim 3 will refine the study design and identify critical factors for intervention success using a mixed-methods approach that includes interviews with study physicians, patients, pharmacists, and health system stakeholders. Aims 4 and 5 will refine estimates of sample size and per-participant costs for the full-scale trial. The pilot study will produce data that are necessary and sufficient to inform the planning of a full-scale trial comparing the effects of CTD and HCTZ on CVD outcomes. It will also advance the development of methods for low-cost pragmatic trials within learning health systems.},

Methods: The PONIENTE study was a controlled, non-randomised clinical trial, with data collected from informal caregivers, 12 months after implantation of pacemakers. The survey on disabilities, personal autonomy, and dependency situations was used to gather information on demographic and social characteristics, levels of professionalism, time and types of care, difficulties in providing care, health status, professional aspects, economic and family or leisure impacts due to informal caregiving for patients with pacemakers. Results: During 14 months, 76 caregivers were enrolled in the PONIENTE trial. Of which, 26 were included in the RM group and 50 in the hospital-monitored group (HM). The mean ages were 58.62 ± 16.51 and 61.10 ± 12.67 years, respectively (p = 0.56) in the groups, and 69.7 \% were females.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among patients who have had a heart attack, nearly half stop taking their statin medications within a year. Simple nudges such as individual adherence feedback or social incentives (peer pressure) might facilitate adherence. METHODS: We conducted a 6-month randomized controlled trial testing two different feedback approaches to improve medication adherence among veterans with CAD who had been prescribed a statin but were poorly adherent (defined as a medication possession ratio of {\textless}80 \%). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1. a control group that received an electronic pill monitoring device with no alarms or feedback; 2. an individual feedback group that received a daily alarm and a weekly medication adherence feedback report; and 3. a partner feedback group that received an alarm and a weekly feedback report that was shared with the participant and a selected partner (a friend, family member, or a similar peer struggling with statin adherence). The intervention continued for 3 months; participants were followed for an additional 3 months post-intervention. The primary outcome was adherence during the 3 months of the intervention. Secondary outcomes included change in LDL mg/dl, patient activation, and social support. RESULTS: We enrolled 126 patients. We used a stratified 2:2:3 block assignment to assign extra participants into the partner feedback arm since participants were being offered a choice of a family member or a peer (Control: 36, Individual Feedback: 36, Partner Feedback: 54). Demographic characteristics were similar across control and treatment groups. During the 3 month intervention period, medication adherence in both feedback arms was higher than in the control arm (89 \% in the individual feedback; 86 \% in the partner feedback; 67\%in the control group - p-value for comparison with control = 0.0011 and 0.0004, respectively). There was no significant difference in adherence between the 2 feedback groups. In the post-intervention period, when all feedback mechanisms were stopped, adherence rates dropped in both feedback groups. At 6 months there was no differences in medication adherence between the feedback groups and control (60 \% in individual feedback group; 52 \% in partner feedback group; 54 \% in the control group-p-value for comparison with control = 0.75 and 0.97, respectively). There were no changes relative to control in any of the other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Daily alarms combined with individual feedback reports or individual and partner feedback improved statin medication adherence in veterans with CAD and poor adherence. While neither individual feedback nor a partner feedback strategy created a sustainable medication adherence habit, the intervention itself is relatively easy to implement and low cost. If improved adherence continues if the intervention remains active, remote monitoring with adherence feedback could be a relatively simple way to improve long-term medication adherence.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition affecting nearly 5.7 million Americans and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. With an aging population, the cost associated with managing HF is expected to more than double from US \$31 billion in 2012 to US \$70 billion by 2030. Readmission rates for HF patients are high-25\% are readmitted at 30 days and nearly 50\% at 6 months. Low medication adherence contributes to poor HF management and higher readmission rates. Remote telehealth monitoring programs aimed at improved medication management and adherence may improve HF management and reduce readmissions.
OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this randomized controlled pilot study is to compare the MedSentry remote medication monitoring system versus usual care in older HF adult patients who recently completed a HF telemonitoring program. We hypothesized that remote medication monitoring would be associated with fewer unplanned hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits, increased medication adherence, and improved health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to usual care.
METHODS: Participants were randomized to usual care or use of the remote medication monitoring system for 90 days. Twenty-nine participants were enrolled and the final analytic sample consisted of 25 participants. Participants completed questionnaires at enrollment and closeout to gather data on medication adherence, health status, and HRQoL. Electronic medical records were reviewed for data on baseline classification of heart function and the number of unplanned hospitalizations and ED visits during the study period.
RESULTS: Use of the medication monitoring system was associated with an 80\% reduction in the risk of all-cause hospitalization and a significant decrease in the number of all-cause hospitalization length of stay in the intervention arm compared to usual care. Objective device data indicated high adherence rates (95\%-99\%) among intervention group participants despite finding no significant difference in self-reported adherence between study arms. The intervention group had poorer heart function and HRQoL at baseline, and HRQoL declined significantly in the intervention group compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The MedSentry medication monitoring system is a promising technology that merits continued development and evaluation. The MedSentry medication monitoring system may be useful both as a standalone system for patients with complex medication regimens or used to complement existing HF telemonitoring interventions. We found significant reductions in risk of all-cause hospitalization and the number of all-cause length of stay in the intervention group compared to controls. Although HRQoL deteriorated significantly in the intervention group, this may have been due to the poorer HF-functioning at baseline in the intervention group compared to controls. Telehealth medication adherence technologies, such as the MedSentry medication monitoring system, are a promising method to improve patient self-management,the quality of patient care, and reduce health care utilization and expenditure for patients with HF and other chronic diseases that require complex medication regimens.

	abstract = {Objectives: Despite the growing evidence supporting Home-based telebehavioral health (HBTBH) in improving mental health, there has not been an economic analysis comparing it to traditional In-person (IP) setting. The National Center for Telehealth and Technology recently completed a randomized controlled trial comparing the safety and efficacy of HBTBH among U.S. military personnel and Veterans with depression. We performed a trial-based economic analysis comparing HBTBH and IP care for depression. Methods: We performed a cost-minimization analysis on 121 patients with depression to assess the economic impact of HBTBH versus IP behavioral health care from the payer perspective (Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs) at 3 months. Sample population included US service members and veterans with a diagnosis of depression from Joint Base Lewis- McChord (Washington state) and veterans were enrolled from the VA Health Care System (Portland, Oregon). We also performed a scenario analysis assuming that all patients had access to personal video conferencing technology. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model assumptions. Results: In the base-case analysis the total direct cost of HBTBH care was higher than IP care (\$68,483 versus \$21,561). This translates to an \$813 increase per patient. Assuming that patients personally owned computers could be used, HBTBH care was less costly compared to IP care (\$18,242 versus \$21,561). In one-way sensitivity analyses, the proportion of patients using personal computers was a major driver of direct costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis did not differ substantially from the base-case results. Conclusions: Total direct cost of HBTBH care was sensitive to whether patients were able to utilize their personally owned technology. Avoiding the use of government provided computers substantially improves the cost of HBTBH. Health care policies centered on implementation of HBTBH care may benefit from evaluation of technology restrictions among beneficiaries.},

	abstract = {Objective Combat veterans returning to society with impairing mental health conditions such as PTSD and major depression (MD) report significant barriers to care related to aspects of traditional psychotherapy service delivery (e.g., stigma, travel time, and cost). Hence, alternate treatment delivery methods are needed. Home-based telehealth (HBT) is one such option; however, this delivery mode has not been compared to in person, clinic-based care for PTSD in adequately powered trials. The present study was designed to compare relative noninferiority of evidence-based psychotherapies for PTSD and MD, specifically Behavioral Activation and Therapeutic Exposure (BA-TE), when delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic delivery. Method A repeated measures (i.e., baseline, posttreatment, 3-, 6-month follow-up) randomized controlled design powered for noninferiority analyses was used to compare PTSD and MD symptom improvement in response to BA-TE delivered via HBT versus in person, in clinic conditions. Participants were 232 veterans diagnosed with full criteria or predefined subthreshold PTSD. Results PTSD and MD symptom improvement following BA-TE delivered by HBT was comparable to that of BA-TE delivered in person at posttreatment and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. Conclusion Evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD and depression can be safely and effectively delivered via HBT with clinical outcomes paralleling those of clinic-based care delivered in person. HBT, thereby, addresses barriers to care related to both logistics and stigma.},

Results: The pilot study demonstrated an overlapping of the clinical efficacy (Group O2 93\%: 95\% flux l/min, 91\% SaO2 in range, 92\% blood gas analysis T1 in range; Group O2 99\%: 97\% flux l/min, 90\% SaO2, 93\% in range, blood gas analysis T1 in range), an absence of chemical alterations and no interruption of supply measured through a remote monitoring. The new system (costs of installation: 39000€) has produced a saving cost of 15000€, already in the first year, compared to the current 55000€ per year for 18000m3 of O2 99\% and it would produce a saving cost of 50000 € in the following years, as well as an increase in availability of O2 (32000 m3). Conclusions: O2 93\% represents an emerging technology with a clinical and economic impact on the Health Systems with a large-scale saving costs estimated in 20 million euro per year for Piedmont Region only.},

	abstract = {Background: Rationale: Recent trials showed that ambulances equipped with a computed tomography scanner, point-of-care laboratory and telemedicine support (Mobile Stroke Units, MSUs) reduce the onset-to-throm-bolysis time and increase the rate of thrombolysis by 50\%, as compared to usual stroke care. However, those studies were conducted before the demonstration of the benefit of thrombectomy/bridging therapy, and proof of improved long-term outcome after MSU deployment is currently lacking. Besides, whether MSU represents a viable innovation in health-economic dimensions is still uncertain. Methods: Aims: We hypothesized that compared to usual care, the deployment of a MSU would result in an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) {\textless}50,000 euros per QALY in the lifetime horizon. Results: Design: ASPHALT (Acute Stroke: Prehospital versus in-HospitAL initiation of recanalization Therapy) is an academic-driven, multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial of MSU deployment versus standard care, with blinded assessment of efficacy endpoints. Randomization will be performed on an individual patient basis. Three distinct geographic areas in France will be alternatively involved, over 6-month periods. 450 acute ischemic stroke patients (emergency call {\textless}5 hours after onset) will be recruited over a 3-year period, and followed one year. Costs and clinical outcomes including utilities will be collected prospectively during the study period and extrapolated over a lifetime horizon using a Markov model. Conclusions: Study outcomes: The primary endpoint is the ICUR, based on extrapolated results of the mRS and incremental costs at one year. Secondary endpoints include 3-month and 6-month mRS, ICUR at one and five years, proportion of patients undergoing reperfusion therapies, onset-to-treatment and alarm-to-treatment times.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The feasibility of telemedicine in diagnosing and treating nonacute headaches, such as primary headaches (migraine and tension-type) and medication-overuse headaches has not been previously investigated. By eliminating the need of travel to specialists, telemedicine may offer significant time and money savings.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to estimate the acceptance of telemedicine and investigate the feasibility and cost savings of telemedicine consultations in diagnosing and treating nonacute headaches.
METHODS: From September 2012 to March 2015, nonacute headache patients from Northern Norway who were referred to neurologists through an electronic application system were consecutively screened and randomized to participate in either telemedicine or traditional specialist visits. All patients were consulted by two neurologists at the neurological department in Tromsø University Hospital. Feasibility outcomes were compared between telemedicine and traditional groups. Baseline characteristics and costs were then compared between rural and urban patients. Travel costs were calculated by using the probabilistic method of the Norwegian traveling agency: the cheapest means of public transport for each study participant. Loss of pay was calculated based on the Norwegian full-time employee's average salary: {\textless} 3.5 hours=a half day's salary, {\textgreater} 3.5 hours spent on travel and consultation=one day's salary. Distance and time spent on travel were estimated by using Google Maps.
RESULTS: Of 557 headache patients screened, 479 were found eligible and 402 accepted telemedicine participation (83.9\%, 402/479) and were included in the final analyses. Of these, 202 received traditional specialist consultations and 200 received telemedicine. All patients in the telemedicine group were satisfied with the video quality, and 198 (99\%, 198/200) were satisfied with the sound quality. The baseline characteristics as well as headache diagnostics and follow-up appointments, and the investigation, advice, and prescription practices were not statistically different between the two randomized groups. In addition, telemedicine consultations were shorter than traditional visits (38.8 vs 43.7 min, P{\textless}.001). The travel cost per rural individual (292/402, 73\%) was €249, and estimated lost income was €234 per visit. The travel cost in the urban area (110/402, 27\%) was €6, and estimated lost income was €117 per visit. The median traveling distance for rural patients was 526 km (range 1892 km), and the median traveling time was 7.8 hours (range 27.3 hours). Rural patients had a longer waiting time than urban patients (64 vs 47 days, P=.001), and fewer women were referred from rural areas (P=.04). Rural women reported higher pain scores than urban women (P=.005).
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that telemedicine is an accepted, feasible, time-saving, and cost-saving alternative to traditional specialist consultations for nonacute headaches.

	abstract = {Background: Parkinson disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that benefits from specialty care. Telehealth is an innovative resource that can enhance access to this care within a patientcentered framework. Research suggests that telehealth can lead to increased patient satisfaction, equal or better clinical outcomes, and cost savings, but these outcomes have not been well-studied in PD. Methods: We conducted a dual active-arm 12- month randomized controlled trial to assess patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, travel burden, and health care utilization in PD using video telehealth for follow-up care with specialty providers. Telehealth visits took place either at a facility nearer to the patient (satellite clinic arm) or in the patient's home (home arm). Each control group received usual in-person care. Patient satisfaction, assessed by quantitative questionnaires, was the primary outcome. Results: Eighty-six menwere enrolled (home arm: 18 active, 18 control; satellite clinic arm: 26 active, 24 control) with a mean age of 73 years (range 42'87). There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the active group and the controls in each arm (p . 0.05). A significant difference in overall patient satisfaction was not found; however, high levels of patient satisfaction were found in all groups. Greater satisfaction for the telehealth modality was found in assessments of convenience and accessibility/distance. Clinical outcomes were similar between groups, travel burden was reduced using telehealth, and health care utilization was largely similar in both groups. Conclusions: As the need for PD subspecialty care increases, innovative patient-centered solutions to overcoming barriers to access, such as video telehealth, will be invaluable to patients and may provide high patient satisfaction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Action research (AR) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are usually considered to be theoretically and practically incompatible. However, we argue that their respective strengths and weaknesses can be complementary. We illustrate our argument from a recent study assessing the effect of telemonitoring on health-related quality of life, self-care, hospital use, costs and the experiences of patients, informal carers and health care professionals in two urban hospital services and one remote rural primary care service in New Zealand.
METHODS: Data came from authors' observations and field notes of discussions with three groups: the healthcare providers and healthcare consumers who participated in the research, and a group of 17 researchers and collaborators. The consumers had heart failure (Site A, urban), airways disease (Site B, urban), and diabetes (Site C, rural). The research ran from 2008 (project inception) until 2012 (project close-off). Researchers came from a wide range of disciplines. Both RCT and AR methods were recognised from early in the process but often worked in parallel rather than together. In retrospect, we have mapped our observed research processes to the AR cycle characteristics (creation of communicative space, democracy and participation, iterative learning and improvement, emergence, and accommodation of different ways of knowing).
RESULTS: We describe the context, conduct and outcomes of the telemonitoring trial, framing the overall process in the language of AR. Although not fully articulated at the time, AR processes made the RCT sensitive to important context, e.g. clinical processes. They resulted in substantive changes to the design and conduct of the RCT, and to interpretation and uptake of findings, e.g. a simpler technology procurement process emerged. Creating a communicative space enabled co-design between the researcher group and collaborators from the provider participant group, and a stronger RCT design.
CONCLUSIONS: It appears possible to enhance the utility of RCTs by explicitly embedding them in an AR framework to shape stronger RCT design. The AR process and characteristics may enable researchers to evaluate telehealth while enhancing rather than compromising the quality of an RCT, where research results are returned to practice as part of the research process.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested whether a self-motivated, complex eHealth intervention could improve multiple health-related behaviors that are associated with cognitive aging among working Dutch adults.
METHODS: This quasi-experimental prospective study with a pre-post design was conducted with employees of Dutch medium to large companies. All employees with Internet access, a good understanding of the Dutch language, and who provided digital informed consent were eligible to participate. In total, 2972 participants (2110/2972, 71.11\% females) with a mean (standard deviation, SD) age of 51.8 (SD 12.9) years were recruited; 2305 became active users of the intervention, and 173 completed the 1-year follow-up. This self-motivated eHealth lifestyle intervention stimulates participants to set personally relevant, monthly health behavior change goals using Goal Attainment Scaling and to realize these goals by implementing behavior change techniques grounded in behavior change theory. The primary outcomes were the goal-setting success rate and the change in overall lifestyle score from baseline to the 1-year follow-up; the score was based on physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol, sleep, and stress scores. The secondary outcomes were the changes in body weight, body mass index, specific lifestyle characteristics, and website usage.
RESULTS: A total of 1212 participants set 2620 behavior change goals; 392 participants assessed 1089 (1089/2288, 47.59\%) goals and successfully achieved 422 (422/1089, 38.75\%) of these goals. Among the goal-setting participants in follow-up, this led to a +0.81-point improvement (95\% CI 0.49-1.13, P{\textless}.001) in overall lifestyle (d=0.32) and weight loss of 0.62 kg (95\% CI -1.16 to -0.07, P=.03). These participants also showed significant improvement in 8 out of 11 specific lifestyle components.
CONCLUSIONS: Among an adult Dutch population, this eHealth intervention resulted in lifestyle changes in behavioral risk factors associated with cognitive decline, and these improvements lasted over the period of 1 year. Given the general aging of our workforce, this eHealth intervention opens new avenues for the widespread use of cost-effective self-motivated prevention programs aimed at prevention of early-stage cognitive decline and more self-management of their risk factors.

	abstract = {Background and Rationale: With limited specialist physicians available in regional hospitals, telemedicine may help improve access to time critical acute stroke treatments. The Victorian Stroke Telemedicine (VST) project is being established in 16 regional hospitals across Victoria, Australia (Bladin et al., 2015). This program enables access to neurologists at any time for decision support related to reperfusion therapies. We present preliminary data on whether the VST program is cost-effective. Methods: Patients presenting to a participating hospital with suspected stroke {\textless}4.5 hours from symptom onset were eligible using 2011-2012 administrative data for Victoria. A simulated, incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to assess the potential costs and benefits of the VST program compared with (a) usual care or (b) an alternate 'counterfactual' option of directly employing stroke specialists to service one or more regional hospitals for delivering reperfusion therapy to patients in regional Victorian hospitals. Interim data from the VST program and the literature were sourced to populate the economic model. Assumptions were verified by an expert working group. Incremental costs were compared to incremental benefits measured as 'healthy years (HY)' gained. Scenario modelling and sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for uncertainty in the point estimates. Results: Using a willingness-to-pay threshold of AUD50,000/ HY gained, the VST program was cost-effective compared to usual care (net cost per HY gained AUD38,000; 95\% uncertainty in terval [UI] AUD22,000, AUD60,000) with ∼66 more patients being treated with intravenous thrombolysis. The counterfactual scenario of employing stroke specialists at regional hospitals was not cost-effective (AUD73,000 [95\% UI AUD42,000, AUD118,000; 9\% iterations {\textless}\$50,000] per HY gained). Conclusion: Stroke telemedicine is a feasible model to improve stroke outcomes in rural and regional areas. Our preliminary, economic evaluation of the VST program provides important information to guide the business case for ongoing sustainability and funding of the program.},

	abstract = {Background Unintended rehospitalizations after surgical procedures represent a large percentage of readmissions and have been associated with increased morbidity and cost of care. Beginning in 2017, Medicare will expand diagnostic categories subject to financial penalties for excess postoperative readmissions to include coronary revascularization procedures. Arrhythmias and pulmonary complications comprise the largest categories for readmission after cardiac surgery. Technologic advances in remote monitoring have led to the use of web-based digital health kits (DHK) aimed at reducing readmissions and improving postoperative outcomes. The present study was performed to determine the added benefit of incorporating DHK's into a formal readmissions reduction program (RRP) in preventing 30-d readmissions and to evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the use of these devices. Materials and methods This was a prospective study of all adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution from March 2014 to June 2015. During the study period, 443 adult patients (mean age, 65 ± 14, 33\% female) were identified and participated in the formal RRP, 27 of whom also received a DHK after discharge (416 control group). In addition to providing a live video link to a provider specializing in cardiac surgery, the DHK also allowed for automatic daily transmission of weight, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure. Patients also completed a daily health survey targeting symptoms concerning for heart failure, poor wound healing, poor ambulation, and nonadherence to medications. Abnormal vitals or survey responses triggered automatic notifications to the healthcare team. Satisfaction surveys were administered to participants and members of the healthcare team. Pearson χ2 test and the Welch's t-test were used to assess statistical differences in baseline characteristics and outcome variables. Results During the study period, the readmission rate for the DHK and control groups were similar (7.4\% versus 9.9\%, P = 0.65). The use of DHKs led to 1649 alerts and 144 interventions, with the highest number of alerts occurring during d 5-9. The majority of alerts (64\%) were prompted by abnormal biometric measurements, and a significant correlation was noted between abnormal biometrics and required intervention (r = 0.62, P {\textless} 0.001). No correlation was seen between alerts because of health survey responses (r = 0.07, P = 0.71) or missed check-ins (r = 0.06, P = 0.76) and required interventions. Poststudy satisfaction surveys showed an overall satisfaction rating of 4.9 ± 0.5 for DHK patients and 4.9 ± 0.2 for members of the care team (scale 1-5, 5 = agree). Conclusions In our study, adding DHKs to a formal RRP was not associated with a significant decrease in 30-d readmission rates. We also found that notifications because of abnormal biometric measures were significantly correlated with required interventions. In contrast, notifications due to abnormal health survey responses were not associated with increased interventions. Both patients and members of the healthcare team were highly satisfied with this technology. DHKs appear to extend care beyond the inpatient period and provide a portal for telemonitoring of surgical patients. However, this modality is highly resource intensive and may not significantly reduce readmissions. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of such kits in reducing readmissions and costs of care.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 178 eligible patients with HF were randomized to either structured follow-up on the basis of face-to-face encounters (control group, 97 patients) or delivering health care using telemedicine (81 patients). Telemedicine included daily signs and symptoms based on telemonitoring and structured follow-up by means of video or audio-conference. The primary end-point was non-fatal HF events after six months of follow-up. The median age of the patients was 77 years, 41\% were female, and 25\% were frail patients. The hazard ratio for the primary end-point was 0.35 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-0.59; p-value {\textless} 0.001) in favour of telemedicine. HF readmission (hazard ratio 0.39 (0.19-0.77); p-value=0.007) and cardiovascular readmission (hazard ratio 0.43 (0.23-0.80); p-value=0.008) were also reduced in the telemedicine group. Mortality was similar in both groups (telemedicine: 6.2\% vs control: 12.4\%, p-value {\textgreater} 0.05). The telemedicine group experienced a significant mean net reduction in direct hospital costs of €3546 per patient per six months of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients managed in the setting of a comprehensive HF programme, the addition of telemedicine may result in better outcomes and reduction of costs.},

	abstract = {Abstract text The need for serial vaginal sonograms to monitor ovarian stimulation for artificial reproductive technology (ART) treatments remains a cause for stress and sometimes a major practical challenge both for patients and health care providers. It hampers access to treatment for many couples seeking ART treatment or renders it strenuous from an organizational point of view. It creates a hidden cost when people have to travel frequently to have sonograms made or have to plan a hotel stay near the centre where oocyte retrieval and IVF embryology work take place. We have been exploring over the past couple of years the possibilities of a method (Self-Operated Endo-vaginal Tele-monitoring, SOET) allowing patients and/or their partners to make vaginal sonograms themselves at home or in fact anywhere and anytime if WiFi is available. Specific cloud-based communication software has been developed that can be installed on any notebook or tablet PC. If applicable, midwives, nurses or other health care providers such as general practitioners working independently from highly specialized services, can also perform these recordings. Current experience includes results from a published randomized trial (Hum. Reprod. 2014) comparing SOET with traditional monitoring as well as from a subsequent series of one hundred consecutive ART cycles where patients used SOET instead of traditional monitoring to monitor the stimulation phase. Clinical, laboratory and patient reported outcome data as well as health economic data show that after some initial teaching motivated patients are sufficiently prepared and competent to make and send adequate video recordings to the centre or to the physician following them up. The interpretation of these recordings does not lead to different clinical decisions than when made on-site using high-end machines. On-site back-up remains always possible if there is a need to confirm unexpected results. This was the case is just 1\% of patients. Laboratory and clinical results are similar to those obtained with traditional monitoring and patients are very satisfied with SOET. They can make sonograms discretely where and when it suits them best. Receipt of images and of responses is acknowledged by SMS. After measurement of the growing follicles, a structured response is sent to the patient, comprising dosing advice and next-step instructions. This facilitates the follow-up of ovarian stimulation, even if applicable initially to just a selected proportion of IVF patients. It can fit into the general tendency to make IVF more patient-centred and -friendly, to implement tele-medicine and increase patient empowerment and partner participation by supervised active participation to their treatment. It opens up access to treatment for patients who live far from IVF centres and widens the scope of patient recruitment for centers. If combined with point of care determinations of estradiol to monitor patients at risk for OHSS, SOET may acquire a place in ART although the most recent Cochrane meta-analysis concludes that systematic E2 measurements do not increase pregnancy rates nor decrease the incidence of OHSS. Impediments for implementation of this technology are disruption of the comfort zone of doctors, the novelty of the technology and financial considerations. SOET is not just a tool, but a disruptive change of practice where the patient and her partner are playing a central and active role in their treatment.},

	abstract = {Background Traditionally, when a patient treated for a severe exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure (HF) at a Swedish hospital, the patient is then discharged to primary care. Mostly, it relies upon the patient to contact the primary care centre for necessary follow-up visits. Because of the lack of follow-up, the risk of hospital readmissions due to a new exacerbation is high. In order to break the vicious cycle of exacerbation, hospital admission, re-exacerbation and re-hospitalization we therefore reorganised the care by letting a specialised home care (SHC) clinic, supported by a telehealth system, be responsible for the care of these patients instead of discharging the patients to primary care. The study will evaluate if the re-organisation and system can contribute to earlier detection of patients' deterioration and prevention of acute hospital admission, costs, and differences between COPD and HF patients. Methods A 4 year (2013-2017) telehealth intervention non-randomized single- centre clinical study, compared with expected outcomes, was set up. Elderly, multi-morbid patients with COPD or HF exacerbations are admitted to specialised home care and tele-monitored by a multi-professional team at the SHC clinic. Patients included in the study have had at least two hospital admissions during the year preceding inclusion and planned study participation for twelve months. The patients report daily to the clinic on performed physiological measurements (e.g. saturation, weight, blood pressure), symptom assessments (breathlessness, cough, phlegm) and intake of p.r.n. (''as needed'') medication. The care providers use a web-based system, the Health Diary, to view patients' reports for the detection of early signs of deterioration. The system generates alarms if the reported measurements or symptoms are below/above the individually decided thresholds and also if a patient misses the daily report. Meeting the patients' low digital literacy we developed the telehealth system based on digital pen technology. This way the patients do not have to learn how to use a tablet/smartphone or computer; they only have to be able to write with the digital ink pen. Earlier studies have shown digital pen technology to be suitable for elderly, multi-morbid patients [1]. Exacerbations are identified using information provided through the Health Diary system and the EHR. Consumed health care is assessed as the number of patient-care provider contacts (home visits or telephone consultations by a nurse or physician). Result Presently (February 2016), 72 patients with advanced disease are enrolled (27 COPD and 45 HF patients) of which 22 patients (9 COPD and 13 HF patients) have completed the 1-year study period or have died during the study period (8 COPD and 11 HF patients). Exacerbations were 2.4 and 0.8 and patient contacts were 85 and 53 per COPD and HF patient, respectively. While HF patients were significantly older than COPD patients, the two groups demonstrated no difference regarding gender distribution. Conclusion COPD patients exhibit exacerbations more frequently and demand much more home health care than patients with HF do. It seems that this difference of health care consumption is mainly due to disease characteristics.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a telehealth intervention for primary care patients with raised cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Design: A prospective within-trial patient-level economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial. Setting: Patients recruited through primary care, and intervention delivered via telehealth service. Participants: Adults with a 10-year CVD risk ≥20\%, as measured by the QRISK2 algorithm, with at least 1 modifiable risk factor. Intervention: A series of up to 13 scripted, theory-led telehealth encounters with healthcare advisors, who supported participants to make behaviour change, use online resources, optimise medication and improve adherence. Participants in the control arm received usual care. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Cost-effectiveness measured by net monetary benefit at the end of 12 months of follow-up, calculated from incremental cost and incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Productivity impacts, participant out-ofpocket expenditure and the clinical outcome were presented in a cost-consequences framework. Results: 641 participants were randomised¡325 to receive the telehealth intervention in addition to usual care and 316 to receive only usual care. 18\% of participants had missing data on either costs, utilities or both. Multiple imputation was used for the base case results. The intervention was associated with incremental mean per-patient National Health Service (NHS) costs of σ138 (95\% CI 66 to 211) and an incremental QALY gain of 0.012 (95\% CI.0.001 to 0.026). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was σ10 859. Net monetary benefit at a cost-effectiveness threshold of σ20 000 per QALY was σ116 (95\% CI.58 to 291), and the probability that the intervention was cost-effective at this threshold value was 0.77. Similar results were obtained from a complete case analysis. Conclusions: There is evidence to suggest that the Healthlines telehealth intervention was likely to be costeffective at a threshold of σ20 000 per QALY.},

	abstract = {Telemedicine applications are increasingly being introduced in patient care in various disciplines, including clinical genetics, mainly to increase access to care and to reduce time and costs for patients and professionals. Most telegenetics reports describe applications in large geographical areas, showing positive patients' and professionals' satisfaction. One economic analysis published thus far reported lower costs than in-person care. We hypothesized that telegenetics can also be beneficial from the professional's view in relatively small geographical areas. We performed a pilot study in the Northern Netherlands of 51 home-based online counseling sessions for cardiogenetic and oncogenetic cascade screening, and urgent prenatal counseling. Previously, we showed patient satisfaction, anxiety, and perceived control of online counseling to be comparable to in-person counseling. This study focuses on expectations, satisfaction, and practical evaluations of the involved counselors, and the impact in terms of time and costs. Most counselors expected disadvantages of online counseling for themselves and their patients, mainly concerning insufficient non-verbal communication; few expected advantages for themselves. Afterwards, counselors additionally raised the disadvantage of insufficient verbal communication, and reported frequent technical problems. Their overall mean telemedicine satisfaction itemscore was 3.38 before, and 2.95 afterwards, being afterwards slightly below the minimum level we set for a satisfactory result. We estimated reduced time and costs by online counseling with about 8\% and 10-12\%, respectively. We showed online genetic counseling to be effective, feasible and cost-efficient, but technical improvements are needed to increase counselors' satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: The increased use of the internet is changing the way health care providers and the general population can interact. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease with special needs related to achieve good metabolic control in order to avoid the development of chronic complications. To achieve this goal, telematics systems (TS) may be useful. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and satisfaction of patients with a telematics system based on an online platform. Materials and methods: This is a pilot, multicentre, randomized, monitored non-PAS study including 49 Type 2 diabetic patients (18 to 65 years old) receiving insulin treatment. The study consisted of two cohorts: Standard Management Arm (SM): 25 patients following routine clinical practice and Comprehensive Management Arm (CM): 24 patients monitored through comprehensive clinical care between Primary Healthcare and Specialized Healthcare, supported by telemedicine tools. Patients on CM sent information about glycaemia and insulin dose monthly through the TS and doctors made adjustment of treatment according to glycaemia values. Efficacy was measured in terms of HbA1c, number of episodes of hyper and hypoglycaemia. A satisfaction survey was completed by the patients before and at the end of the study. Costs were also analysed. Results: HbA1c improved in 57,9\%of patients on CMvs 54,55\%on SM (p value {\textgreater}0,05) over a median of 6 months follow-up duration. Symptomatic hypoglycaemic and especially nocturnal episodes showed better evolution in CM group although we did not found statistically significant differences related to the small size of the sample. Patients onCMshowed an improvement in satisfaction with the use of TS according to the comfort in the use of this technology (7, 6 vs 8, 7 p value =0, 04) at the end of the study. At the end of the 6-month Study, there were 68 onsite consultations less in the CM arm versus SMarm, representing savings of €3,672. Conclusion: Results found in this study suggest that CMintervention can lead to improvement in glycaemic control and self-management in diabetes care. Telematics systems can help to diminish health care resources use and this can contribute to a reduction in economic costs although we have to consider the short time of the follow up period. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the economic impact of these strategies on Diabetes Care.},

	abstract = {Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an effective intervention for the management of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, available resources are often limited, and many patients bear with poor availability of programmes. Sustaining PR benefits and regular exercise over the long term is difficult without any exercise maintenance strategy. In contrast to traditional centre-based PR programmes, telerehabilitation may promote more effective integration of exercise routines into daily life over the longer term and broaden its applicability and availability. A few studies showed promising results for telerehabilitation, but mostly with short-term interventions. The aim of this study is to compare long-term telerehabilitation with unsupervised exercise training at home and with standard care. Methods/Design: An international multicentre randomised controlled trial conducted across sites in three countries will recruit 120 patients with COPD. Participants will be randomly assigned to telerehabilitation, treadmill and control, and followed up for 2 years. The telerehabilitation intervention consists of individualised exercise training at home on a treadmill, telemonitoring by a physiotherapist via videoconferencing using a tablet computer, and self-management via a customised website. Patients in the treadmill arm are provided with a treadmill only to perform unsupervised exercise training at home. Patients in the control arm are offered standard care. The primary outcome is the combined number of hospitalisations and emergency department presentations. Secondary outcomes include changes in health status, quality of life, anxiety and depression, self-efficacy, subjective impression of change, physical performance, level of physical activity, and personal experiences in telerehabilitation. Discussion: This trial will provide evidence on whether long-term telerehabilitation represents a cost-effective strategy for the follow-up of patients with COPD. The delivery of telerehabilitation services will also broaden the availability of PR and maintenance strategies, especially to those living in remote areas and with no access to centre-based exercise programmes.

However, these veterans underutilize smoking cessation treatment, which suggests that interventions for rural veterans should optimize efficacy and reach. Objective The primary goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention that combines evidenced based treatment for smoking cessation with smart-phone based, portable contingency management on smoking rates compared to a contact control intervention in a randomized controlled trial among rural Veteran smokers. Specifically, Veterans will be randomized to receive Abstinence Reinforcement Therapy (ART) which combines evidenced based cognitive-behavioral telephone counseling (TC), a tele-medicine clinic for access to nicotine replacement (NRT), and mobile contingency management (mCM) or a control condition (i.e., TC and NRT alone) that will provide controls for therapist, medication, time and attention effects. Methods Smokers were identified using VHA electronic medical records and recruited proactively via telephone. Participants (N = 310) are randomized to either ART or a best practice control consisting of telephone counseling and telemedicine. Participating patients will be surveyed at 3-months, 6-months and 12-months post-randomization. The primary outcome measure is self-reported and biochemically validated prolonged abstinence at 6-month follow-up. Discussion This trial is designed to test the relative effectiveness of ART compared to a telehealth-only comparison group. Dissemination of this mHealth intervention for veterans in a variety of settings would be warranted if ART improves smoking outcomes for rural veterans and is cost-effective.},

	abstract = {Background: Telemedicine, the provision of healthcare using an audio-visual connection, is increasingly used to enhance access to medical care for patients with geographic or mobility limitations. The virtual house call-conducting a clinical visit remotely with a patient located at home-has been used successfully in other neurologic disorders but has not been systematically assessed in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Goals: 1) Assess feasibility and satisfaction of virtual house calls for MS patients. 2) Determine differences in cost and visit duration between telemedicine and in-person visits. Methods: MS patients of a university-affiliated clinic were recruited to participate in two follow-up visits with their treating neurologists, at three and six months after the baseline visit. Randomisation determined which type of visit occurred first for each subject (MS clinic versus virtual house call). Subjects completed surveys providing demographics, MS-related information and opinions on both types of clinical encounter. Feasibility was determined using the percentage of each visit type completed within the scheduled time window. Key questions on subjectcompleted surveys were used to determine subject's satisfaction, time spent, and costs. Results: 42 subjects were randomised, 37 of whom completed both the in-person and virtual house call visits. Twenty-five of the 37 (67.6\%) telemedicine visits were completed within the specified time frame as compared with 28 of the 38 (73.7\%) inperson visits (difference 6.1\%, p=0.75). Nearly all subjects (97.1\%) reported that they would recommend virtual house call visits to a peer, similar to 97.4\% of subjects who would recommend an in-person visit. A telemedicine visit saved subjects an average of \$55 as compared with an in-person visit. An in-person visit required an average of 92 minutes longer to complete compared with a telemedicine visit while a significantly greater percentage of the telemedicine visit was spent with the physician (79.0\% vs 25.7\%, p{\textless} 0.01). Subjects' unscripted survey comments expressed satisfaction with the virtual house calls, with frequently mentioned themes of convenience and equivalence with in-person visits. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that virtual house calls are feasible and well-liked by a sample of MS patients. The cost effectiveness and time-savings make this form of telemedicine an attractive method for increasing access to neurologic care for MS patients.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a prevalent disease with significant morbidity resulting in long waiting lists and high health care costs. Therefore, alternative cost-effective approaches are urgently needed. A possible procedure is telemedicine based on ICT. Objectives: The primary objective was implementing an ICT-based out-of-hospital management of OSA to be compared with the classical in-hospital management. Other aims were: procedure cost-effectiveness, compliance, patient satisfaction and clinical and physiological improvement. Methods: We set a 3-month randomized study with parallel groups for inclusion of a total of 168 patients with suspicion of OSA derived to our Sleep Unit. Exclusion criteria are subjects unable to use Smartphone, unstable diseases or severe hypersomnia. Patients are randomized in two groups; 1) classical in-hospital group: polysomnograph, respiratory polygraphy (RP) or home respiratory polygraphy (HRP), CPAP titration and treatment and hospital follow-up; and 2) ICT group: 3 consecutive HRPs, automatic CPAP treatment and control by phono/video conferences and data transmission by using a custom designed platform. Results: The feasibility and satisfaction of the physicians/patients in the first 17 patients (Age: 48,9±14yr, ESS: 10,9±5, AHI: 17,8±9) was good. One out of the 9 ICT group patients dropped out at follow-up. Conclusions: This initial trial data suggest that the ICT strategy will contribute to development of costeffective procedures for OSA management, with patients and physicians satisfaction.

	abstract = {Objective: Blood pressure telemonitoring with remote counseling (BPTM) represents a useful tool for effective management of hypertension (HTN). Unfortunately, the evidence provided by recent studies on economic benefits of this approach is incomplete. The aim of this research was to compare the costs and cost-effectiveness of telemedicine-based intervention and standard care in hypertensive patients. Design and method: The study enrolled 80 patients aged 18-85 (median 53 years old) with uncontrolled HTN. The subjects were randomized to gender, age and baseline BP - matched groups: BPTM group (n = 50) and usual care (n = 30) with clinic visits. Duration of follow-up constituted 3 months. Economic evaluation consisted of total healthcare costs calculation both for BPTM and usual care settled in Euro currency. Cost of illness (COI), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) assessment along with cost-utility analysis (CUA) with the use of Short Form-36 (SF-36) were performed. Results: BPTM group had significantly larger decrease of systolic BP compared to standard care (-16 ± 6 mmHg; p = 0,04) while the number of antihypertensive drugs in BPTM remained unchanged (+0,3 drugs; p = 0,15). COI was 2.36 times higher in BPTM than in usual care (196.9 € vs. 83.5€; p {\textless} 0.005). An ICER was 8.45 €/mmHg (95\% CI 4.9 € to 12 €) per patient. BPTM improved quality of life (+2.9 for physical component SF-36; p = 0.04) with 0,06 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient. The resultant CUA for BPTM was 2698 € per QALY for patient which is also cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20383 € per QALY gained. Extrapolating target BP holdover effect to a ten-year period, a cost-benefit analysis showed that BPTM is more cost-saving than usual care approach (-672.5 € per patient). Conclusions: Blood pressure telemonitoring with remote counseling facilitate achievement of target blood pressure level in a cost-effective and cost-saving way. The management costs will be compensated by potential prevention of future expenses for complications.},

The CellScope iPhone Otoscope allows parents to record their children's ear examinations and send the films for remote physician diagnosis. This study determines the reliability of an otolaryngologist's diagnosis by video as compared with pneumatic otoscopy when videos are taken by parents on an iPhone otoscope versus videos taken by a physician. Study Design and Setting: Prospective randomized blinded trial. Setting: Tertiary academic children's hospital. Methods: Parents of children ages 1 month to 17 years attempted recordings of the tympanic membrane of their children with the CellScope, and a physician subsequently used the device to record the same ear as well prior to office visits between September 2015 and December 2015. Later, a pediatric otolaryngologist attempted diagnosis solely based on the videos, blinded to whether the examination was filmed by a parent or physician. Interrater reliability between video diagnosis and original diagnosis on pneumatic otoscopy was measured and objective tympanic membrane landmarks visualized on the films were recorded. Results: Eighty ears were enrolled and recorded. There was moderate interrater agreement (k = 0.42) between diagnosis based on parent films as compared with pneumatic otoscopy. There was substantial agreement (k = 0.71) between diagnosis based on physician films and pneumatic otoscopy. Physician videos and parent videos had only slight agreement on objective landmarks identified (k = 0.087). Conclusions: iPhone otoscopy provides reliable cost-effective tele-otoscopy images in the hands of physicians, but improvement is needed for reliable parent use.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Decentralised services using outreach clinics or modern technology are methods to reduce both patient transports and costs to the healthcare system. Telemedicine consultations via videoconference are one such modality. Before new technologies are implemented, it is important to investigate both the quality of care given and the economic impact from the use of this new technology. The aim of this clinical trial was to study the quality of planned remote orthopaedic consultations by help of videoconference.
METHOD: We performed a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel groups: video-assisted remote consultations at a regional medical centre (RMC) as an intervention versus standard consultation in the orthopaedic outpatient clinic at the University Hospital of North Norway (UNN) as a control. The participants were patients referred to or scheduled for a consultation at the orthopaedic outpatient clinic. The orthopaedic surgeons evaluated each consultation they performed by completing a questionnaire. The primary outcome measurement was the difference in the sum score calculated from this questionnaire, which was evaluated by the non-inferiority of the intervention group. The study design was based on the intention to treat principle. Ancillary analyses regarding complications, the number of consultations per patient, operations, patients who were referred again and the duration of consultations were performed.
RESULTS: Four-hundred patients were web-based randomised. Of these, 199 (98 \%) underwent remote consultation and 190 (95 \%) underwent standard consultation. The primary outcome, the sum score of the specialist evaluation, was significantly lower (i.e. 'better') at UNN compared to RMC (1.72 versus 1.82, p = 0.0030). The 90 \% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in score (0.05, 0.17) was within the non-inferiority margin. The orthopaedic surgeons involved evaluated 98 \% of the video-assisted consultations as 'good' or 'very good'. In the ancillary analyses, there was no significant difference between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the argument that it is safe to offer video-assisted consultations for selected orthopaedic patients. We did not find any serious events related to the mode of consultation. Further assessments of the economic aspects and patient satisfaction are needed before we can recommend its wider application.

	abstract = {Background The use of point-of-care ultrasonography (POC US) in paediatrics is increasing. This study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of POC US in children accessing the emergency department (ED) when performed by paediatricians under the remote guidance of radiologists (TELE POC). Methods Children aged 0 to 18 years accessing the ED of a third level research hospital with eight possible clinical scenarios and without emergency/severity signs at the triage underwent three subsequent US tests: by a paediatrician guided remotely by a radiologist (TELE POC); by the same radiologist (UNBLIND RAD); by an independent blinded radiologist (BLIND RAD). Tele-radiology was implemented using low cost "commercial off-the-shelf" (COTS) equipment and open-source software. Data were prospectively collected on predefined templates. Results Fifty-two children were enrolled, for a total of 170 ultrasound findings. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of TELE POC were: 93.8, 99.7, 96.8, 99.4 when compared to UNBLIND RAD and 88.2, 99.7, 96.8, 98.7 when compared to BLIND RAD. The inter-observers agreement between the paediatricians and either the unblind or blind radiologist was excellent (k = 0.93). The mean duration of TELE POC was 6.3 minutes (95\% CI 4.1 to 8.5). Technical difficulties occurred in two (3.8\%) cases. Quality of the transmission was rated as fair, good, very good and excellent in 7.7\%, 15.4\%, 42.3\% and 34.6\% of cases respectively, while in no case was it rated as poor. Conclusions POC US performed by paediatricians in ED guided via tele-radiology by an expert radiologist (TELE POC) produced reliable and timely diagnoses. Findings of this study, especially for the rarer conditions under evaluation, need further confirmation. Future research should investigate the overall benefits and the cost savings of using tele-ultrasound to perform US "at children's bedsides", under remote guidance of expert radiologists.},

	abstract = {Introduction The primary objective of this project was to examine the effectiveness of an Internet-based smoking cessation intervention combined with a tele-health medication clinic for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) compared to referral to clinic-based smoking cessation care. Methods A total of 413 patients were proactively recruited from the Durham VA Medical Center and followed for 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive either a referral to VA specialty smoking cessation care (control) or to the Internet intervention and tele-health medication clinic. Primary outcomes included (1) intervention reach, (2) self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates at 3 months and 12 months, and 3) relative cost-effectiveness. Results Reach of the Internet intervention and use of smoking cessation aids were significantly greater compared to the control. At 3 months-post randomization, however, there were no significant differences in quit rates: 17\% (95\% CI: 12\%–23\%) in the Internet-based intervention compared to 12\% (95\% CI: 8\%–17\%) in the control arm. Similarly, there were no differences in quit rates at 12 months (13\% vs. 16\%). While costs associated with the Internet arm were higher due to increased penetration and intensity of NRT use, there were no statistically significant differences in the relative cost effectiveness (e.g., life years gained, quality adjusted life years) between the two arms. Conclusions Current results suggest that using an electronic medical record to identify smokers and proactively offering smoking cessation services that are consistent with US Public Health Guidelines can significantly reduce smoking in veterans. Novel interventions that increase the reach of intensive treatment are needed to maximize quit rates in this population.},

	abstract = {Background: In radiotherapy, precise targeting is required to kill cancer cells and minimize impact on healthy cells. The dose delivered by radiation treatment machines is audited by independent organizations. Conventional audits are performed through site visits or mailing dosimeters to the centers, involving either high cost or increased measurement uncertainties. Aim: This study lays the foundation for remotely auditing of radiotherapy machines. Using center images from readily available electronic imagers, it measures central pixel value (CPV) and gravitational sag of the imager and. It then models delivered dose. Method: Images of eight centers were used in this pilot study. CPV: Two 10 × 10 cm2 images with different collimator angles were used to determine CPV. Values of 50\% points of each image width were calculated using linear interpolation and then, they were normalized to approximate CPV. Mean value of the points was considered as CPV. Sag: 10 × 10 images acquired at every 45° gantry angle were employed to model sag values. CPV of 0° image was calculated and compared with CPV of images acquired at other angles. The difference versus gantry angle showed best fit with first order of Fourier series. Finally, the corrections are used to model complex delivered dose distributions. Results: CPV and sag were modeled for each center. Sag parameters were identified with 99.2\% (SD: 0.94\%) mean R-square fitting over the centers. Applying the corrections, delivered open field doses were modeled with mean isocenter dose discrepancy of 0.04\% (SD: 0.11\%). Conclusion: The characterization method could be consistently applied to all centers. The remote audit approach is inexpensive and fast. It is feasible since all radiotherapy machines are equipped with similar imagers. Translational research aspect: This project falls into the T1-T2 translational pipeline. Fundamental research on imagers resulted in a novel application for remote assessment of treatment delivery at various centers.},

	abstract = {Background: Virtual monitoring is emerging as an alternative model for health care delivery to optimise usage of limited resources. However, nurse-led telemonitoring (NLT) as a complement to current models of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) care have not been examined yet. Aims: To examine the safety, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of NLT as a complement to CHB standard care. Methods: This is an ongoing two-arm randomised controlled trial with a follow up duration of 2 years. One group received standard care (SC) and the other received standard care alternating with nurse-led virtual hepatitis B monitoring service (NHMS). In the NHMS group, trained nurse-clinicians monitored and communicated patient blood test results by phone. Safety was assessed by incidence rate of LC, HCC, and raised ALT requiring medications (ALTm) and failure to detect these clinical events. Feasibility was assessed by patient compliance with CHB monitoring, patient experience and acceptance of this model of care. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by changes in transport cost, waiting time and days of sick leave for CHB care. Data were obtained from electronic health records and administered questionnaires. Results: 333 clinically stable CHB patients were recruited (mean±SD age: 56.1±12.8 years; Females: 54.9\%; Chinese: 97.9\%), of whom 121 (36.3\%) have completed the follow-up. Baseline mean±SD of ALT, Albumin and AFP were 23.83±10.37IU/mL, 42.40±2.75g/L and 2.73±1.82ng/mL respectively. Among patients who completed the follow-up, no significant differences were observed in the incidence rates of LC, HCC and ALTm between both arms (1.7\% vs 2.1\%; 1.7\% vs 0.0\%; 5.0\% vs 5.9\% respectively, all p=1.000). All clinical events were detected during clinical or virtual visit. Statistically significant (p{\textless}0.05) differences were observed in the change of total transport costs and waiting time in the NHMS group compared to SC (median -S\$3.04 vs S\$0.40, -120 minutes vs -45 minutes respectively. No significant difference (p{\textgreater}0.05) was seen in compliance with CHB-related appointments and the number of sick leave days taken for CHB care between both arms (both median 100.00\% and 0.00 days respectively). 82.6\% of the patients in the NHMS group opined that NHMS was better than SC and 85.2\% would prefer the NHMS model of care if given a choice. Conclusion: The data suggests that specialist care alternating with telemonitoring by nurse-clinicians for stable CHB patients is a safe, feasible and cost-effective complement to standard care as it significantly reduces transportation costs and waiting time while maintaining the level of patient safety and optimising specialist care resources.},

	abstract = {Objectives: In-ambulance telemedicine for stroke patients is a promising new approach to speed up treatment and improve patient outcome. Literature data prove that faster stroke treatment leads to better patient outcome and that in-ambulance telemedicine is safe, feasible and reliable. A cost-utility model can provide more objective information on the costs and benefits associated with this new telemedi cine treatment. Methods: Current standard stroke care is compared with current standard stroke care including in-ambulance telemedicine, applying a cost-utility model measuring costs and QALY's from a societal perspective. We combine a decision tree model with a Markov model, using a lifetime horizon. Data from the Stroke Registry UZ Brussel (2.282 stroke patients) and linked hospital claims data at individual level are combined with findings from literature to populate the model. The effects of in-ambulance telemedicine are modeled assuming an average decrease of 30 minutes in the initiation of treatment. This results in a higher proportion of patients fitting the time window for thrombolysis and a higher proportion of endovascular treatments compared to standard stroke care. Additionally chances of positive outcome increase, since more patients are treated in an earlier timewindow. The cost-effectiveness threshold was defined at € 35.000/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis are applied, using Monte Carlo simulations with 5.000 bootstraps to account for the uncertainty around the input parameters. Results: Taking a lifetime horizon into account, in-ambulance telemedicine is a dominant strategy, decreasing costs by € 709 per stroke patient and resulting in 0,027 QALY's gained per patient. In 93\% of all probabilistic simulations in-ambulance telemedicine remains under the cost-effectiveness threshold. Conclusions: In-ambulance telemedicine seems to be highly cost-effective from a societal perspective. To further validate this model, data from randomized clinical trials on time to treatment initiation and patient outcome are needed.},

This study examines the reliability, accuracy, and precision of the poisoned patient assessment when performed remotely via Google Glass®. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study was performed on 50 patients admitted to a tertiary care center inpatient toxicology service. Toxicology fellows wore Google Glass® and transmitted secure, real-time video and audio of the initial physical examination to a remote investigator not involved in the subject’s care. High-resolution still photos of electrocardiograms (ECGs) were transmitted to the remote investigator. On-site and remote investigators recorded physical examination findings and ECG interpretation. Both investigators completed a brief survey about the acceptability and reliability of the streaming technology for each encounter. Kappa scores and simple agreement were calculated for each examination finding and electrocardiogram parameter. Reliability scores and reliability difference were calculated and compared for each encounter. Results: Data were available for analysis of 17 categories of examination and ECG findings. Simple agreement between on-site and remote investigators ranged from 68 to 100 \% (median = 94 \%, IQR = 10.5). Kappa scores could be calculated for 11/17 parameters and demonstrated slight to fair agreement for two parameters and moderate to almost perfect agreement for nine parameters (median = 0.653; substantial agreement). The lowest Kappa scores were for pupil size and response to light. On a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), mean comfort level was 93 and mean reliability rating was 89 for on-site investigators. For remote users, the mean comfort and reliability ratings were 99 and 86, respectively. The average difference in reliability scores between on-site and remote investigators was 2.6, with the difference increasing as reliability scores decreased. Conclusion: Remote evaluation of poisoned patients via Google Glass® is possible with a high degree of agreement on examination findings and ECG interpretation. Evaluation of pupil size and response to light is limited, likely by the quality of streaming video. Users of Google Glass® for teletoxicology reported high levels of comfort with the technology and found it reliable, though as reported reliability decreased, remote users were most affected. Further study should compare patient-centered outcomes when using HMDs for consultation to those resulting from telephone consultation.},

	abstract = {Sickle Treatment and Outcomes Research in the Midwest (STORM) is a regional sickle cell network, funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration Treatment Demonstration Project (HRSA U1EMC27863), established to improve outcomes for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) living in Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin. The STORM network is led by pediatric and adult hematologists who coordinate network activities in each state, along with a Regional Coordinating Center that organizes efforts throughout the Midwest. The goal of the STORM network is to increase the number of pediatric and adult primary care providers (PCP) who are knowledgeable about the management and treatment of SCD, and who are willing to prescribe and manage hydroxyurea therapy as a means to improve medical care for the approximately 15,000 individuals living with SCD in the Midwest. One PCP engagement strategy that has been implemented to increase provider knowledge in the region is replication of the Project ECHOTM (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) telementoring model. Project ECHO was developed by the University of New Mexico to utilize low-cost, high-impact video technology to link expert inter-disciplinary specialist teams with primary care providers to improve management of chronic diseases. This guided practice telementoring model delivers complex specialty medical care to underserved areas, reduces health disparities, and increases workforce capacity. Project ECHO's methodology is based on 1) using telehealth technology to build healthcare resources where they are scarce; 2) sharing best practices to reduce variation in clinical care; 3) utilizing practice-based learning to develop specialty expertise among providers; and 4) monitoring and evaluating provider outcomes. Project ECHO has demonstrated improved healthcare outcomes in Hepatitis C and several other chronic diseases, and is now being piloted by STORM to test its feasibility and applicability for SCD by using a regional approach with CME accreditation. STORM network site physician leads in each state are recruiting multi-disciplinary primary care teams to participate as “spokes” in monthly SCD TeleECHO clinics. The “hub” led by the STORM Regional Coordinating Center, located at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, coordinates implementation and evaluation of the telementoring clinics, delivered through monthly teaching sessions. STORM TeleECHO participants log onto an internet-based virtual meeting site, using a webcam to interact during the session. STORM TeleECHO clinics include brief didactic presentations from nationallyrecognized SCD content experts with topics and curriculum based on the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Evidence-Based Management of Sickle Cell Disease guidelines released in 2014. TeleECHO teaching clinics also include 1-2 de-identified, HIPAA protected case discussions (pediatric and adult) presented by providers who would like medical and psychosocial feedback on management of challenging clinical scenarios. Providers participating in the STORM TeleECHO complete an initial survey assessing knowledge and comfort levels, practice behaviors (including hydroxyurea prescribing practices) and clinic demographics. Satisfaction surveys are sent to participants after each session as part of the CME-credit evaluation. Follow-up surveys at 6 months and 1 year will assess satisfaction, knowledge, comfort level and changes in practice. STORM's TeleECHO was launched in March 2016. Preliminary data indicate an interest in STORM TeleECHO teaching sessions by both pediatric and adult providers across the Midwest region. Future efforts will expand the network to more PCPs in the region, while improving the applicability and utility of STORM TeleECHO in SCD through provider assessment.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The reduction of healthcare costs and societal cost due to remote monitoring (RM) of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) has been demonstrated in several countries; however, to the best of our knowledge it does not exist for South Korea. This work aims at providing an estimation of the potential benefit of RM versus standard care (SC) of CIEDs in term of healthcare costs in South Korea, in order to provide additional substance to the currently ongoing societal debate about the value of telemedicine. METHODS: Healthcare resource consumption was taken from the results of the TARIFF study, a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter clinical trial designed in Italy to assess the economic benefits of RM follow-up in comparison with standard follow-up in 209 patients (107 SC, 102 RM). The main results demonstrated that RM reduced healthcare resource consumption by 54 percent from a healthcare services perspective (SC: EUR1,044.89±1,990.47 versus RM: EUR482.87±2488.10, p{\textless}.0001 (1). In order to perform a cost analysis from the perspective of the South Korean healthcare payer, the following unit costs were assigned to resources collected in TARIFF (hospitalizations, visits, examinations): fee-for-service tariffs, emergency tariffs and outpatient tariffs. Remote follow-up costs were considered as zero. RESULTS: From the perspective of the South Korean healthcare payer, the overall mean annual cost/patient in the RM group is 53 percent lower than in SC group (SC: EUR405,439±40,135 versus RM: EUR189,96±725,52, p{\textless}.0001) (SC: KRW497,145±49,2137 versus RM: KRW 232,936±890,181, p{\textless}.0001). This is mainly due to a significant cost reduction in device-related hospitalizations, examination tests and visits in the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: RM of CIED patients is cost-saving from the perspective of the South Korean healthcare system. Introducing appropriate reimbursement for remote monitoring of CIED is not likely to change this result and should make RM sustainable for the provider and encourage widespread adoption of RM.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In our organization, radioiodine I-131 thyroid ablation patients stay in isolation until the radiation dose rate, to which they expose their environment, has fallen under 40 μSv/h at 100 cm distance. Previously, a radiographer entered the isolation room to check the dose rate the day following the administration day. If the dose rate had not fallen under the discharge limit, she had to repeat the measurement later and be exposed to more radiation. Our aim was to minimize the radiation burden of the staff by conducting dose rate monitoring with a new wireless online measurement system. We expect that it would reduce the number of times a radiographer needs to enter the isolation room, and also the length and consequently, costs of the isolation. Subjects and Methods: A wireless dose rate monitor was positioned into the isolation room beside the bed, approximately 100 cm from the patient's pelvic skin. The system sent dose rate data to a server every minute. Remote monitoring of the dose rate was possible from any device with internet access. Time-dependent dose rates were analyzed for 19 radioiodine I-131 ablation patients (dose 1031-3896 MBq) during their stay at the isolation. The results were compared with the isolation times of the old system (11 patients, 2236- 4026 MBq). Results: The new system reduced the number of times the radiographer entered the room during the isolation from average of 1.2 times to 1 time per patient. Reduction in average radiographer dose was estimated to be 2 μSv per pa- tient. Average isolation time was reduced from 30h to 27h. The mean dose rates at the time of discharge with the old and new systems were 18 μSv/h and 20 μSv/h, respectively. Evaluated with the new system, the 40-μSv/h discharge limit was usually reached during the night, after 12.8 hours of isolation and the patients were discharged 1.3-25.4 hours (mean 13.9h) after reaching the discharge limit. Conclusion: Most importantly, the wireless system reduced the work load and the radiation exposure of the radiographer. Furthermore, the total isolation time was reduced, which saves the hospital resources. By studying the times of I-131 administration, reaching the discharge limit, and the realized and logistically optimal discharge, it is possible to optimize (in our case to postpone) the administration times. This could further reduce the isolation times, and consequently, reduce costs and the radiation exposure of the staff working close to the isolation room.},

	abstract = {Background: Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer among women worldwide with an estimated 527,624 new cases annually and 265,653 deaths. The age-adjusted incidence of cervical cancer in Peru is 34.5 per 100,000 women. Only 40.3\% of Peruvian women are screened for cervical cancer and only 25\% of women with abnormal Pap smears receive an appropriate referral. Lastly, it has been reported that inadequate evaluations of Pap smears in Peru is a significant problem. In a study of 5,435 Peruvian women, Almonte and colleagues showed that pap smears only identified 33.6\% of high-grade dysplasia and 42.5\% of CIS. Objective(s): To determine if digital cervicography (DC) can be used for quality control of visualization with acetic acid (VIA) in the detection of cervical dysplasia. Material/Methods: Two physicians performed VIA on 160 women in mobile clinics in the Peruvian Amazon. DC was then performed using an iPhone attached a hand-held colposcope (Gynocular TM Gynius, Stockholm, Sweden) on 94 women- 77 who were deemed to be VIA negative and 17 who were VIA positive. Women with probable high-grade lesions as determined by DC had cervical biopsies. Blinded DC images were then sent to 2 expert colposcopists (ECs) for evaluation. Results: The 2 ECs identified all 17 women (100\%) who were deemed VIA positive. Both ECs also identified 5 additional digital cervicographs that were VIA negative during screening that appear to show cervical dysplasia. However, at least one of the two ECs determined that 21 images were not fully evaluable. Conclusions: The results of this study show that DC is an adjunct to VIA and to allows for magnified visualization of surface morphology. In addition, it can facilitate telemedicine support, permanent documentation, patient and provider education, and quality control of screening without adding significant time or costs to cervical dysplasia/cancer screening.},

	abstract = {Background Little evidence exists regarding the costs of telemedicine, especially considering changes over time. This analysis aimed to analyze trajectory of healthcare cost before, during, and after a behavioral activation intervention delivered via telepsychology and same-room delivery to elderly Veterans with depression. Methods 241 participants were randomly assigned into one of two study groups: behavioral activation for depression via telemedicine or via same-room treatment. Patients received 8 weeks of weekly 60-min individual sessions of behavioral activation for depression. Primary outcomes were collected at 12-months. Inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and total costs were collected from VA Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) datasets for FY 1998–2014 and compared between the two treatment groups. Generalized mixed models were used to investigate the trajectories over time. Results Overall cost, as well as, outpatient and pharmacy cost show increasing trend over time. Unadjusted and adjusted trajectories over time for any cost were not different between the two treatment groups. There was a significant overall increasing trend over time for outpatient (p{\textless}0.001) and total cost (p{\textless}0.001) but not for inpatient (p=0.543) or pharmacy cost (p=0.084). Limitations Generalizability to younger, healthier populations may be limited due to inclusion criteria for study participants. Conclusion Healthcare costs before, during, and after intervention did not differ between the telemedicine and in-person delivery methods. Outpatient costs accounted for most of the increasing trend of cost over time. These results support policies to use both telehealth and in-person treatment modalities to effectively and efficiently provide high quality care.},

However, current consultation methods come with practical difficulties that can lead to postponed consultation or patient referral instead. Objective. This study aimed to investigate whether a web-based consultation platform, telenephrology, led to a lower referral rate of indicated patients. Furthermore, we assessed consultation rate, quality of care, costs and general practitioner (GPs') experiences with telenephrology. Methods. Cluster randomized controlled trial with 47 general practices in the Netherlands was randomized to access to telenephrology or to enhanced usual care. A total of 3004 CKD patients aged 18 years or older who were under primary care were included (intervention group n = 1277, control group n = 1727) and 2693 completed the trial. All practices participated in a CKD management course and were given an overview of their CKD patients. Results. The referral rates amounted to 2.3\% (n = 29) in the intervention group and 3.0\% (n = 52) in the control group, which was a non-significant difference, OR 0.61; 95\% CI 0.31 to 1.23. The intervention group's consultation rate was 6.3\% (n = 81) against 5.0\% (n = 87) (OR 2.00; 95\% CI 0.75-5.33). We found no difference in quality of care or costs. The majority of GPs had a positive opinion about telenephrology. Conclusion. The data in our study do not allow for conclusions on the effect of telenephrology on the rate of patient referrals and provider-to-provider consultations, compared to conventional methods. It was positively evaluated by GPs and was non-inferior in terms of quality of care and costs.},

Review of task performance videos (with a tutor's voiced-over oral feedback) aids the short-term laparoscopic training of experienced learners. We examined the long-term effects of using this strategy, versus regular practice, on laparoscopic suturing skills in novices. Methods: After 4 practice sessions, 14 novices (7 per group) were randomized post recording of task video (to eliminate bias) to engage in either twice-weekly regular practice (group A) or review of their fourth trial video [with voiced-over oral feedback] (group B). Only subjects in group B received their task videos. Remote monitoring of sessions was via YouTube™ analytics. Results: Averages over 4 trials, of performance time and errors, were obtained after 4 to 6 weeks. Errors were assessed with Group C completed the task faster but not significantly so (p values B Vs A=0.9555). There were significantly less errors in group A compared to group B (p=0.0481). In addition, less errors were noted in those subjects in group B who reviewed their combined visual and oral feedback video just before or on the day of assessment (Just prior to assessment: OSATS scores[18 out of 20; OSATS scores{\textless}18 out of 20) Conclusion (50 words max): In comparison to regular, review of performance videos (with voiced-over oral feedback) produces significantly better technical ability with comparable performance time. It maximizes skill retention in novices (in the long term) learning core laparoscopic procedures and is may be suitable for mastery of more advanced procedures by experienced trainees. Key Statement (50 words max): This strategy produces safer surgeons at little or no cost. Performance videos, incorporating voicedover oral feedback, can be created using smart phones (simulated sessions) and laparoscopic recorders, with audio input provided form wireless head-mounted microphones on the tutor.},

This study investigated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of telemonitoring for improving compliance with CPAP. Methods: Newly-diagnosed OSA patients requiring CPAP (apnoea-hypopnoea index [AHI] {\textgreater}15/h) were randomised to standard management or a telemonitoring programme that collected daily information about compliance, air leaks and residual respiratory events, and initiated patient contact to resolve issues. Clinical/anthropometric variables, daytime sleepiness and quality of life (QOL) were recorded at baseline and after 3 months. Patient satisfaction, additional visits/calls, side effects and total costs were assessed. Results: 100 patients (AHI 52±25/h, 55±13 years, 23\% female) were randomised. There were no significant differences between the standard and telemedicine groups in CPAP compliance (4.9±2.2 vs 5.1±2.1 h/night), symptoms, clinical variables, QOL and unwanted effects. Telemedicine was less expensive than standard management (€123.65 vs €170.97; p=0.022) and was cost effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio €17,358.65/quality-adjusted life-year gained). Overall patient satisfaction was high, but significantly more patients rated satisfaction as high/very high in the standard management versus telemedicine group (96\% vs. 74\%; p=0.034). Conclusions: Telemonitoring was not able to improve CPAP treatment compliance and patients' satisfaction compared to standard care, although it proved to be a cost effective option by reducing the number of scheduled visits to the sleep unit while being associated with similar compliance.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze patient-related cost and time savings associated with a telemedicine strategy for low-risk prenatal care compared to traditional care. STUDY DESIGN: Planned secondary analysis of a prospective randomized- controlled trial of prenatal care using telemedicine versus traditional care for low-risk pregnancies in which patient satisfaction was the primary outcome. Low-risk parous women {\textless}16 0/7 weeks' gestation and carrying a singleton fetus were randomized to receive either a combination of telemedicine and 5 scheduled in-clinic prenatal visits, or traditional in-clinic care (overall number of prenatal visits was unaltered). Telemedicine encounters used a webbased platform and patients entered weight, blood pressure, and fetal heart rate into the electronic medical record patient portal. The primary outcome for this study was total visit-related costs and time usage for the patient. Secondary outcomes included costs and time related to work, personal activities, travel, and childcare. Time data were collected through self-report at 6 visit time points (20, 24, 28, 30, 34, 36 weeks). Analysis was by intent-to-treat and conducted using multivariable generalized linear models and 2-part models. RESULTS: 200 women were randomized and the study groups were statistically similar at baseline. The telemedicine care group had significantly fewer in-clinic prenatal visits compared to the traditional prenatal care group (7.2 vs.11.3 visits, p{\textless}0.0001). Women randomized to telemedicine care had a mean of 4.37 (≥1.9) telemedicine visits. Table 1 shows the time and time cost analyses. Visitrelated costs for women in the telemedicine group were significantly lower compared to women in the traditional arm with a savings of \$13 per telemedicine visit and an overall patient savings of approximately \$56. Total patient time required for visits was also significantly reduced with telemedicine care saving 40 minutes per telemedicine visit and an overall time savings of 3 hours. CONCLUSION: A novel telemedicine strategy for low-risk prenatal care is associated with lower visit-related costs and time savings for patients. (Table Presented).},

	abstract = {Objectives Rural smokers are more likely to be uninsured and live in poverty, which may pose significant cost barriers to accessing smoking cessation medications. As part of a randomized clinical trial, we provided support to connect low-income smokers with the use of pharmaceutical assistance programs (PAPs) to improve medication access. Methods Study participants were rural smokers enrolled in a randomized clinical trial testing in-office telemedicine versus telephone-based approaches to deliver counseling sessions. For potentially qualified participants, we developed a system to connect them with PAPs that provided smoking cessation medications at low or no cost. Participants reported medication utilization 3 and 6 months after randomization. Results Of the 560 study participants, 312 (55.7\%) met initial screening criteria for PAP eligibility. Of those eligible, 104 (33.3\%) initiated a PAP application, with 49 (15.7\%) completing the application and ultimately receiving medications through the programs. Despite the availability of assistance with the PAP application process, overall medication use among those that were eligible for PAP was significantly lower than among participants with higher incomes or access to prescription insurance (60.4\% vs. 51.3\%; P = 0.04). Abstinence among PAP-eligible smokers was also lower at the 3-month follow-up (P = 0.01), but this difference was not present at the 6- and 12-month follow-up surveys. Conclusion With substantial assistance, some low-income smokers without prescription insurance can get effective smoking cessation medications through PAPs, but overall access remains worse than among those with higher incomes or prescription insurance.},

	abstract = {Preliminary Evaluation of an Adult Asthma Adherence Management Program Adults with asthma take less that 50\% of their prescribed medication. The Asthma Adherence Management Program (AAMP) has been shown to be effective in uncontrolled studies of pediatric and adult patients, in both increasing adherence and reducing emergency care. The AAMP was converted to a web-app format (Asthma Adherence Pathway) to permit use in future telemedicine studies. The focus of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the web-app AAMP by means of a randomized controlled trial of adult asthma patients with persistent disease. All study interactions were in person. Methods: Thirty-three subjects (15 Treatment and 18 Control; mean age 42yrs (20-69); Gender: 12M; 21F) were randomly assigned and completed a 3-month nested prospective study of the AAMP. Treatment and Control physicians utilized Dulera 100/200 following NHLBI guidelines. Asthma Control Questionnaires (ACQs) were completed at baseline and at the end of study. Treatment and Control subjects had poor asthma control at baseline (ACQ {\textgreater}1.0 units). Treatment subjects completed the AAMP, identifying adherence barriers (Domains: asthma management, cost, psychological, QoL, support, comprehension and environment). Clinicians applied Motivational Interviewing adherence strategies specific to barrier(s) identified. Treatment subjects were monitored monthly for Dulera adherence by the SmartInhaler and dose counter and given feedback regarding adherence findings. Treatment adherence was determined by the mean of 4 measures over 3-months. Control subjects were not monitored for Dulera adherence. Results: Mean Treatment Dulera adherence in the intervention group was 84\% (44-99). ACQ range 1.1-4.57. Means at baseline for the Treatment group ACQ(MTx=1.99, SD=0.88) and Control ACQ(MC =1.51, SD=0.90) subjects did not differ on ACQ scores (t(31)=1.53, p=0.14). A repeated measures ANOVA with a within-subjects (study entry vs. study end) and a between-subjects (Treatment vs. Control) factor was performed on the ACQ outcome. The time∗group interaction was significant (F(1,24)=13.32, p=0.001) indicating Treatment subjects showed greater improvement (0.92 ACQ units) than asthma control (0.03 ACQ units). Conclusions: Treatment physicians implementing Asthma Adherence Pathway were successful in promoting Dulera adherence for the Treatment group and improving Treatment group asthma control compared to subjects in the Control group.},

	abstract = {Background: In recent years, various studies have firmly established simulation training to be superior to traditional training methods, however it is yet to be fully incorporated into the surgical residency training in outside of North America. In Japan, distribution residents in wider variety of hospital, lack of finance and time for training has limited incorporation of simulation into residency training. There is a need for cost effective systematic training system for novice surgeons. We had previously developed and validated the TAPP checklist, to evaluate the recorded performance of transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair and developed an educational system which included the didactic materials based on the TAPP checklist and incorporated remote evaluation and feedback system. Objective: To evaluate the educational impact of the TAPP education system on novice surgeons. Method: Residents and surgeons from participating hospitals, who had performed 0 or 1 TAPP procedure were recruited for this study from April 2015 to March 2016. The participants were randomly assigned to Intervention Group (IG) who trained using this new educational tool and Control Group (CG) who trained using the conventional system. They were required to send the surgical videos of their TAPP cases. These videos were rated by blinded raters. All the participants performed their first case before randomization as control. The participants scoring more than 20 (full marks 24) in their first case were excluded from the study. IG then received the Educational tools and ratings and feedback from their surgery. They were also encouraged to practice intracorporeal suturing in the drybox. They were allowed to perform further cases after they met the predetermined operator criteria. The improvement of the TAPP checklist scores of both groups were compared from case 1 to 3. We also compared their scores of their 3rd case. Result: The eighteen participants from 9 institutes were recruited for this study. 7 participants in IG and 5 participants in CG completed the study and were included in the final analysis. There was no difference between the backgrounds of the participants. From their first case, the participants in IG and CG had improved their scores by 8.7 (SD5.0) and 1.0 (SD3.2) respectively (p=0.01). The IG score of 3rd case by 21.3 (SD2.0) was significantly higher than that of CG score by 16.4 (SD 4.7) (p=0.04). Conclusion: The newly developed TAPP educational system was effective in improving the TAPP performance of novice surgeons.},

	abstract = {Background: In the USA there is a national initiative in healthcare to decrease hospital readmissions, decrease the cost of care while patients are hospitalized and to increase patient. A recent study evaluating mortality rates in the lung cancer resection patients reported a 30- day readmission was associated with a 6-fold increase in the 90-day mortality of this patient population (14.4\% vs 2.5\%). This report not only forces thoracic surgery teams to extend their operative mortality focus and reporting beyond the traditional 30-day time period but it also emphasizes the critical value and positive impact continued post-operative care for the first three months after discharge can have on patient outcomes. The expert care delivered by thoracic surgery nurses plays a critical role in decreasing post-operative complications and ensuring patients are safely discharged from the hospital. The valuable impact thoracic surgery nurses have on preventing hospital readmissions and improving patient satisfaction is the intended focus of this clinical trial. The positive impact telehealth interventions have on multiple different disease processes supports investigation of this care modality for the thoracic surgery patient population. We have designed a clinical trial focused on implementing a TeleNursing program with the specific aims of preventing hospital readmissions and improving patient satisfaction. Methods: Our thoracic surgery practice currently has a “day-after-discharge” follow-up phone call program that is directed by the thoracic surgery nurses in the practice. Pertinent clinical details of each patient's post-operative course are relayed to the thoracic surgery nurses. The nurses call patients 2-3 days after discharge and asked questions related to medications, pain management, sign or symptoms of infection, activity level and expectations, sleep, appetite and general understanding of all discharge instructions. This interaction is documented in the electronic medical record. This program has been expanded to compare the efficacy of the phone calls vs scheduled video-calls between nurses and patients. Patients are randomized to standard of care day after discharge phone calls vs the TeleNursing follow-up video-call; discharge day 2, 1-month, 2-month and 3- month. All patients complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire at predetermined time points. The primary objective is to decrease hospital readmission rates and the secondary objective is to improve patient satisfaction. Results: Although the results of this clinical trial are pending, interim analysis indicates that patients are willing to participate in this program and are pleased with the nurse-patient interaction beyond their hospital stay. Conclusion: This clinical investigation is ongoing.},

One-hundred thirty two Veterans recruited from a Southeastern Veterans Affairs Medical Center and affiliated University who met criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were randomized to receive PE via HBT or PE via IP. Results indicated that PE-HBT was non-inferior to PE-IP in terms of reducing PTSD scores at post-treatment, 3 and 6 month follow-up. However, non-inferiority hypotheses for depression were only supported at 6 month follow-up. HBT has great potential to reduce patient burden associated with receiving treatment in terms of travel time, travel cost, lost work, and stigma without sacrificing efficacy. These findings indicate that telehealth treatment delivered directly into patients' homes may dramatically increase the reach of this evidence-based therapy for PTSD without diminishing effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and re-lapsing gastrointestinal disorder that requires continuous and per-sonalized follow-up to achieve long remission and minimize short and long-term damage. Telemedicine has been successfully used to provide healthcare services remotely with the implementation of information and communication technologies in IBD patients. Aims: To develop a platform web, TECCU (Telemonitorización en Enfer-medad de Crohn y Colitis Ulcerosa), for a remote control of complex IBD patients (moderate-severe activity) and compare disease activity over 24 weeks in a clinical trial of IBD patients who received standard care (Control-G) vs nursing care by telephone (NT-G) vs intervention based on distance monitoring TECCU-G). Secondarily, to assess health-related quality of life, adverse events, therapeutic adherence and the impact on direct health care costs. Methods: We describe the development of a remote monitoring system and the difficulties encountered in the platform design. Moreover, a three-arm randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this web platform in decreasing disease activ-ity compared to NT-G and Control-G [Image Presented] Inclusion criteria: IBD patients diagnosed according to internation-ally criteria; {\textgreater}be 18 years; CD or UC patients with moderate or severe activity attending in the IBD unit during the inclusion period; Patients starting medical treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive or biological agents. Results: Patients from each group, according to schedules established in relation to the started treatment, answer periodic questionnaires regarding disease activity, quality of life, treatment adher-ence, side effects, satisfaction, work productivity and social activities. Blood and stool (fecal calprotectin) analysis is performed periodically. Based on the results of these tests in G-TECCU, alerts are generated in a platform web, with adapted action plans including changes in medication and following-up frequency. Similarly, in the telephone and usual care groups these interventions are developed by telephone and clinical visits, respectively. Conclusions: The development of a remote management program of IBD patients via web (TECCU) can be a challenge for achieving adequate and safe control of the disease from a distance. The results of this clinical trial could show the efficacy of a web-based telemonitor-ing system to improve disease activity, quality of life and to decrease health care using in complex IBD patients.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of home-based motor monitoring plus standard in-office visits versus in-office visits alone in patients with advanced PD. Methods The procedures consisted of a prospective, one-year follow-up, randomized, case-control study. A total of 40 patients with advanced PD were randomized into two groups: 20 patients underwent home-based motor monitoring by using wireless motion sensor technology, while the other 20 patients had in-office visits. Motor and non-motor symptom severities, quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and comorbidities were assessed every four months. Direct costs were assessed using a standardized questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results Both groups of PD patients were largely comparable in their clinical and demographic variables at baseline; however, there were more participants using levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel in the home-based motor monitoring group. There was a trend for lower Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale functional status (UPDRS II) scores in the patients monitored at home compared to the standard clinical follow-up ( p = 0.06). However, UPDRS parts I, III, IV and quality-adjusted life-years scores were similar between both groups. Home-based motor monitoring was cost-effective in terms of improvement of functional status, motor severity, and motor complications (UPDRS II, III; IV subscales), with an ICER/UPDRS ranging from €126.72 to €701.31, respectively. Discussion Home-based motor monitoring is a tool which collects cost-effective clinical information and helps augment health care for patients with advanced PD.},

	abstract = {Background and Introduction: Telerehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is supported by strong evidence on the effectiveness of such intervention and from a cost-benefit point of view. Satisfaction of patients toward in-home telerehabilitation after TKA has not yet been examined thoroughly in large-scale clinical trials. This study aims to compare satisfaction level of patients following in-home telerehabilitation (TELE) after TKA to one of the patients following a usual face-to-face home visit (STD) rehabilitation. Secondarily, to determine if any clinical or personal variables were associated to the level of satisfaction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was embedded in a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 205 patients randomized into two groups. Rehabilitation intervention was the same for both groups; only approach for service delivery differed (telerehabilitation or home visits). Participants were assessed at baseline (before TKA), at hospital discharge, and at 2 and 4 months postdischarge (E4) using functional outcomes. Patient satisfaction was measured using the validated Health Care Satisfaction Questionnaire (HCSQ) at E4.
RESULTS: Characteristics of all participants were similar at baseline. Satisfaction level of both groups did not differ and was very high (over 85\%). It was neither correlated to personal characteristics nor to improvements of functional level from preoperative to E4. Satisfaction was rather found associated to walking and stair-climbing performances.
CONCLUSIONS: These results, in conjunction with evidences of clinical effectiveness and cost benefits demonstrated in the same sample of patients, strongly support the use of telerehabilitation to improve access to rehabilitation services and efficiency of service delivery after TKA.},

	abstract = {METHODS/DESIGN: We are conducting a large scale randomized controlled trial designed to assess the impact of a navigation program denoted CAPRI that is based on two Nurse Navigators and a web portal ensuring coordination between community and hospital as well as between patients and navigators, versus routine delivery of oral anticancer therapy. The primary research aim is to assess the impact of the program on treatment delivery for patients with metastatic cancer, as measured by Relative Dose Intensity. The trial involves a number of other outcomes, including tumor response, survival, toxic side effects, patient quality of life and patient experience An economic evaluation adopting a societal perspective will be conducted, in order to estimate those health. care resources' used. A parallel process evaluation will be conducted to describe implementation of the intervention.
DISCUSSION: If the CAPRI program does improve treatment delivery, the evidence on its economic impact will offer important knowledge for health decision-makers, helping develop new follow-up services for patients receiving oral chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy. The process evaluation will determine the best conditions in which such a program might be implemented.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT 02828462 . Registered 29 June 2016.
BACKGROUND: The emergence of oral delivery in cancer therapeutics is expected to result in an increased need for better coordination between all treatment stakeholders, mainly to ensure adequate treatment delivery to the patient. There is significant interest in the nurse navigation program's potential to improve transitions of care by improving communication between treatment stakeholders and by providing personalized organizational assistance to patients. The use of health information technology is another strategy aimed at improving cancer care coordination that can be combined with the NN program to improve remote patient follow-up. However, the potential of these two strategies combined to improve oral treatment delivery is limited by a lack of rigorous evidence of actual impact.},

	abstract = {In the HIV Translating Initiatives for Depression into Effective Solutions project, we conducted a randomized controlled effectiveness and implementation trial comparing depression collaborative care with enhanced usual care in Veterans Health Administration HIV clinics in the US. An offsite HIV depression care team including a psychiatrist, a depression care manager (DCM), and a clinical pharmacist provided collaborative care using a stepped-care model of treatment and made recommendations to providers through the electronic health record system. The DCM delivered care management to HIV patients through phone calls, performing routine assessments and providing counseling in self-management and problem-solving. The DCM documented all calls in each patient’s electronic medical record. In this paper we present results from interviews conducted with patients and clinical staff in a multi-stage formative evaluation (FE). We conducted semi-structured FE interviews with 26 HIV patients and 30 clinical staff at the three participating sites during and after the trial period to gather their experiences and perspectives concerning the intervention components. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using rapid content analysis techniques. Patients reported high satisfaction with the depression care manager (DCM) phone calls. Both HIV and mental health providers reported that the DCM’s chart notes in the electronic health record were very helpful, and most felt that a dedicated DCM for HIV patients is ideal to meet patient needs. Sites encountered barriers to achieving and maintaining universal depression screening, but had greater success when such screening was incorporated into routine intake processes. FE results demonstrated that depression care management via telehealth from an offsite team is acceptable and helpful to both HIV patients and their providers. Given that a centralized offsite depression care team can deliver effective, cost-effective, cost-saving services for multiple HIV clinics in different locations with high patient and provider satisfaction, broad implementation should be considered.},

	abstract = {Background: Evidence that home telemonitoring (HTM) for patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) offers clinical beneft over usual care is controversial as is evidence of a health economic advantage. Therefore the CardioBBEAT trial was designed to prospectively assess the health economic impact of a dedicated home monitoring system for patients with CHF based on actual costs directly obtained from patients' health care providers. Methods: Between January 2010 and June 2013, 621 patients (mean age 63,0 ± 11,5 years, 88 \% male) with a confrmed diagnosis of CHF (LVEF ≤ 40 \%) were enrolled and randomly assigned to two study groups comprising usual care with and without an interactive bi-directional HTM (Motiva®). The primary endpoint was the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) established by the groups' difference in total cost and in the combined clinical endpoint "days alive and not in hospital nor inpatient care per potential days in study" within the follow up of 12 months. Secondary outcome measures were total mortality and health related quality of life (SF-36, WHO-5 and KCCQ). Results: In the intention-to-treat analysis, total mortality (HR 0.81; 95\% CI 0.45 - 1.45) and days alive and not in hospital (343.3 ± 55.4 vs. 347.2 ± 43.9; p = 0.909) were not signifcantly different between HTM and usual care. While the resulting primary endpoint ICER was not positive (-181.9; 95\% CI -1626.2 ± 1628.9), quality of life assessed by SF-36, WHO-5 and KCCQ as a secondary endpoint was signifcantly higher in the HTW group at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Conclusions: The frst simultaneous assessment of clinical and economic outcome of HTM in patients with CHF did not demonstrate superior incremental cost effectiveness compared to usual care. On the other hand, quality of life was improved. It remains open whether the tested HTM solution represents a useful innovative approach in the recent health care setting.},

Quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. We assessed the number of HF related events and hospitalizations during the follow-up period. A random effects model was used. Subgroup analysis was based on categorizing devices into direct hemodynamic measuring devices (DHMDs) and impedance-based devices (IBDs). Results: Of the 5 trials, 3 assessed DHMDs and 2 IBDs. Of the 2 trials which assessed IBDs, one was stopped prematurely because of increased HF related events in the intervention arm but it was included in the analysis. One. The relative risk for HF related events for all studies combined was 0.83 (95\% CI 0.70-0.99). Applying this RR to the control event rate, we calculated a number needed to treat of 6. Meta-analysis of the two IBD studies did not fnd a reduction in HF related events i.e. 0.94 (95\% CI 0.41-2.12). Whereas, the 3 DHMD studies did have a signifcant impact on HF related events 0.82 (95\% CI 0.69-0.98). The 2 trials that examined the secondary outcome of HF readmissions were the COMPASS and CHAMPION trials, with a 30\% reduction in HF readmission with a relative risk of 0.71 (95\% CI 0.60-0.83). Conclusions: Overall, telemonitoring implantable devices in NYHA III/IV HF patients reduces HF related events by about 17\% 6. IBDs tend to be less effective when compared to DHMDs. There is 30\% reduction in HF readmission rates for NYHA III/IV patients DHMDs are implanted.},

	abstract = {Background: The Southeastern United States has the lowest rates of kidney transplant in the nation. Disparities in transplant access among end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients may be attributable to the initial stages of the transplant process, including transplant evaluation. Transplant center providers have yet to be surveyed about patient evaluation barriers and center practices. We aimed to identify transplant center staff perceived patient barriers to kidney transplant evaluation. Methods: We emailed a 54-item survey to transplant coordinators and social workers at 9 transplant centers in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. We assessed staff perceived patient barriers to evaluation including the evaluation length, distance to transplant center, required medical testing, and services offered to reduce patient barriers, such as patient education and financial resources. Results: A total of 34 coordinators and social workers from 7 centers completed the survey. Staff reported that the average number of patient evaluation visits is 2.1 (range: 1, 5) and 43\% of centers require patients to complete {\textgreater}5 medical tests prior to evaluation. When asked to identify reasons why patients may not present for evaluation, staff reported lack of transportation to the transplant center (62\%), lack of understanding about the transplant process (35\%), and concerns about posttransplant medication costs (24\%). To relieve travel-related concerns, some centers have satellite clinics (43\%), telemedicine programs (29\%), reduced parking costs (43\%), and discounted overnight housing (57\%) (Figur presented). Prior to evaluation, some centers require patients to complete in-person (29\%) or online (14\%) transplant education sessions. None of the centers require patients to fundraise prior to evaluation and 4 centers give patients an opportunity to speak with a financial coordinator prior to evaluation start. Conclusion: Understanding transplant staff perceived barriers to evaluation may help inform center-specific interventions to increase evaluation rates among ESRD patients, and also ensure providers are aware of their center's policies so they can be better communicated to patients.},

	abstract = {Objective: To report a large-scale regional teleneurology experience to guide prospective programs Background: Caring for patients with neurological problems will increasingly use teleneurology, the application of telemedicine in neurological disease. The rise of risk-based contracting and population health management (PHM) place efficiency pressures on healthcare systems, which struggle with cost-effective access to neurologists while the community supply shrinks, producing “deserts of expertise.” In this environment, teleneurology becomes an ideal PHM solution for community and tertiary care hospitals. Design/Methods: We report our teleneurology experience - inpatient populations throughout New England. the largest reported to date - which spans outpatient and Results: The experience covers most neurological conditions, subspecialties, and care settings, delivered by three different service lines: (1) hospital emergency consultation (inter-institutional, n= 11,322 cases, 2001-2016), (2) hospital/office routine/urgent consultation (inter- and intra-institutional, n=633 cases, 2012-2016), and (3) direct patient ambulatory visits (intra-institutional; n=1,541 cases, 2013-2016). These services represent different clinical and financial models, technologies, challenges, and opportunities. 92\% of emergency consults were for acute stroke, while 8\% covered other conditions. Acute stroke treatment rates for virtual consults were similar to our own emergency ward (38\%) for eligible patients. 70\% and 87\% of the emergency and routine/urgent consultations, resp., were phone only. 60-75\% of emergency consults and 90\%-95\% of routine/urgent consults remained in the community. Direct patient visits saved 100 miles and 2 hours of driving time per visit. Conclusions: Teleneurology aims to bring expertise to the patient and not the reverse. Initially conceived as means to improve access to acute stroke care, it can be viewed as a tool with farther reaching capabilities. Such pathways are becoming increasingly common across the country, whereby our broad experience may assist prospective programs in increasing access to expertise in a safe, effective, and patient-centered and value-based approach to neurologic care.},

Objective We sought to analyze the potential benefits gained from the addition of dermoscopic images to an internet-based skin cancer screening system. Methods A randomized clinical trial assessed the diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness of clinical teleconsultations (CTC) and clinical with dermoscopic teleconsultations. Results A total of 454 patients were enrolled in the trial (nCTC = 226, nclinical with dermoscopic teleconsultation = 228). Teledermoscopy improved sensitivity and specificity (92.86\% and 96.24\%, respectively) compared with CTC (86.57\% and 72.33\%, respectively). Correct decisions were made in 94.30\% of patients through clinical with dermoscopic teleconsultations and in 79.20\% in CTC (P {\textless} .001). The only variable associated with an increased likelihood of correct diagnosis was management using teledermoscopy (odds ratio 4.04; 95\% confidence interval 2.02-8.09; P {\textless} .0001). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed teledermoscopy as the dominant strategy, with a lower cost-effectiveness ratio (65.13 vs 80.84). Limitations Potentially, a limitation is the establishment of an experienced dermatologist as the gold standard for the in-person evaluation. Conclusions The addition of dermoscopic images significantly improves the results of an internet-based skin cancer screening system, compared with screening systems based on clinical images alone.},

Background: Increasing physical disability and geographic distance from centers can limit the access of ALS patients to specialized care. Telemedicine improves access, but start-up cost and technical limitations may prevent more widespread utilization. Design/Methods: A telemedicine pilot was initiated at a single center. An existing enterprise platform (Microsoft Lync) was used. The mobile app for Lync (Skype for Business) was downloaded for free by participants. Availability of high-speed home Internet, email and phone access and a personal device with camera were required. Patient education about the pilot and technical set-up were developed. Workflows were created to triage telemedicine visits with patients. An encounter-type request was submitted to the EMR and billing departments. Results: Twelve patients and three providers (physicians, nutritionist) participated in the pilot. One patient terminated participation due to technical difficulties and fatigue. Technical difficulties occurred in all other test encounters as well, but were readily resolved. Technical challenges were related to personal device set-up, Internet connectivity at home, handling of devices, and use of video/volume controls during videoconferencing. Patients and providers reported high levels of satisfaction with the availability of telemedicine. Visits effectively addressed sensitive issues (advance directives and end of life care), but required adjustments in the process of care delivery (reading caretaker emotions off-screen, maintaining eye contact, etc.). Conclusions: It is feasible to create a telemedicine program prototype with minimal start-up cost. Technical and disease-specific barriers require ongoing, rapid-cycle adaptations. Satisfaction of participants in this pilot was high. Charge capture is essential for financial sustainability. We plan a randomized-controlled research study to investigate the impact of telemedicine on quality of care, patient and caregiver satisfaction and cost of care.},

	abstract = {Objective: We undertook the design and implementation of a proactive telecommunication tool, EpxEpilepsy, to more accurately and frequently track seizures, thereby improving the care of epilepsy patients. Additionally, we present a cost-benefit analysis that demonstrates its capability to enable new revenue generation for providers under recent fee-for-service codes. Background: To fill in the gaps between often long periods between clinic visits, epilepsy management revolves around self-recorded seizure diaries, which can be inaccurate and incomplete. Tracking seizures with high temporal resolution is critical for medication titration, which is key to reducing the time to seizure freedom. Design/Methods: EpxEpilepsy is an automated service that uses text messages and phone communications to ask patients about seizure events. Responses are tracked and summarized for the provider both in text and graphical formats with alerts notifying the provider of high-risk individuals. 9 patients from the Washington University Epilepsy Center with a diagnosis of epilepsy were enrolled. Patients received one text message every week for 12 weeks. After the initial 4 weeks, patients were interviewed to understand their experience using EpxEpilepsy. The goal of the pilot study was to track response rates, message fatigue, the percentage of patients who reported seizure activity, and the number of seizures that could be detected by the system. Results: We achieved a 74.1\% response rate (95\% confidence interval ±8.38\%) and detected 180 seizures, with a third of our patients at a 100\% response rate. Conclusions: While the study suffers from a small sample size and a nonrandomized uncontrolled design, our data suggests that EpxEpilepsy provides a promising platform for proactive seizure tracking in epilepsy patients. As such, a randomized control trial is ongoing with a larger sample size examining EpxEpilepsy's effect on time to seizure freedom.},

	abstract = {Background: Although results of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) are beneficial, many eligible patients do not participate in CR, and the beneficial effects of CR are often not maintained over time. Home-based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve participation rates and enhance long-term effectiveness. However, evidence on its relative cost-effectiveness compared to centre-based CR is scarce. Methods: We randomized 90 low to moderate risk patients entering CR to 3 months of either home-based training (HB) or centre-based training (CB). We conducted an economic evaluation by comparing healthcare and non-healthcare costs of both groups after one year, and a cost-utility analysis based on quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs). Results: The QALYs calculated for both groups were similar (CB: 0.78±0.08, HB: 0.77±0.13, p=0.73). The costs for the CR programmes were similar between groups (CB: E336±68, HB: E314±68, p=0.13). Total healthcare costs for the HB group were E437 less than for the CB group, and total non-healthcare costs were E2,723 less for the HB group. However, these differences were not significant (p=0.39 and p=0.12 respectively). From a societal perspective, a non-significant difference of E3,160 per patient in favour of home-based CR was found (p=0.09) and the probability that it was more cost-effective varied between 97\% and 75\% (willingness-to-pay of E0 and E100,000 per QALY respectively). Discussion: Although we found no statistically significant differences in QALYs and costs between home-based CR and centre-based CR, almost all components in the economic evaluation were favourable for the home-based CR. For the accepted willingness-to-pay per QALY (€20,000-40,000), we conclude that home-based CR training appears to be more cost-effective than centre-based CR. [TABLE PRESENTED].},

	abstract = {Background: Home telemonitoring has developed considerably over recent years in chronic diseases in order to improve communication between healthcare professionals and patients and to promote early detection of deteriorating health status. In the nephrology setting, home telemonitoring has been evaluated in home dialysis patients but data are scarce concerning chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients before and after renal replacement therapy. The eNephro study is designed to assess the cost effectiveness, clinical/biological impact, and patient perception of a home telemonitoring for CKD patients. Our purpose is to present the rationale, design and organisational aspects of this study. Methods: eNephro is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, comparing home telemonitoring versus usual care in three populations of CKD patients: stage 3B/4 (n = 320); stage 5D CKD on dialysis (n = 260); stage 5 T CKD treated with transplantation (n= 260). Five hospitals and three not-for-profit providers managing self-care dialysis situated in three administrative regions in France are participating. The trial began in December 2015, with a scheduled 12-month inclusion period and 12 months follow-up. Outcomes include clinical and biological data (e.g. blood pressure, haemoglobin) collected from patient records, perceived health status (e.g. health related quality of life) collected from self-administered questionnaires, and health expenditure data retrieved from the French health insurance database (SNIIRAM) using a probabilistic matching procedure. Discussion: The hypothesis is that home telemonitoring enables better control of clinical and biological parameters as well as improved perceived health status. This better control should limit emergency consultations and hospitalisations leading to decreased healthcare expenditure, compensating for the financial investment due to the telemedicine system.

	abstract = {Background: Acute Heart Failure (HF) management often results in expensive emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Remote patient managing systems could permit outpatient management of acute worsening of CHF with significant economic savings. Purpose: Demonstrate how the use of the Beacon Patient Management System for outpatient HF monitoring can permit heart failure management in an outpatient setting and prevent emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Methods: The beacon outpatient monitoring system uses transtelephonic monitoring of multimodality information, which can be integrated by the patient's physician and allied health personnel managers. The ability to monitor various components of the patient's status including heart rate variability, percentage of atrial and ventricular pacing, and thoracic impedance are utilized to “trigger” communication with the health care providers to permit resolution of HF rapidly and economically. Results: A sample case of a 65 yo female with renal insufficiency, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, and severe systolic HF requiring intermittent inotropic infusions, and limited ambulatory status was monitored using the beacon system. Serial transmissions eventually showed her ventricular pacing declined, impedance index increased, and heart rate variability indicated clinical instability. As a result of these remote monitoring transmissions the patient was brought to an outpatient facility where her ventricular lead capture was reprogrammed to 100\% pacing, atrial fibrillation frequency was treated with amiodarone and anticoagulation therapy, and milrinone infusions were adjusted from intermittent to continuous. Within two weeks beacon transmissions confirmed impedance index returned to normal, atrial fibrillation frequency dropped to zero, and ventricular pacing had risen to 100\%. Conclusions: The Beacon system offers a remote monitoring system, which is rapid and provides accurate assessment of a patient's HF status. This permits prompt changes in device programming, initiation or adjustment of anticoagulation, medication adjustments, and optimum scheduling of subsequent care. This not only provides a method with extreme patient acceptance, but also a major economic advantage. In this further use of remote monitoring can greatly enhance congestive HF management. The beacon management system transmissions information made it possible to easily treat clinically unstable symptoms in an outpatient setting (\$300.00) resulting in considerable financial savings to the patient as compared to the high cost of an inpatient hospitalization (\$4000.00).},

METHODS: Patients with ongoing care at Penn Medicine, taking 4+ chronic oral medications, and established nonadherence to lipid lowering, anti-hypertensive, or oral diabetes therapies were invited to participate in the randomized controlled trial. Consenting patients were randomized to treatment or control arms and observed for 6 months. Patients in the treatment group received a commercially available service that includes 1) aligning the patient's medication regimen into weekly multi-dose blister packages that insert into 2) a remote monitoring pillbox that alerts the patient with lights, sounds, phone, or text message reminders when a dose is missed and 3) relays adherence information to study staff for outreach if {\textless} 80\% of doses are taken for three consecutive days. Patients in the control group received usual care without reminders or outreach. RESULTS: Treatment (N=17) and control (N=33) groups were well-matched for demographics and adherence prior to randomization. In the 12 months prior to index date, the treatment group had an average PDC of 70.4\% vs. 69.5\% for the control group. All patients in the treatment group moved from non-adherent (PDC{\textless} 80\%) in the prior period to adherent in the treatment period across all drug classes of interest with number of on-time refills moving to 98\%. At 6 months, treatment patients had higher rates of therapy persistence at 91.3\% remaining persistent at 6 months vs 61.8\% for control (Log-rank p{\textless} 0.05). Potential covariates age, gender, education level, and race were not statistically significant in predicting early therapy termination. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on the intervention demonstrated significant and sustained improvements in medication adherence. Further testing should be done to determine the effectiveness of the approach on clinical outcomes and cost related measures.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Some of the major challenges encountered in the delivery of peritoneal dialysis(PD) service include significant amount of clinical nurse specialist time being spent on travelling to patients' homes, a largely reactive response to dialysis related issues, relying heavily on patients reporting problems to the dialysis team and delays in translating changes to prescription into changes in treatment. Sharesource is a cloud based connectivity device which when attached to a patient's peritoneal dialysis machine allows for real-time on demand access to patient's peritoneal dialysis data via a web browser and can be used to monitor therapy and intervene where necessary. It can be remotely accessed to reprogramme the dialysis machine. This electronic devise has the potential to improve the care of patient on PD while saving both time and cost. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of the Sharesource device on the management of PD patients with emphasis on time and cost saved, prompt translation of prescription into treatment, reduction in the incidence of PD related complications and frequency of PD related hospital admissions. METHODS: A Single center study of 2 cohorts of patients on PD. The study is in 2 phases. The first phase was to assess the incidence of PD complications and PD related hospital admissions over 12 months prior to the introduction of share source device as well as assess the time spent on and cost of home visits and phone calls to patients. In the first phase a total of 18 patients who have been on PD for at least 12 months were assessed. The cost of patients' home visit and phone calls over an 18day period was estimated. Case notes and clinic letters as well as the nurses' records of visits and telephone calls to patients were analysed. The second phase was aimed at assessing the impact of sharesource device on patient care, time and cost effectiveness over a 12month period. RESULTS: So far, the result of phase one of our study is available. Mean age of patients was 65.4±11.8yrs. Average duration on PD 21.8±11months.Table 1: Incidence of PD complications in a 12months period prior to Sharesource. n=18 patients A total of 1544 minutes was spent on patient home visit and phone calls over a period of 18days was while the cost of phone calls for 18days was £673.16. The estimated cost of Sharesource over the 18-day period is £529.80 CONCLUSIONS: The use of the Sharesource device has been shown to be cost effective and initial audit suggests that 12hrs/week of nurse time could be saved. The second phase of the study is aimed to show the effect of the cloud based remote monitoring system on the incidence of PD complications and frequency of hospital admissions. There are additional advantages in terms of monitoring the adequacy of therapy and blood pressures remotely but data is required to shed more light in this. (Table presented).},

Focus on better supported discharge, regular patient coaching by telemedicine and mobile health solutions show promise to augment therapeutic adherence, reduce length of stay and readmissions. We aimed to assess feasibility of in-hospital initiated and post-discharge, personalized coaching program and its impact on selfreported adherence to risk factor management. Method: This prospective, multicenter cohort study is being conducted in four Belgian stroke centers. Recruitment of eligible inpatients (175) will be allowed between February-August 2017 and patients will be coached during 6 months' post-discharge. Baseline, risk factors follow-up, and video consultancy (at 0,5-1-3-6 months) are guided by the mobile health application specifically designed. Results: The primary study outcome is risk factor control. A summary score of four objective measures of risk factor control (systolic bloodpressure, LDL cholesterol, fasted glucose level and antiplatelet adherence selfreport) will be used. Goals for the different risk factors were described in detail. In addition, secondary endpoints are (a) quality-oflife (EQ-5D); (b) impact on long term clinical outcome (mRS) and (c) stroke recurrence rate at six months. A detailed health-economic evaluation will also be conducted. Conclusion: If proven effective and feasible, implementation of this innovative model executed by a personal stroke coach, initiated during hospitalization and using a web-based intervention program, can easily be unrolled in other stroke units. The program can be cost-effective in case of improved recurrence rates, self-care and adherence.},

Avoiding low value hospitalizations from the ED through clinical pathways, decision support tools, observation care and coordination of services are potential strategies but there may be important rural-urban differences to consider. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey was emailed to medical directors and/or nurse managers of the 135 hospital-based EDs in Michigan. Questions included presence of clinical pathways, factors influencing admission decisions, standardized services aimed at reducing avoidable admissions and barriers in connecting patients to outpatient services. We determined if EDs were located in rural/micropolitan or urban counties based on the U.S. Office of Management and Budget definitions. Descriptive statistics and chi-square were used for the analysis. Results: Responses were received from 64 (49\%) of the 131 EDs reached. EDs were well distributed throughout the state, 36 in urban counties and 28 in rural/micropolitan counties. Clinical pathways to facilitate discharge or avoid admission were reported at 31 sites and more likely in urban than rural EDs (58\% vs. 36\%). Three quarters of both urban and rural EDs reported presence of programs to connect patients to outpatient resources and avoid admission. Of these, home health services and wound care were more commonly reported by rural than urban EDs (46\% vs. 41\% and 50\% vs. 31\%, p {\textless} 0.001) and observation units were less common (39\% vs. 47\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Rapid PCP and specialist follow-up, ED follow-up clinics and telemedicine programs were infrequent. Urban EDs reported greater influence of PCPs and specialists on admission decision (50\% vs. 41\% and 53\% vs. 27\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Few sites utilized social workers, care managers, physical therapy and ED-based pharmacy regardless of urban/rural setting. Barriers to connecting ED patients to outpatient services were reported lower for rural than urban settings, including lack of family support (74\% vs. 83\%), timely PCP follow-up (65\% vs. 80\%), timely specialist follow-up (83\% vs. 87\%), and support for discharge planning (65\% vs. 83\%) (p {\textless} 0.001 for each comparison). Conclusion: Rural-urban differences in ED resources and barriers demonstrate unique challenges necessitating a tailored approach to reducing avoidable hospitalizations.},

METHOD: This was a secondary analysis of a randomized clincial trial with 134 rural-dwelling adults 65 years and older with decreased quality of life and elevated psychological symptomatology. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the anxiety and phobic anxiety subscales of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R).
RESULTS: Compared to a minimal support control condition, CBT for depression resulted in significantly greater improvements in symptoms of anxiety and phobic anxiety from pre-treatment to post-treatment.
CONCLUSION: Home-delivered CBT for depression can be an effective treatment for anxiety in a hard-to-reach older populations.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Additional research should explore integrated anxiety and depression protocols and other treatment modalities, including bibliotherapy or telehealth models of CBT, to reduce costs associated with its in home delivery. Flexibility in administration and adaptations to the CBT protocol may be necessary for use with vulnerable, rural older adults.},

	abstract = {Background: The decision to admit a patient from the ED is complex and multifactorial. Avoiding low value admissions requires safe and cost-effective outpatient care options as well as ED processes to access alternatives to hospital care. We assessed the resources available to emergency providers when making hospital admission decisions with the goal of identifying potential interventions for quality improvement. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey was sent via email to medical directors and/or nurse managers of the 135 hospital-based EDs in Michigan. Questions included: (1) identifying groups that influence the decision to admit; (2) availability of standardized programs or services in the ED, hospital or community to reduce avoidable admissions; and (3) barriers to connecting patients with outpatient services that could obviate the need for admission. ED characteristics and perceptions regarding admission rates were also collected. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Results: Of the 131 EDs reached, 64 (49\%) responded. EDs were geographically distributed throughout the state, ranging in size from 3 to 111 beds (mean 26.6) with 1,800 to 127,000 visits (mean 39,725) annually. Three-quarters of respondents thought their hospital's administration viewed their ED admission rate as appropriate. Forty percent of respondents reported primary care physicians (PCPs) were always or frequently involved in their admission decisions and 45\% always or frequently involved specialists. Fewer reported involvement by utilization review (33\%), social work (26\%), and case managers (20\%). The most common programs and services designed to reduce avoidable admissions were home health care (64\%), observation units (62\%), and wound care services (55\%). The least common were telemedicine programs (7\%), rapid specialist follow-up (4\%), and ED follow-up clinic (4\%). Preferences for admission from patient/family (55\%), specialists (53\%) and PCPs (36\%) were commonly perceived barriers to connecting patients with outpatient service to avoid admission. Conclusion: Within a geographically diverse set of EDs in Michigan, there are few services supporting emergency providers connecting patients with outpatient care options as alternatives to hospitalization. Awareness and additional resources are likely integral to reducing avoidable admissions.},

The EU funded Project SmartCare (“Cohort study on integrated health and social care supported by ICT for European citizens”) involved as lead our region with the aim of improving integrated social and health care through the implementation of home telemonitoring (TLM), empowerment, self-care and self-management of heart failure pts. Methods: The SmartCare project in our region has developed as a cohort study, prospective, randomized, controlled trial that enrolled from 11/2014 to 2/2016 201 pts in home care ({\textgreater}50 years, at least 1 severe CNCD (HF, COPD or diabetes) and ≥1 missing BADL) to intervention arm (INT - automatic BP monitoring, weight, FC, SO2, ECG: n=100) or usual care (UC; n=101). The drop-out were 19 (7 UC; 12 INT; p=NS). The patients were followed up by a multiprofessional team (nurses - including a case manager-, GPs, social workers, district doctors and specialists) and stratified for “short term” post-discharge TLM (3-6 months - average 4±1; n=101) or “long-term” (6-12 months - average 10±3; n=100) for chronic frail pts already in home health care. Results: The patients enrolled were elderly (81 years, 54\% males), with HF (79\%), diabetes (68\%) or COPD (38\%) and multimorbidity (44\% Charlson Index ≥5; 58\% ≥7 drugs/day). 58\% had a primary level of education, 38\% lived alone and 43\% were not self-sufficient. In the follow-up of 7±4 months (119 pt-years) were recorded 16 deaths (13.4/100 pt-years) and 126 hospital admissions/access to intermediate care (1758 days of hospitalization). The home care nurses has recorded 3053 contacts (2.14/pt-months; 2417 -79.2\% - home accesses of which 160 (6.6\%) unplanned; 536 -20.8\% - phone calls). In pts enrolled in “long term” INT, TLM has not proven effective. In contrast, in pts enrolled in the “short-term” post-discharge INT was demonstrated a significant reduction in hospital stay (0.9 vs 2.8 pt-months; p=0.048), due to a reduction of the length of stay (10.2 vs 19.2 days; p=0.01), associated with a significant increase in unplanned contacts (1.15 vs 0.03/pts; p=0.04). In particular, each month there was a saving of 1.9 hospital days at the “cost” of 0.7 contacts per patient for control of devices and clinical stability. The same significance was present only in pts with HF. Conclusion: A postdischarge intensive TLM system supported by ICT of pts with CNCD and in particular with HF, on top of home care, is able to significantly reduce the hospital stay with significant but modest increase use of territorial nursing resources.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous published studies on home telemetry have suggested inconsistent results and current published systematic reviews have not included recent trials leading to indeterminate conclusions. This meta-analysis aims to assess the utility of home telemonitoring strategies on disease management and clinical outcome in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (chronic CHF). Methods: A search in Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1995 to Nov 2016) was performed and identified 14 randomized controlled studies (RCT's) designed to evaluate the effect of home telemonitoring on the management and clinical outcome of patients with chronic HF (Table 1). For the clinical endpoints of All- Cause Mortality (primary objective) and Hospital Readmission for HF (secondary objective), we calculated Risk Ratios with 95\% confidence intervals using Mantel-Haenszel Random Effects model. The degree of heterogeneity was evaluated by the I2 index. Publication bias assessed using Funnel plots. Results: In total, 4410 patients were randomized for primary outcome, of whom 2,150 were allocated to home telemonitoring (HTM) and 2,260 patients to control. The time of follow-up ranged from 3 months to 1 year. Pooled analysis of primary objective across 9 RCT's showed that there was 20\% mortality benefit which was statistically significant in Telemonitoring group (MH-RR=.80, 95\% CI: 0.67-0.97, p{\textless}0.02; Figure 1) as compared to control. Analysis based on secondary objective among 11 RCT's showed that there was 13\% benefit in HF hospitalization but was not statistically significant in Telemonitoring group (MH-RR=.87, 95\% CI: 0.73-0.1.03, p=0.11; Figure 2) as compared to control. Conclusion: Home telemonitoring has lost favor as a promising noninvasive strategy to intensify and improve HF management in the outpatient setting. However, its role may be under utilized in the patientcentered home with potential to reduce all-cause mortality. Furthermore, albeit statistically insignificant, there was a reduction in hospitalization for HF. Future studies should evaluate this potential in more detail and reveal if this strategy is cost-effective in reducing the health and economic burden associated with HF.},

However, the exact clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of RM are still under investigation. Objective: The MONITOR-ICD study (NCT 00787683) was designed to assess costs, cost-effectiveness and clinical benefits of RM versus standard care (SC) ICD FU in a randomized multicenter trial. Methods: Eligible patients were implanted with a single- or dualchamber RM-capable Biotronik ICD. ICD programming and alertbased clinical responses in the RM group were standardized by protocol. Disease specific costs from a societal perspective were defined as primary endpoint. ICD shocks, hospitalizations, mortality and quality of life (QoL) were secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint was compared using ANOVA, adjusted for center, on an intention-to-treat basis. Time-to-event comparisons were done using univariate Cox-regression (adjusted for center). Results: A total of 416 patients were recruited in 13 specializedcare centers, of which 14 (3.3\%) dropped out, 199 patients were randomized to RM, 203 patients to SC. Age was 63±12 years, 81\% were male, LVEF was 35±12\%, 70\% had ischemic heart disease. Indication was primary prophylaxis in 57\%; 78\% were first implantations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The provision of patient information leaflets regarding telehealth has been perceived by potential consumers as a strategy to promote awareness and adoption of telehealth services. However, such leaflets need to be designed carefully if adoption and awareness among potential users is to be promoted. Therefore, the aims of this study were: first, to see how telehealth was portrayed in some of the existing telehealth leaflets (THLs). Second, to explore patients' perceptions of the existing THLs and their engagement with the concept and how THLs can be optimised.
METHODS: A two-step approach was employed to address the aims of this study. The first phase involved the use of discourse analysis to compare 12 electronically and publically available THLs, with the existing THL guidance "Involve Yorkshire and Humber". The second phase involved conducting 14 semi-structured interviews with potential telehealth users/patients to gauge their perception and engagement with the concept, using the two leaflets that were mostly matching with the guidance used. Six interviews were audio-recorded and eight had detailed jotted notes. The interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed to identify key themes.
RESULTS: The discourse analysis showed certain gaps and variations within the screened leaflets when addressing the following aspects: cost of the telehealth service, confidentiality, patients' choices in addition to equipment use and technical support. Analysis of the interviews revealed patients' need for having clear and sufficient information about the telehealth service within the THLs; in addition to, patients' preference for the use of simpler terminologies for telehealth description and the provision of clear simple texts with pictorial presentations. The interviews also revealed certain limitations against adoption of telehealth by the participants, such as: lack of privacy and confidentiality of information, fear of technology breakdown and equipment failure, loss of face-to-face contact with healthcare professionals and being too dependent on the telehealth service.
CONCLUSION: The current study showed a great variation among the screened THLs and highlighted certain gaps within the content and presentation of these leaflets. However, the study also highlighted certain key issues to be considered when designing THLs in the future to enhance telehealth uptake and use by patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Therapeutic advances in multiple myeloma (MM) mean that patients have extended periods of remission without need for active anti-myeloma therapy. This provides an opportunity to review how these patients are managed and design patient-centred healthcare systems. Remote monitoring systems have been implemented for other cancer patients in remission. Aims: We aimed to explore patient needs during stable remission from MM and the influence of these on acceptability of remote monitoring. Methods: Patients with stable MM in a treatment-free interval selected from outpatient clinics at a tertiary centre completed a survey which explored the acceptability of various methods of remote monitoring. Subsequently semistructured interviews were conducted by an independent researcher to investigate factors influencing this preference. Interviews were carried out until saturation of themes, transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was performed using open coding by a doctor, physiotherapist and psychologist. Results: 78 patients were surveyed; the most acceptable alternative was a telephone clinic (with doctor 77\%, nurse 69\%). 19 interviews were conducted exploring suitability of a nurse-led telephone clinic (TC) replacing current face to face (FTF) consultations with a doctor. Median age was 61years (range 46-76), and 9 were male. 18 patients were in 1st remission; 16 had most recently received high dose therapy and autograft, 3 had post autograft consolidation. The centre was not the local hospital for 18 patients interviewed. The majority were accepting of TC as an alternative to FTF clinics due to the burden of travel, associated cost and clinic waiting times. These affected patients' physical and psychological well-being, with TC perceived as less burdening. Patients acknowledged reduced needs during remission compared to treatment phase and felt TC would benefit redistribution of consultant time for patients on active therapy. Some patients suggested this service change would be more beneficial for healthcare resourcing rather than them personally. Interpretation of blood results by clinicians was regarded as central to monitoring disease, and for some who were unaware of clinical symptoms, the only way a relapse would be detected. General preference was for bloods to be done locally, leading to concerns about availability of results for TC. Patients were unsure how to monitor their own MM, hence valued the knowledge of their medical team. Doctors were perceived to have more expertise than nurses and this influenced preferences regarding who undertook TC. As a result, patients sought reassurance they could see a doctor if they had any concerns after TC with a nurse. Patients valued continuity under the centre where they were treated due to prior positive experience and the importance of being seen at a tertiary centre renowned for its expertise in MM. This influenced acceptability of TC as long as they remained under the centre's care with preference for continuity of staff involved. Whilst TC was acceptable for patients in remission, some were concerned about how relapse would be managed and expressed preference for FTF when being told they had relapsed. Summary/Conclusions: Nurse led TCs are an acceptable alternative to FTF consultations for monitoring patients in remission from MM. Design of healthcare systems incorporating TCs need to have robust systems for accessing blood test results, for managing relapse, ready access to doctors and reassurance about the competence and knowledge of practitioners involved.},

New CGM technology can wirelessly transmit values to specially trained teams to prevent adverse events. A pilot randomized controlled trial conducted at a large hospital in San Diego evaluated the acceptability and performance of an integrated digital approach to glucose management for 45 high-risk patients with T2D. Participants had an expected LOS {\textgreater} 48 hours, A1c {\textgreater} 8\% or point-of-care blood glucose {\textgreater} 180 at admission, and required insulin during the hospitalization. DexCom G4 CGMs were placed on all participants; bedside values were blinded. Intervention group CGM values were wirelessly transmitted to a management team while the control group had usual care. Protocols were designed for early intervention to prevent hypo- and hyperglycemia. Age ranged from 43 to 82 yrs (M=61.4, SD=9.8); the majority were male (56\%) Hispanic (73\%), and Spanish was a preferred language (60\%); A1c (M=10.2\% SD=2.3) and BMI (M=32.9, SD=8.0). CGM data was obtained for an average of 4.27 days/patient (SD=2.49; range 2-10). Number of CGM readings ranged from 102 to 2334/patient (M=859.4, SD = 627.8). There were no statistically significant differences between groups on the amount of CGM data obtained (p {\textgreater}.05). Trends of small-to-moderate effect size were observed for intervention vs. control group differences in the percentage of values per patient {\textless} 70 mg/dL (0.7\% vs. 1.4\%; d = 0.26), {\textgreater} 250 mg/dL (9.8\% vs. 13.2\%; d = 0.23), and {\textgreater}300 mg/ dL (2.6\% vs. 5.1\%; d = 0.30). Patient survey revealed that the CGM group felt this “Helps prevent problems rather than fixing them after they've happened” (p=.04). No difference in comfort, sleep or interruptions (p{\textgreater}.05). This pilot demonstrates remote monitoring by glucose management teams in hospitalized high-risk patients is feasible, safe, and acceptable with trends for reduced hypo- and hyperglycemia.},

	abstract = {Background: Advanced battery chemistry, enhanced circuit efficiency, and new algorithms play a role in increasing the longevity of newer devices compared to legacy models. Increased longevity, one of the important goals in CRT-D therapy, reduces replacement-related complications (hematomas, infections, lead-related issues etc.) that are associated with significant morbidity, and costs, beyond generator themselves, in the longer-term. The magnitude of benefit will differ by indicated patient population, as life expectancy also influences total replacements anticipated. Purpose: Assess longevity of current and historical Medtronic CRT-Ds based on real life experience. Estimate number of generator replacements by patient population and quantify cost savings. Methods: Projected generator longevities and programming data were obtained from currently implanted models from the pan-European CareLink remote monitoring database and contrasted with historical data from the literature. Claria/Amplia MRI and Viva XT devices, with AdaptivCRT, enabled in both cases, were compared with Consulta legacy generators. Data from clinical trials informed anticipated patient survival by indication. Complication rates were derived from literature. Costs were assessed for the Italian, Swiss and UK (English) healthcare systems. Results: Data were extracted from 3,687 Viva XT and 647 Claria/Amplia MRI devices and compared to generator survival of 532 predominantly Consulta devices (Landolina 2016). Currently implanted Viva XT CRT-Ds project 8.1±1.7 years (Mean±SD) longevity; Claria/Amplia MRI devices 9.0±1.4 years (p{\textless}0.01). New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III patients were 75.1\% likely to require a single Claria/Amplia MRI generator, 69.8\% a Viva XT generator and 50.2\% a Consulta one. Given a median patient survival of approximately 14 years, NYHA Class II patients will on average require two generators; the probability that a third generator is required was reduced to 7.2\% with current devices compared to 53.4\% with the Consulta generation. Cost savings for Claria/Amplia MRI against Consulta were €4,377, €16,655 (CHF17,870), €7,925 (£6,856) for Class III patients and €8,337, €31,726 (CHF34,041), €15,098 (£13,061) for Class II patients for Italy, Switzerland and the UK respectively (CHF1=€0.932, £1=e1.156). Conclusions: Medtronic CRT-D generator projected longevity has substantially increased compared to historical models, leading to projected substantial reductions in replacement procedures and, thus, morbidity and costs.

Background: Increasing interest has been focused on the use of web-based clinical trial assessments (virtual research visits) given the rising cost and difficulties with recruitment and retention in clinical trials. Virtual research visits have the potential to reduce infrastructure costs, expedite recruitment, and improve participant retention through improved accessibility and convenience of trial participation. Methods: We are conducting an add-on study of 40 individuals with PD enrolled in the phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial STEADY-PD III (Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy Assessment of Isradipine for Parkinson's disease). Enrolled participants complete virtual research visits using a smart phone device equipped with telehealth software from AMC Health. Each participant will complete two to four virtual visits over 12 months, occurring within four weeks of their scheduled in-person research visits. All clinical trial assessments performed at the preceding in-person visit are performed remotely during the virtual research visit. Study outcomes include (1) feasibility determined by the ability to conduct remote assessments; (2) reliability of remote assessments compared to in-person assessments; (3) value of virtual visits measured by patient and provider preference of remote versus in-person visits. Results: To date, 40 participants have been enrolled and consented. 33 participants have successfully completed their first visit and all participants are scheduled to complete at least one visit by March, 2017. 88\% (28/33) of virtual research visits have been completed as scheduled, and all virtual research visits have been completed. The study will be completed in March, 2018. Conclusions: This study assesses the feasibility and comparability of remote assessments to in-person assessments in an ongoing PD clinical trial. Preliminary results suggest the intervention is feasible. Further results will determine if virtual research visits are a reliable and valuable method of conducting clinical trials, and may serve as a model for increasing access, recruitment, and retention in PD clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study reports the methodology and 1-year results Of a regional service model of teleconsultation for planning and treatment of complex thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA). Methods: Complex TAAA without a feasible conventional surgical repair were prospectively evaluated by expert vascular surgeons of the same health public provider (National Health System) dislocated in a huge area of 22,994 km2 with 3.7 million of inhabitants and 11 tertiary hospitals. Surgeons evaluated computed tomography scans and clinical details, which were placed on a Web platform (Google Drive, Calif) and shared to all surgeons. Patients give informed consent for the teleconsultation. The surgeon who submitted a case discusses in detail his or her case and prospects for a possible therapeutical strategy. The other surgeons suggest other solutions and options in terms of grafts, techniques, or access to be used. Angiographic and clinical outcomes of cases are then presented at the following telemeetings, and a final agreement of the operative strategy is evaluated. Teleconsultation is performed using a Web conference service (web.conference.com; Avaya Inc, Basking Ridge, NJ) with a monthly appointment. Results: The rate of participation was constant (mean surgeons, 11 [range, 9-15]). Twenty-four complex TAAAs were discussed for the difficult planning and/or operation during the study period. The concordance for planning and therapeutic strategy among all participants was complete in 16 cases; in one case, the consultation was decisive for creating an innovative therapeutic strategy, while in the remaining five cases, the strategy proposed by the patient's tutor was changed completely following the discussion. A surgical team composed by surgeons from different centers performed two of the 24 procedures. Conclusions: Such a regional service of teleconsulation may be of value in standardizing the treatment and derived costs of complex TAAAs in a huge region under the same health provider. The shared decision-making strategy may be of medical legal value as well.},

Design Single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Setting General community. Participants Convenience sample of adults with SCI (N=84; mean time post-SCI, 9.9y; mean age, 46y; 73.8\% men; 44\% with paraplegia; 58\% white). Interventions Trained peer health coaches applied the person-centered health self-management intervention with 42 experimental subjects over 6 months on a tapered call schedule. The 42 control subjects received usual care. Both groups received the MCMC Resource Guide. Main Outcome Measures Primary outcome—health self-management as measured by the Patient Activation Measure (PAM). Secondary outcomes—global ratings of service/resource use, health-related quality of life, and quality of primary care. Results Intervention participants averaged 12 calls over 6 months (averaging 21.8min each), with distinct variation. At 6 months, intervention participants reported a significantly greater change in PAM scores (6mo: estimate, 7.029; 95\% confidence interval,.1018–13.956; P=.0468) compared with controls, with a trend toward significance at 4 months. At 6 months, intervention participants reported a significantly greater decrease in social/role activity limitations (estimate, −.443; P=.0389), greater life satisfaction (estimate, 1.0091; P=.0522), greater services/resources awareness (estimate, 1.678; P=.0253), greater overall service use (estimate, 1.069; P=.0240), and a greater number of services used (estimate, 1.542; P=.0077). Subgroups most impacted by MCMC on PAM change scores included the following: high social support, white persons, men, 1 to 6 years postinjury, and tetraplegic. Conclusions This trial demonstrates that the MCMC peer-led, health self-management intervention achieved a positive impact on self-management to prevent secondary conditions in adults with SCI. These results warrant a larger, multisite trial of its efficacy and cost-effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Introduction Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) independently alters the clinical course of cardiovascular diseases resulting in a significant reduction in all-cause and cardiac mortality. However, only 15\%-30\% of all eligible patients participate in a phase 2 ambulatory programme. The uptake rate of community-based programmes following phase 2 CR and adherence to long-term exercise is extremely poor. Newer care models, involving telerehabilitation programmes that are delivered remotely, show considerable promise for increasing adherence. In this view, the PATHway (Physical Activity Towards Health) platform was developed and now needs to be evaluated in terms of its feasibility and clinical efficacy. Methods and analysis In a multicentre randomised controlled pilot trial, 120 participants (m/f, age 40-80 years) completing a phase 2 ambulatory CR programme will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to PATHway or usual care. PATHway involves a comprehensive, internet-enabled, sensor-based home CR platform and provides individualised heart rate monitored exercise programmes (exerclasses and exergames) as the basis on which to provide a personalised lifestyle intervention programme. The control group will receive usual care. Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months after completion of phase 2 of the CR programme. The primary outcome is the change in active energy expenditure. Secondary outcomes include cardiopulmonary endurance capacity, muscle strength, body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, peripheral endothelial vascular function, patient satisfaction, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), well-being, mediators of behaviour change and safety. HRQoL and healthcare costs will be taken into account in cost-effectiveness evaluation. Ethics and dissemination The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

	abstract = {I hope to present the trial protocol as a poster at ASCO with co design work commencing 2017. Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in NZ. 85\% of registrations annually are stage four at diagnosis, presenting a significant burden on resources. Despite novel therapies, survival is poor and quality of life is a key consideration in patient management . Currently the aim of surveillance is to detect for disease progression and follows a three monthly pattern. There is little literature around benefits of surveillance on survival, and quality of life in these patients. Alternative approaches to surveillance should be evaluated to ensure safe, convenient, economical care. Lung cancer outcomes for Maori patients sit significantly lower than those for New Zealand Europeans. Maori patients are twice as likely to present with locally advanced disease and four times less likely to receive curative treatment (multivariate analysis). There are significant barriers for Maori patients to attending health care including time off work, health literacy, costs, child care, language barriers, and transport. Ministry of Health data describes poor outcomes for Maori lung cancer patients with rate of death sitting at 3.4 times that of non-Maori. Co-Primary End Points To determine if there is a reduction in health services utilisation (ED visits, hospital visits, unplanned clinic visits, GP visits, and Nurse Specialist contact) with the end point identified at progression, lost to follow up, or death. To compare the impact of a novel virtual surveillance model (VSM) versus usual follow-up care on patient anxiety measured using the HADS-A tool. Methods: LuCaS is a Randomised Controlled trial in patients with advanced lung cancer randomised to virtual model or standard care. Results: recruitment begins this year. Conclusions: Hypothesis: A virtual follow up model for advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer patients, extensive stage small cell lung cancer patients, and mesothelioma patients will reduce health care utilisation and patient experienced anxiety defined by reduction in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) score, while maintaining effectiveness detecting recurrence and survival.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke, predominantly a condition of older age, is a major cause of acquired disability in the global population and puts an increasing burden on health care resources. Clear evidence for the importance of intensity of therapy in optimizing functional outcomes is found in animal models, supported by neuroimaging and behavioral research, and strengthened by recent meta-analyses from multiple clinical trials. However, providing intensive therapy using conventional treatment paradigms is expensive and sometimes not feasible because of social and environmental factors. This article addresses the need for cost-effective increased intensity of practice and suggests potential benefits of telehealth (TH) as an innovative model of care in physical therapy.
SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: We provide an overview of TH and present evidence that a web-supported program, used in conjunction with constraint-induced therapy (CIT), can increase intensity and adherence to a rehabilitation regimen. The design and feasibility testing of this web-based program, "LifeCIT," is presented. We describe how wearable sensors can monitor activity and provide feedback to patients and therapists. The methodology for the development of a wearable device with embedded inertial and mechanomyographic sensors, algorithms to classify functional movement, and a graphical user interface to present meaningful data to patients to support a home exercise program is explained.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: We propose that wearable sensor technologies and TH programs have the potential to provide most-effective, intensive, home-based stroke rehabilitation.},

Because CMC account for a large share of health care use costs, finding effective ways to care for them is an important challenge requiring exploration.
METHOD: This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial with a control group and two intervention groups. The focus of the analysis was planned and unplanned clinical and therapy visits by CMC over a 30-month data collection period. Nonparametric tests were used to compare visit counts among and within the three groups.
RESULTS: The number of unplanned visits decreased over time across all groups, with the greatest decrease in the video telehealth intervention group. Planned visits were higher in the video telehealth group across all time periods.
DISCUSSION: Advanced practice registered nurse-delivered telehealth care coordination may support a shift from unplanned to planned health care service use among CMC.},

	abstract = {Background: The advent of new-generation, highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has presented an ambitious but achievable opportunity to eliminate the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a major public health issue by 2030. These remarkably effective treatments, combined with a negligible side-effect profile, have now enabled management of most patients in a primary care setting. The achievement of the lofty elimination goal demands development of new models of care. This includes engagement of general practitioners with specialist support, while maintaining a patient-centered approach. The primary vehicle for assisting with a GP model of care is currently via nurse-led community programs or use of the remote consultation form in conjunction with specialists. Small studies before the DAA era suggest equivalent sustained virological response (SVR) rates with community HCV therapy via telehealth models; however, loss to follow-up may be higher than in tertiary settings. Digital health technologies represent a new opportunity to facilitate timely, coordinated, participatory medicine, and potentially address many of the roadblocks preventing GP initiation of HCV treatment, while ensuring adequate specialist supervision and follow-up if required. Methods: HealthElink is a custom-made, web-based portal intended to promote patient-centered chronic disease management. Patient-, nurse-, GP-, and specialist-specific interfaces allow development and delivery of custom treatment plans, direct messaging capabilities between each party, electronic reminders, progress indicators, and streamlined task management for tertiary teams. The HCV-specific module has an inbuilt algorithm which enables the GP to generate an appropriate treatment regimen, based on Australian Liver Association consensus guidelines, by entering specific viral and host biochemical characteristics. Other features include automated calculation of surrogate markers of fibrosis and incorporation and real-time integration with the University of Liverpool hepatitis drug interaction checker. A prospective, multicenter pilot of HealthElink across primary care services in South Australia, Victoria, and the Northern Territory, as well as prison services in South Australia and the Northern Territory, is scheduled to begin in June 2017. The primary outcome is SVR at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include patient, doctor and nurse satisfaction; cost analysis; and number of treatment initiations per practitioner. Additional data regarding time spent on the portal by each person and usage statistics will be gathered. We anticipate preliminary results to be presented in mid 2018, followed by a qualitative analysis at the completion of the study to further elicit the clinician and patient experience of using the portal. A usability study is currently underway comparing HealthElink with the current standard of care using the GESA remote consultation form via task-based observation. This includes qualitative analysis of the user experience and measurement of time taken to complete a specialist referral via HealthElink compared with current practice (the remote consultation form). Final pre-launch testing of HealthElink is concurrently underway, involving the prison service in South Australia using de-identified data. Results: Seven patients have been successfully recruited via prison medical officers through the HealthElink portal as part of pre-launch final testing. The HealthELink HCV treatment algorithm provided appropriate treatment options to prison medical officers for all seven patients (based on viral and host characteristics). One patient was excluded from remote treatment initiation and referred for further investigation via the portal based on a low platelet count, despite an aspartate aminotransferase to platelet index of less than 1.0. Recruitment for the formal pilot study is expected to commence in June 2017. We anticipate preliminary results to be presented in mid 2018.},

We instituted a telemedicine program for pediatric DR and analyzed epidemiologic and disease factors of screened children. Methods: Retrospective chart review. Results: Over 1 year, 494 childreen meeting ADA criteria for ophthalmic evaluation had non-mydriatic fundus screening in the diabetes clinic in an ongoing program. Prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 8.3\%. The first twenty-nine patients with abnormal Results: were compared to 35 randomly selected normals. Duration of diabetes (median of 12 and 7 years in the abnormal and normal groups respectively, P = 0.003) and age (median of 17 and 16 respectively, P = 0.04) were different in univariate analysis (Wilcoxon test). Average A1c, duration of disease, age and sex showed some importance as predictors of an abnormal screening, but none reached statistical significance in a penalized logistic regression model, likely due to limited power. Discussion: The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in children screened is substantially higher than that previously reported from retrospective reviews of eye clinic records, likely due to poor compliance of most-at-risk children with formal eye examination. This program has decreased the number of children needing eye examinations by 90\% compared to ADA recommendations. Conclusions: Telemedicine is an attractive and cost-effective means of evaluating children at risk for diabetic retinopathy.},

Methods A randomised controlled 12-month trial of 42 patients with severe COPD was conducted. Home TM of oximetry, temperature, pulse, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, spirometry, and weight with telephone support and home visits was tested against a control group receiving only identical telephone support and home visits. Results The results suggest that TM had a reduction in COPD-related admissions, emergency department presentations, and hospital bed days. TM also seemed to increase the interval between COPD-related exacerbations requiring a hospital visit and prolonged the time to the first admission. The interval between hospital visits was significantly different between the study arms, while the other findings did not reach significance and only suggest a trend. There was a reduction in hospital admission costs. TM was adopted well by most patients and eventually, also by the nursing staff, though it did not seem to change patients' psychological well-being. Discussion Ability to draw firm conclusions is limited due to the small sample size. However the trends of reducing hospital visits warrant a larger study of a similar design. When designing such a trial, one should consider the potential impact of the high quality of care already made available to this patient cohort.},

	abstract = {Aim Although cardiac rehabilitation improves physical fitness after a cardiac event, many eligible patients do not participate in cardiac rehabilitation and the beneficial effects of cardiac rehabilitation are often not maintained over time. Home-based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve participation rates and enhance long-term effectiveness. Methods and results We randomised 90 low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation to three months of either home-based training with telemonitoring guidance or centre-based training. Although training adherence was similar between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home-based group (p = 0.02). Physical fitness improved at discharge (p {\textless} 0.01) and at one-year follow-up (p {\textless} 0.01) in both groups, without differences between groups (home-based p = 0.31 and centre-based p = 0.87). Physical activity levels did not change during the one-year study period (centre-based p = 0.38, home-based p = 0.80). Healthcare costs were statistically non-significantly lower in the home-based group (€437 per patient, 95\% confidence interval -562 to 1436, p = 0.39). From a societal perspective, a statistically non-significant difference of €3160 per patient in favour of the home-based group was found (95\% confidence interval -460 to 6780, p = 0.09) and the probability that it was more cost-effective varied between 97\% and 75\% (willingness-to-pay of €0 and €100,000 per quality-adjusted life-years, respectively). Conclusion We found no differences between home-based training with telemonitoring guidance and centre-based training on physical fitness, physical activity level or health-related quality of life. However, home-based training was associated with a higher patient satisfaction and appears to be more cost-effective than centre-based training. We conclude that home-based training with telemonitoring guidance can be used as an alternative to centre-based training for low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation.},

Methods: In this study, 116 eligible patients with HFmrEF (LVEF 40-49\%, 27 patients) or HFpEF (LVEF ≥50\%, 89 patients) were randomized to either structured follow-up in the basis of face-to-face encounters (usual care group-UC-, 66 patients) or delivering healthcare using telemedicine (TM, 50 patients). Telemedicine included daily signs and symptoms telemonitoring and structured follow-up by the means of video or audio-conference. The primary end-point was non-fatal HF events after 6 months of follow-up. Cost calculations were based on full-costing allocation to assess direct costs derived from clinical activity. Results: The mean (SD) age of the patients was 77 (10) years, mean (SD) LVEF was 58\% (10), 47\% were female, and 28\% were frail patients. In Cox proportional hazards models, the hazard ratio for the primary end-point was 0.33 (95\% CI, 0.17-0.64; p-value=0.001) in favour of telemedicine. Similars results were seen when event risk was analysed in 4 groups (UC+HFmrEF, UC+HFpF, TM+HFmrEF, TM+HFpEF; figure 1, p-value=0.011).

The telemedicine group experienced a significant mean net reduction in direct costs of Δ3,170 per patient per 6 months of followup (p-value=0.001). This reduction was mainly driven by a relative reduction of 55\% in the cost associated with re-hospitalizations (p-value=0.006).

However, the exact clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of RM are still under investigation. Purpose: The MONITOR-ICD study was designed to assess costs, costeffectiveness and clinical benefits of RM versus standard care (SC) ICD follow-up in a randomized multicenter trial. Methods: Eligible patients were implanted with a single- or dual-chamber RMcapable Biotronik ICD. ICD programming and alert-based clinical responses in the RM group were standardized by protocol. Disease specific costs from a societal perspective were defined as primary endpoint. ICD shocks, hospitalizations, mortality and quality of life (QoL) were secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint was compared using ANOVA, adjusted for center, on an intention-to-treat basis. Time-to-event comparisons were done using univariate Cox-regression (adjusted for center). Results: A total of 416 patients were recruited in 13 specialized-care centers, of which 14 (3.3\%) dropped out, 199 patients were randomized to RM, 203 patients to SC. Age was 63±12 years, 81\% were male, LVEF was 35±12\%, 70\% had ischemic heart disease. Indication was primary prophylaxis in 57\%; 78\% were first implantations. After follow-up of 1.56±0.60 years, cases of deaths were equally distributed (RM: 20, SC: 15, hazard ratio (HR) 1.34, 95\% CI 0.68-2.61, p=0.398). Total disease-specific costs were higher (not significant) in the RM group with €8964 per year (6972-10956), than in the SC group €6699 (4716- 8682) (p=0.09). In the RM and SC group, 25 (12.6\%) and 15 (7.3\%) patients, respectively, received one or more ICD shocks. Time to first appropriate shock (1.67 [0.83-3.33], p=0.148), time to first inappropriate shock (2.14 [0.39-11.71] p=0.379) and time to first appropriate shock or appropriate ATP (1.60 [0.97-2.63] p=0.064) did not differ significantly between RM and SC. QoL measured with SF-12, MacNew and Florida ICD Acceptance did not change from baseline to follow-up and did not differ between RM and SC. Conclusions: In this multicenter randomized trial in a specialized-care setting in Germany, disease-specific costs, mortality, and the time to ICD therapies did not differ significantly between RM and SC.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Telemedicalmanagement of gestational diabetes (GD) can be more effective than the conventional or classical management by improving and simplifying the course, increasing patients and healthcare users satisfaction and enabling significant reductions in costs. We compared data from a center in the “Ile De France” using the myDiabby telemedical platform (TLM group), to those of a center in the “Hauts De France”, carrying out a conventional monitoring, enriched with a hotline (HOT group). Materials and methods: The available TLM / HOT data were collected for all 300 and 203 patients followed in the two centers respectively, during the year 2015. The main maternal characteristics, essential pregnancy data and major events of childbirth were compared. All data were entered into a computerized program. In addition, a satisfaction questionnaire was sent to the patients and the medical team of the TLM group. After an initial training workshop, patients in the TLM group were only followed by e-mails exchanged on a secure messaging system, which could also be used to send an electronic chart of self-monitoring of blood glucose. Those in the HOT group had episodic visits and could call the nurses by H24 hotline, communicate their blood glucose results, which were then reported manually. Specialised nurses assisted mothers in insulin dose adjustment, under the supervision of medical doctors. Results: (TLM/ HOT) For maternal characteristics, the mean age was 33 / 30.5 years, patients were less obese in the first group (BMI{\textgreater}25: 20/ 80\%), and we found history of GD in 15/19\% of the mothers. 42/21\% of mothers were more than 35 years old; 5/8\% have a history of foetal macrosomia and 46/40\% had a family history of type 2 diabetes. GD was early diagnosed in 25/44\%, insulin was needed in 32/48\% of the cases. Mean term delivery were the same at 39wks, with 28/26\% caesarean section. The average weight of the babies was the same, 3333/3314 grams, of which respectively 3 and 10\% were {\textgreater} 4000 grams. In the TLM group, women were less obese but older, with more history of diabetes, less early diagnosis and less insulin, same term, caesarean sections, and the same mean weight of babies but less macrosomes. Differences between the two populations were moderate except for hospitalizations. While only 2.5\% of women in the TLM group were hospitalized, this figure rose to 27\% in the HOT group, an identical figure was found at the national level. Time saving in decision making, improved overall visibility, catch-up of loss sight were advised as benefits by the TLM medical team and patients in this group all wished to recommend this follow-up for identical situations. Conclusion: The HOT group has already benefited from improved support thanks to a dedicated team and hotline. “Mother-child” outcomes are of high quality in an area where medical facilities are lagging behind the national average. An orientation in this group towards telemedicine is an option, the results are equal or better with a major benefit at the level of hospitalizations whose drop close to disappearance is both an organizational benefit, an improvement in the quality of life of the Future mother and a very important minimization of the overall cost of care.},

Out-of-hospital-treatment in the form of a hospital at home (HH) is a potential alternative, but the evidence is limited. This study aimed to test feasibility of performing a full trial of HH in acutely ill older patients. Methods: We conducted a feasibility study in acutely ill patients ≥65 years admitted to the Emergency Department. Patients were included based on five main criteria: General eligibility, medical status, treatment requirement, cognition, and willingness to participate. Patients were transferred home within 36 hours with subsequent daily visits from healthcare professionals. Telemedicine technologies were used to increase the safety of the patients. Results: Of 601 patients screened (median age=80 years, 56\% female) only 7 (1\%) were eligible and willing to participate. Main reasons for not participating were poor status of health and scepti-cism towards the home admission. Patients admitted at home felt safe and found several positive aspects. Health-care professionals found that the HH intervention gave the opportunity to create a patient-centred treatment. The intervention was not successfully integrated because of the few cases resulting in unfamiliarity with the setup. Economic evaluation found that HH had no economic advantages over usual in-hospital admission. Conclusion: HH for older acute medical patients was not feasible in the design that we tested. The severity and complexity of patients, together with the existing competences of the municipality health-care staff, does not justify proceeding to a large randomised controlled trial with this set up.},

	abstract = {Background: The emergence of oral delivery in cancer therapeutics results in an increased need for better coordination between all treatment stakeholders, mainly to ensure adequate treatment delivery to the patient. There is a significant interest in cancer care coordination programs, especially those combining Nurse Navigators (NN) and the use of new technologies. However, the potential impact of these combined strategies is limited by a lack of rigorous evidence. Trial design: A monocentric randomized trial (1,000 patients, 1:1) is designed to assess the impact of a cancer care coordination program namely CAPRI. This program is based on two NN and a web application. NN ensure remote patient monitoring, via phone calls and email. They also provide a link between hospital professionals, patients and primary care professionals (GP, private nurse, pharmacist, etc.) by giving them access to the web application with the patient's authorization. Patients can enter data related to their health. Alerts are sent to the NN in case of abnormal data. NN evaluate the alert level on the basis of algorithms and determine the necessary action. The study will evaluate CAPRI's efficacy in comparison with regular care during a 6-month period for adult patients with metastatic cancer. Hypothesis is that with a closer monitoring of the patient, the management of toxicities is more efficient and results in fewer dose adjustments of oral cancer therapeutics and avoids unnecessary hospital visits. The primary research aim is to assess the impact of the CAPRI program on treatment delivery for cancer patients who started oral cancer therapy, as measured by Relative Dose Intensity. The trial involves several secondary outcomes: patient adherence, tumor response, survival, toxicities, patient quality of life and patient experience. An economic evaluation adopting a societal perspective will be conducted, in order to estimate the use of healthcare resources. A parallel process evaluation will be conducted to describe the implementation of the CAPRI program. Of the 1,000 patients to be recruited, 109 patients are currently enrolled since November 2016.},

PROMETE II is a multicentre, randomized controlled trial lasting 12-months conducted in five hospitals in Madrid, Spain. COPD patients in stable condition (6 weeks without a COPD exacerbation) were randomized to either telehealth (TH) or routine clinical practice (RCP), The main objective was to reduce the number of COPD exacerbations leading to ER visits/hospital admissions. Overall, 237 COPD patients were recruited, and 229 (96.6\%) were randomized to either TH (n=115) or RCP (n=114). Participants had a mean±SD age of 71±8 years and 80\% were men. There were no statistically significant differences in the primary efficacy analysis of the proportion of participants who had a severe COPD exacerbation leading to ER visits or a hospital admission (59.5\% in TH vs. 55.7\% in RCP; p=0.556). Similarly, the mean number of exacerbations over the 12-month period was comparable between groups, 1.0 in TH vs. 0.9 in RCP (p=0.286). However, there was a non-significant trend towards a shorter mean total duration of hospitalization in the TH group (18.9±16.4 days) compared to the RCP group (22.3±19.7 days), p=0.353, and of fewer days in the ICU, 6.0±4.6 vs.13.3±11.1 days, p=0.349. At month 12, the number of all-cause deaths was comparable between groups (11 in TH vs. 13 in RCP). Lastly, telehealth was evaluated highly positively by both participating physicians and patients. We conclude that remote patient management did not reduce the COPD-related ER visits or hospital admissions compared to routine clinical care within 12 months.},

	abstract = {Objective: Blood pressure telemonitoring with remote counseling (BPTM) represents a useful tool for effective management of hypertension (HTN). Unfortunately, the evidence provided by recent studies on economic benefits of this approach is incomplete. The aim of this research was to compare the costs and cost-effectiveness of telemedicine-based intervention and standard care in hypertensive patients. Design and method: The study enrolled 80 patients aged 18-85 (median 53 years old) with uncontrolled HTN. The subjects were randomized to gender, age and baseline BP - matched groups: BPTM group (n = 50) and usual care (n = 30) with clinic visits. Duration of follow-up constituted 3 months. Economic evaluation consisted of total healthcare costs calculation both for BPTM and usual care settled in Euro currency. Cost of illness (COI), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) assessment along with cost-utility analysis (CUA) with the use of Short Form-36 (SF-36) were performed. Results: BPTM group had significantly larger decrease of systolic BP compared to standard care (-16 ± 6 mmHg; p = 0,04) while the number of antihypertensive drugs in BPTM remained unchanged (+0,3 drugs; p = 0,15). COI was 2.36 times higher in BPTM than in usual care (196.9 € vs. 83.5€; p {\textless} 0.005). An ICER was 8.45 €/mmHg (95\% CI 4.9 € to 12 €) per patient. BPTM improved quality of life (+2.9 for physical component SF-36; p = 0.04) with 0,06 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient. The resultant CUA for BPTM was 2698 € per QALY for patient which is also cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20383 € per QALY gained. Extrapolating target BP holdover effect to a ten-year period, a cost-benefit analysis showed that BPTM is more cost-saving than usual care approach (-672.5 € per patient). Conclusions: Blood pressure telemonitoring with remote counseling facilitate achievement of target blood pressure level in a cost-effective and cost-saving way. The management costs will be compensated by potential prevention of future expenses for complications.},

	abstract = {Objective: Telemedicine system for chronic disease management is being proposed in many countries since many years. These systems impact the patient behaviour, medication-taking, and important physician behaviours: promoting medication regimen adherence in patients and appropriately modifying therapy when existing therapy results in inadequate therapeutic effect. We recently launched a multicentre, prospective, cross-sectional study, aimed to evaluate whether a home telehealth system that allows the patient to monitor blood pressure (BP) and blood glucose (BG), with remote educational support and feedback to the general practitioner, can improve BP control and other risk factors, metabolic control, overall cardiovascular risk and medication adherence in hypertensive individuals, as compared to usual practice. Design and method: 300 patients with uncontrolled hypertension and who are followed by primary care physicians will be randomized to either a “usual care group” or a “telemedicine group”. Participants will receive validated electronic BP and BG measuring device connected through GPRS (FORA DUO ultima D40 g). They will self-test BP, BG and results will be uploaded and transmitted directly via a home telehealth system to a central database. Transferred data are integrated in the patient's file in “e-CoreLab system” and will be available to the center team. Abnormal 1 week adjustable mean values for BP and BG will be notifed and relevant abnormalities will trigger an alarm which will be sent to the investigator by SMS or e-mail. A virtual visit (phone call or video) will take place at least every 2 weeks, according to the alert trigger and objective deviation in the group receiving the pharmacological treatment with Telehealth Solution. Clinical examination, biology assessment and 24 hour Ambulatory BP Monitoring (BP-Lab® or Mobil-graph®) will be done at baseline and during the follow-up period (6 months). Results: Results are expected to be available by 2018. Conclusions: We hypothesize that more subjects in the telemedicine group will achieve BP and BG goals than in the control group. This will occur through increases in knowledge, self-management, shared decision-making, and improved doctor-patient interaction. We believe that telemedicine can facilitate patient care and in a cost effective manner.},

Methods: We report the results on the initial 10 VTB-evaluated patients of an ongoing prospective qualitative case study screened between October 2016 and March 2017. Eligibility required patients with advanced solid tumours that were either rare or refractory to standard therapy and written informed consent. Cases were evaluated by a patient-activated multidisciplinary VTB that included pathologists, genetic and molecular diagnostic specialists, oncologists, radiation-oncologists, radiologists, and clinical research coordinators. Prioritisation of recommendations by VTB was done based on a proprietary algorithm and knowledge-base, including data such as survival, response rates, primary oncologist and patient preferences, comorbidities, and anticipated adverse events as per CTCAE. Tumour biomarkers and next-generation-sequencing by CLIA-compliant settings were evaluated to provide cost-effective predictive therapeutic prioritisation, estimated time-to-results, and clinical trial allocation.

Targeting interventions to patients who are most likely to benefit should improve their efficiency and clinical impact. This study aims to test the impact of three cost-equivalent pharmacist-led interventions on insulin persistence and glycaemic control among patients with diabetes. Methods and analysis TARGIT-Diabetes (Targeted Adherence Intervention to Reach Glycemic Control with Insulin Therapy for patients with Diabetes) is a randomised controlled trial that will evaluate three different multifaceted pharmacist-outreach strategies for improving long-term insulin use among individuals with diabetes. We will randomise 6000 patients in a large insurer to one of three arms. The arms are designed to deliver an increasingly intensive intervention to a progressively targeted population, identified using predictive analytics. The central component of the intervention in all arms is a tailored telephone consultation with a pharmacist which varies across arms based on the: (A) proportion of patients offered the intervention and (B) intervention intensity, including follow-up frequency and cointerventions such as text reminders and interactions with patients' providers. The primary outcome is insulin persistence, assessed using pharmacy claims data, and the secondary outcomes are glycaemic control as measured by glycosylated haemoglobin values, healthcare utilisation and healthcare spending.

The patients' self-reported PRO data are used by clinicians as decision aid to support whether a patient needs contact to the clinic or not. Based on experiences from AmbuFlex, the Danish government and regions, who run the public hospitals, have decided on a national strategy for implementation of PRO. The aim is to describe experiences with large scale implementation of PRO in outpatient follow-up. Method: The AmbuFlex concept includes three generic elements: PRO data collection, PRObased decision algorithm, and PRO-based graphical overview. Experiences will be described with respect to these elements. Furthermore, experiences with evaluating the value of PRO will be described. Results: By January 2017, AmbuFlex is used by approximately 19,000 patients within 18 different patient groups in Denmark. In outpatients with epilepsy and sleep apnoea, 48 and 57\%, respectively, of the incoming PRO responses were handled without further contact to the patient than the PRO assessment. A randomised study among outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis has found that PRObased tele-health follow-up achieved similar disease control as conventional outpatient follow-up. Clinicians as well as patients reported high satisfaction with the system. Conclusion: The use of PRO in outpatient follow-up is feasible and may be recommended as the basis for outpatient follow-up in several patient groups with chronic and malignant diseases.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Schedules for follow-up of teenagers with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have traditionally been based on providing reassurance, rather than on an estimate of the likelihood of intervening to treat a disease flare. We assessed if a calprotectin-based telemonitoring programme with rapid access to specialist care when need arises could be of benefit for patients with a stable disease course. Methods: In a prospective multicenter trial we randomly assigned teenagers (10-19 years) with quiescent disease at baseline to the telemonitoring or usual care arm. Teenagers assigned to telemonitoring had biannual checks, and received automated email alerts to fill in a symptom score and to send a stool sample for calprotectin measurement between scheduled visits. Teenagers in the usual care group had regular scheduled visits. After 52 weeks of follow-up we evaluated the cumulative incidence of disease flares per group, defined as increased symptoms necessitating therapy intensification. Secondary outcomes included the quality-of-life score at end of study (assessed with IMPACT-III), cost effectiveness from a societal perspective, and predictors of successful telemonitoring. Results: We included 170 participants, 84 assigned to telemonitoring and 86 to usual care. After 52 weeks of follow-up, the percentages of patients with a disease flare were similar in both arms (respectively 33 and 34\%). The quality-of-life score at the end of the study favoured the telemonitoring arm (79 vs 75, P=0.02). Telemonitoring saved €360 per patient annually, provided that patients responded to at least 80\% of the automated alerts. A higher emotional quotient and living further away from the hospital were predictors of better compliance to the telemonitoring programme. Conclusions: Calprotectin-assisted telemonitoring of teenagers with IBD seems as effective and safe as traditional care. Better disease specific quality-of-life and lower costs make this telemedicine solution the preferred strategy for monitoring teenagers with a stable disease course.},

	abstract = {Background: Tele-ICU monitoring in Progressive Care Units (TPCU) is expected to provide high standard of care at a lower cost without negatively impacting patient outcomes. We studied the effect of tele-monitoring on hospital mortality and direct costs among patients admitted with a diagnosis of any cardiovascular disease (CVD) in general, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in particular. Methods: We performed a retrospective study at five large hospitals in South Florida region. All adult patients, who were admitted in PCUs between Dec 2011 and Aug 2016, without a prior ICU admission, and with CVD were eligible. Mortality was compared between TPCU vs without tele-monitoring PCU (NTPCU). Patients were admitted to TPCU or NTPCU based on SCCM and hospital guidelines. HR were calculated for hospital mortality and GLMM was used for estimating difference in direct cost. Results: This study included a total of 4705 patients, NTPCU admissions were 1796 (38.2\%) and 2909 (61.8\%) were admitted to TPCUs (Table). We observed 152 (3.3\%) total deaths and lower mortality among patients in TPCU vs NTPCU (p = 0.03). Accounting for demographics, disease severity, patients in the TPCU had 29\% better survival (p = 0.03) compared to the NTPCU group. In the analysis restricted to AMI diagnosis (n = 1156), patients in the TPCU had 54\% (p = 0.02) better survival compared to the NTPCU group with no difference in direct costs between two groups. Among surviving patients, there was no difference in hospital LOS (p {\textgreater} 0.05), and average unadjusted direct cost (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusion: We found overall better hospital survival among TPCU patients with CVD related diagnosis, including those with AMI. Only a few step down ICU or PCU units are remotely monitored in the US; evidence from the current study suggests that TPCUs may decrease mortality, and length of stay within the step-down setting with no significant increase in direct costs. Tele- ICU in step down units will benefit critically ill patients' survival. (Figure Presented).},

	abstract = {Background: Telemedicine is an emerging tool for patients, physicians, and medical systems, offering the ability to revolutionize the delivery of medicine Pediatric Gastroenterology Services tend to be located in urban academic centers or Children's Hospitals, complicating access to care for children living in remote areas. Telemedicine may bridge this gap, enabling tertiary medical facility based providers to expand their care beyond their immediate footprint. Telemedicine additionally offers the ability to reduce work time missed by parents to take care of their sick child, the number one reason why parents are absent from work. Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) is a tertiary referral center for over 200,000 military dependents in Europe. In September 2017 a Pediatric Gastroenterology service was established at LRMC, with the mission to expand Pediatric Gastroenterology services to military dependents across Europe, many of whom live in remote medically underserved areas. Telemedicine offered an avenue for the initial evaluation and continued care for this geographically dispersed population. This study seeks to delineate the characteristics and medical conditions of Pediatric Gastroenterology patients seen via Telemedicine, determine the utility of Telemedicine, and fnally determine cost savings for travel within a single medical system. Methods: 117 consecutive Telemedicine visits by a single Pediatric Gastroenterologist at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) in Landstuhl, Germany were reviewed. The same physician assessed the utility of the Telemedicine visit, along with the quality of the Telemedicine connection using a standardized connectivity scale. Finally, travel cost savings and missed parental work days avoided were calculated. Results: 70 patients with an average age of 7 years (1 month to 21 years) were seen for 117 patient visits (63 initial visits, 54 follow-up visits) via Telemedicine from September 2016 through April 2017. Patients were seen from Germany (88\%), Italy (6\%), Belgium (5\%), Zambia (1\%), and Tajikistan(1\%). Telemedicine streamlined patient care for 44\% of patients. 22\% of patients underwent a trial of care before an in-person visit, and 19\% of initial patient visits required no further care after their initial Telemedicine evaluation. 12\% of telemedicine visits directly lead to an endoscopic procedure. The most common diagnosis from a Telemedicine visit was for Eosinophilic Esophagitis (15\%); 31\% of patients were diagnosed with a functional condition via Telemedicine. The use of Telemedicine in lieu of an in-person visit saved Regional Health Command-Europe \$64,643 in travel reimbursement costs and 190.5 lost parental work days were avoided by using Telemedicine rather than in-person visits. Connectivity was primarily 'good' (66\%), followed by 'fair' (27\%), 'excellent' (3\%) or 'poor' (3\%). Discussion: Telemedicine improves access to care for Pediatric Gastroenterology patients by streamlining in-person visits for geographically dispersed patients. Specifcally, this study demonstrates how Pediatric Gastroenterologists can streamline patient care through Telemedicine by ordering additional laboratory testing before a patient is seen in person, and in coordinating for a procedure for a patient who is traveling from afar, limiting time away from home and work for families. Although streamlining care was the primary utility of Telemedicine, the greatest beneft for Pediatric Gastroenterology patients may lie in the care of children with chronic medical conditions. Children with eosinophilic disorders are high utilizers of specialty care, and in this study they composed 18\% of all Telemedicine visits. Enabling these visits to take place in from the comfort of their home diminishes missed school time for children, missed work time for parents, and overall expedites patient care. Additionally, a surprising amount of patients required no further follow-up beyond an initial consultation. Connectivity was overall satisfactory with few visits unable to be completed due to connection diffculties; with continued improvements in connectivity, the quality of connections will increase with time. Finally, there are signifcant savings in both the direct fnancial costs for travel and in decreasing parental absenteeism for their child's illness. Future areas for research include comparing outcomes from patients seen via Telemedicine versus in-person care, and in further identifying patient populations best served and not served by this modality of care. As geographically dispersed patients become increasingly 'on-line', Telemedicine offers an avenue for Pediatric Gastroenterologists to expand their reach beyond notional boundaries.},

	abstract = {Background: Finding innovative and cost-efficient care strategies that induce long-term health benefits in cardiac patients constitutes a big challenge today. The aim of this Telerehab III follow-up study was to assess whether a 6-month additional cardiac telerehabilitation programme could induce long-term health benefits and remain cost-efficient after the tele-intervention ended. Methods and results: A total of 126 cardiac patients first completed the multicentre, randomised controlled telerehabilitation trial (Telerehab III, time points t0 to t1). They consequently entered the follow-up study (t1) with evaluations 2 years later (t2). A quantitative analysis of peak aerobic capacity (VO2 peak, primary endpoint), international physical activity questionnaire self-reported physical activity and HeartQoL quality of life (secondary endpoints) was performed. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. Even though a decline in VO2 peak (24 ± 8 ml/[min*kg] at t1 and 22 ± 6 ml/[min*kg] at t2; P ≤ 0.001) was observed within the tele-intervention group patients; overall they did better than the no tele-intervention group (P = 0.032). Dividing the incremental cost (−€878/patient) by the differential incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (0.22 QALYs) yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of –€3993/QALY. Conclusions: A combined telerehabilitation and centre-based programme, followed by transitional telerehabilitation induced persistent health benefits and remained cost-efficient up to 2 years after the end of the intervention. A partial decline of the benefits originally achieved did occur once the tele-intervention ended. Healthcare professionals should reflect on how innovative cost-efficient care models could be implemented in standard care. Future research should focus on key behaviour change techniques in technology-based interventions that enable full persistence of long-term behaviour change and health benefits.

It is also easy to make the connection that many post-hospital discharge surgical complications, including surgical site infections (SSIs), could be influenced or exacerbated by patient comorbidities. The authors of a recent study reported that female gender, obesity, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dyspnea, and neurologic disease were significant predictors of SSIs after vascular reconstruction was performed. The main concern for optimal patient care, especially in geographically isolated areas of West Virginia, is to have early, expeditious, and prompt diagnosis of complications and SSI. This adjunct to existing approaches could lead to improved outcomes and patient satisfaction, minimizing third-party interventions and decreasing the total cost of care. It seems reasonable to believe that monitoring using telehealth technology and managing the general health care of patients after a hospital vascular intervention will improve overall health and reduce 30-day readmissions and SSIs.},

Methods We constructed a randomized parallel group study of suitable patients attending our Epilepsy Clinic and compared telephonic review with conventional clinic visit based management. Primary outcomes were the percentage of patients with breakthrough seizures and total number of breakthrough seizures. We also compared cost, patient satisfaction and numbers defaulting. Results A total of 465 patients were randomized and 429 were included in the final analysis. There was no significant difference in breakthrough seizures between the two groups. Mean time spent in the consultation was 10 min in the telephone group (FT) and 22 h in the face-to-face group (FC) and cost was INR 865 more expensive on an average in the FC group. Satisfaction was over 90\% in the FT group. Significantly more people in the FC group were lost to follow-up. Conclusion This study provides Class I evidence that the number of stable epilepsy patients who have breakthrough seizures and the total number of breakthrough seizures remain the same irrespective of whether patients are reviewed telephonically or face-to-face in the clinic. Clinicians managing epilepsy patients should consider using telephonic review for selected patients. Telephonic reviews have the potential of effectively reducing the secondary treatment gap in millions of patients who do not have easy access to doctors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Untreated Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) can lead to high morbidity, such as reduced cognitive function and increased risk of accidents, and it is associated with diseases such as systemic arterial hypertension, metabolic syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke. Multimorbidity implies to change organization of care and follow-up. Objective: We prospectively assessed adherence using daily telemonitoring of naïve Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) OSA patients data and other associated clinical parameters of cardio-metabolic risk during six months. The ultimate goal of this pilot trial will be to develop an effective, extensible and cost-effective system to promote improved adherence to CPAP patients, as well as monitor clinical parameters (HR, hypertension, glycaemia, and oximetry) of frequently associated OSA co-morbidities. Materials and methods: In a single center, 33 naïve PAP adult patients with moderate to severe OSA were randomized in two groups: standard care consisting in first week and weekly, if necessary, first, third and sixth month consultations and those with daily telemonitoring information (i.e., adherence, air leak, residual AHI) plus standard care. If problems were identified from information from the website, the patientwas contacted by telephone and eventually by a consultation of a homecare technician. Subjects who used PAP for at least 6 hours per night for at least 90\% of the days monitored were regarded as adherent. We also analyzed the correlation between adherence and cardio-metabolic clinical parameters. Results: 32 patients were enrolled, 16 were randomized to telemedicine and 17 to standard care. The mean age was 56, 2 yr., mean AHI was 39, 4 events/hr., and 57\% of patients were male. Only after 1 month, mean PAP adherence was significantly greater in the telemedicine arm versus the standard arm. After 3 mo. PAP adherence in the telemedicine arm was almost total sleep time (7h34) versus 5h58 in the standard arm. But after 6 months, there was no difference between the two groups. Additionally, we analyzed cardio-metabolic clinical parameters with PAP adherence and independent predictors of PAP adherence. Conclusions: Early PAP adherence can be improved with the use of a webbased telemedicine system at the beginning of the treatment. Standard Care implied much more resources and time-consuming. This trial demonstrates that good PAP adherence occurs during the first few days and was predicted by the correction of the interface problems in the first two weeks of treatment, greater AHI, severity as measured by both AHI and TC90, greater Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, greater Body Mass Index (BMI) and by the presence of comorbidities as hypertension and diabetes at baseline. Cardio-metabolic diseases and inherent clinical parameters significantly improved with total sleep time PAP adherence associated with body mass control and an exercise regular program.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: On-site hospitalist care can improve patient care, but it is economically infeasible for small critical access hospitals (CAHs). A telemedicine “virtual hospitalist” may expand CAH capabilities at a fractional cost of an on-site provider. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a virtual hospitalist on transfers from a CAH to outside hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A six-month pilot program providing “virtual hospitalist” coverage to patients at a CAH in rural Iowa. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the rate of outside transfers from the CAH Emergency Department (ED). The secondary outcomes included transfer from either the ED or the inpatient wards, daily census, length of stay, transfers after admission, virtual hospitalist time commitment, and patient and staff satisfaction. The preceding 24-week baseline was compared with 24 weeks after implementation, excluding a two-week transition period. RESULTS: At baseline, there were 947 ED visits and 176 combined inpatient and observation encounters, compared to 930 and 176 after implementation, respectively. Outside transfers from the ED decreased from 16.6\% to 10.5\% (157/947 to 98/930, P {\textless} .001), and transfers at any time decreased from 17.3\% to 11.9\% (164/947 to 111/930, P {\textless} .001). Daily census, length of stay, and transfers after admission were unchanged. Time commitment for a virtual hospitalist was 35 minutes per patient per day. The intervention was well received by the CAH staff and patients. CONCLUSIONS: The virtual hospitalist model increased the percentage of ED patients who could safely receive their care locally.

Mobile stroke units equipped with CT scanners, also utilizing telestroke have demonstrated a further reduction in door to needle times. Despite the benefits of mobile stroke units, the cost of producing and maintaining these units may be a limiting factor in system-wide adoption of the concept. There is little data examining continuous telestroke support provided by neurologists in the EMS setting. We tested this lower-cost alternative, by providing 24/7 telestroke access to two local EMS providers. We hypothesized that telestroke in the EMS setting would be safe, feasible and reduce door to needle times. Methods: Stroke-specialized neurologists provided continuous (24/7) video-based telestroke access to two local EMS agencies from December 2015 through May 2017 as part of the REACHOUT project. Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Intravenous (IV) tPA door to needle times were compared between patients who were assessed via EMS telestroke to patients assessed by hospital based telestroke in one of the nine hospitals within our telestroke network, during the same time period. Results: Fifty-eight telestroke requests were registered with 52 (89.7\%) successful consultations during the study period. The initial telestroke impression in 42/52 (80.8\%) cases was a possible acute stroke or TIA. There were 142 patients treated with IV tPA via hospital based telestroke encounters and 4 patients were treated with IV tPA after being evaluated via EMS telestroke. A comparison of door to needle times suggested shorter door to needle times in the EMS telestroke group (mean rank 12.8; median 39.5 min) compared to the hospital based telestroke group (mean rank 74.2; median 65.5 min), U = 41, p = .004, r = .24. Conclusions: Despite isolated connectivity issues, we found EMS based telestroke encounters to be safe and feasible. Prehospital evaluation of patients by a stroke-specialized neurologist provided a comprehensive clinical picture to emergency department physicians upon arrival to the hospital. Reduced door to needle times were reported in EMS based telestroke compared to hospital based telestroke.},

	abstract = {Learning Objectives: Telemedicine in intensive care (Tele-ICU) is in its early maturity. Tele-ICU is associated with mortality reduction and enhanced quality. The main objective was to examine the effects of Tele-ICU innovation in Progressive Care Units (TPCU) on hospital mortality, length of stay, and direct cost of PCU cardiology patients. Methods: Concurrent observational matched case control study to evaluate the input of Tele-ICU in PCU with data collected from cardiology patients admitted to PCU between Dec. 2011 and Aug. 2016 across five large hospitals in South Florida. Bivariate statistics were calculated for LOS and hospital mortality rates stratified by TPCU and NTPCU status. Cox-proportion survival analyses were conducted to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for hospital mortality. HR were adjusted for hospital, demographics, organ systems, APR-DRG disease severity, and APR-DRG risk of mortality. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used for estimating differences in direct cost of hospitalization between two groups. Results: Total sample of PCU patients (n = 4705), 152 (3.3\%) total deaths observed. TPCU (n = 2909, 61.8\%) were compared with patients admitted to PCU without Tele-ICU (NTPCU) (n = 1796, 38.2\%). TPCU patients had a lower mortality compared to NTPCU (p = 0.03) and a 29\% better survival (p = 0.03) while controlling for demographics and severity of illness. Among the most frequently occurring cardiology illnesses, Acute MI (n = 1156), patients in the TPCU had 54\% (p = 0.02) better survival compared to the NTPCU group with no difference in direct costs between two groups. Among surviving patients, there was no difference in hospital LOS (p{\textgreater} 0.05), and average unadjusted direct cost (p{\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusions: Our study provides evidence of the association of optimal patient centered outcomes when TPCU is applied specifically to PCU cardiology patients. We found overall better hospital survival among TPCU patients with CVD related diagnosis, including those with AMI. These are new results of positive benefits for mortality and survival without an additional cost incurrence in a specialty population.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Increasing incidence and prevalence of diabetes are a major strain on health-care resources. Telehealth can improve traditional care delivery and equitable distribution of health-care services with cost-efficiencies. This is relevant for overcoming geographical barriers in a country like Australia. This study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of patients attending a tertiary hospital (Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia) diabetes telehealth service (DTS) with specialist face-to-face diabetes outpatient service (DOS). Method: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken as part of the well-established Australian National Diabetes Audit in May 2016 (focussed on patient education and self-management practices) and May 2017 (focussed on clinical management practices). Corresponding data from the two surveys were combined and analysed. Results: 284 and 62 diabetes patients were surveyed in the DOS and DTS groups respectively. In the DOS group, 179 (63.0\%) were type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and 98 (34.5\%) were type 1 diabetes (T1DM). 44 (71.0\%) DTS patients had T2DM and 15 (24.2\%) were T1DM. There was no statistical difference between groups (DOS Vs DTS) in HbA1c, when analysed for T2DM (8.2\%-66mmol/mol Vs 8.7\%-72mmol/mol) and T1DM (8.3\%-67mmol/mol Vs 9.0\%-95mmol/mol); in the proportion of patients achieving HbA1c less than 8\%(64mmol/mol); and in the proportion of diabetes treatment methods. Among T2DM patients, there was a statistically significant higher proportion of indigenous patients in DTS group(31.8\% Vs 1.1\%). Initial visits were higher in DTS group. Conclusion: This analysis reveals similar clinical outcomes in glycaemic management among T1DM and T2DM patients in both DOS and DTS groups. As the DTS delivers services in regional Queensland, Australia, it provides a valuable service to patients in underserved areas.},

	abstract = {Disablement affects over 40\% of patients with advanced stage cancer, devastates their quality of life (QoL), and increases their healthcare costs. Proactively treating the causes of disablement; physical impairments, pain, and immobility, can prolong functional independence, improve QoL and, potentially, reduce utilization. However rehabilitation service delivery models are reactive in nature and focus on catastrophic rather than incipient disability. A validated collaborative approach, the Three Component Model (TCM), optimizes important clinical outcomes and may provide an ideal framework to overcome barriers to proactively integrating rehabilitation into cancer care. A novel expansion of the TCM that targets disablement by engaging local physical therapists to address physical impairments and immobility, the TCM-Rehabilitation Services (TCM-RS), benefits and is well received by patients. However, its effectiveness has not been rigorously assessed. The 3-arm randomized COllaborative Care to Preserve PErformance in Cancer (COPE) Trial compared: 1) enhanced usual care, 2) rehabilitation services targeting physical impairments and immobility via the TCM-RS, and 3) TCM-RS plus conventional TCM pain management TCM-RS + Pain. Of the 516 participants, those randomized to arms 2 and 3 underwent an initial 4-week intervention period and were then followed for 6 months with remote monitoring and monthly telephone calls. The trial's primary outcome, functional status, and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Utilization was abstracted from clinical records. By estimating the effectiveness and cost-utility implications of the TCM-RS and TCM-RS + Pain, COPE will inform future delivery research, practice and policy in the means to reduce disablement in chronically diseased populations.},

Our objective is to enable recovery and improve quality of life following a hip fracture through the development and implementation of the HIP Mobile e- Monitoring and Coaching system. Methods: Our interdisciplinary team partnered with Greybox Solutions for the development of the HIP Mobile technology. A trial was initiated to determine if this technology is more effective at improving mobility in adults 60 years and older with a recent hip fracture than a printed material support program. Results: HIP Mobile is an e-Monitoring and Coaching support program, comprised of a wearable sensor- a smart insole for the shoe- with a tablet based app interface and a secure cloud based remote monitoring dashboard. Expert educational content (user guides, 6-level exercise program to be followed at home, and post-intervention exercise program), exercise-tracking algorithms and a patient-oriented interface have been piloted, validated and formatted for the electronic and printed versions and translated in French. Recruitment is ongoing for a randomized clinical trial with parallel groups with the primary outcome of functional mobility (as measured by gait speed and 30-second sit-to-stand activity) 6 months following hip fracture. Patient-reported outcomes and place of residence have been collected throughout the trial and persistence of effect will be determined at 12 months. Conclusion: Our interactive HIP Mobile e-system encourages active engagement in the rehabilitation process following a hip fracture and has the potential to improve functional mobility and autonomy at reduced costs. If successful, such technology could be harnessed towards a variety of rehabilitation processes.},

We compared differences between groups in the rate of daytime ambulatory blood pressure normalization ({\textless}130/80 mmHg), need of treatment changes during follow-up, quality of life scores, and healthcare costs. Results: Baseline office blood pressures were 149 ± 12/89 ± 9 and 148 ± 13/89 ± 7 mmHg in groups A (n = 111) and B (n = 187) respectively, the corresponding daytime values being 140 ± 11/84 ± 8 and 139 ± 11/84 ± 8 mmHg.

Several investigations support the usefulness of programs of disease management for improving clinical outcomes. However, the effect of home-based telemanagement programs on the rate of hospital readmission is still unclear and the cost-effectiveness ratio of such programs is unknown. The aim of the study was to determine whether a home-based telemanagement (HBT) programme in CHF patients decreased hospital readmissions and hospital costs in comparison with the usual care (UC) follow-up programme over a one-year period. Methods and results: Four hundred-sixty CHF patients (pts), aged 57 ± 10 years were randomised to two management strategies: 230 pts to HBT programme and 230 pts to UC programme. The HBT pts received a portable device, transferring, by telephone, a one-lead trace to a receiving station where a nurse was available for interactive teleconsultation. The UC pts were referred to their primary care physicians and cardiologists. The primary objective of the study was one-year hospital readmission for cardiovascular reasons. During one-year follow-up 55 pts (24\%) in HBT group and 83 pts (36\%) in UC group had at least one readmission (RR = 0.56; 95\% CI: 0.38-0.82; p = 0.01). After adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics, the HBT group had a significantly lower risk of readmission compared with the UC group (HR = 0.50, 95\% CI: 0.34-0.73; p = 0.01). The intervention was associated with a 36\% decrease in the total number of hospital readmissions (HBT group: 91 readmissions; UC group: 142 readmissions) and a 31\% decrease in the total number of episodes of hemodynamic instability (101 in HBT group vs 147 in UC group). The rate of hearth failure-related readmission was 19\% (43 pts) in HBT group and 32\% (73 pts) in UC group (RR = 0.49, 95\% [CI]: 0.31-0.76; p = 0.0001). No significant difference was found on cardiovascular mortality between groups. Mean cost for hospital readmission was significantly lower in HBT group (€ 843 +/- 1733) than in UC group (€ 1298 +/- 2322), (- 35\%, p {\textless} 0.01).

Telemonitoring can identify worsening heart failure but previous randomized trials have enrolled selected patient populations. The Home-HF study examined the impact of home telemonitoring on typical heart failure patients discharged from three acute hospitals in North West London, UK.Methods and resultsPatients hospitalized with heart failure were randomized to telemonitoring or usual specialist care. Primary outcome measures were days alive and out of hospital. Secondary outcome measures were number and duration of heart failure hospitalizations, clinic visits, and quality of life. We recruited 182 patients. There was no difference in the primary outcome measure in the two groups, but there were significantly fewer unplanned hospitalizations for heart failure decompensation, and a reduction in clinic and emergency room visits in the telemonitoring group. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean direct health service costs.ConclusionHome telemonitoring in a typical elderly population of heart failure patients produces a similar outcome to 'usual' specialist care, but reduces clinic and emergency room visits and unplanned heart failure rehospitalizations at little additional cost. This method of disease monitoring may allow specialist services to increase the number of patients under their care.},

	abstract = {Background: Older adults who live in rural areas experience significant disparities in health status and access to mental health care. "Telepsychology," (also referred to as "telepsychiatry," or "telemental health") represents a potential strategy towards addressing this longstanding problem. Older adults may benefit from telepsychology due to its: (1) utility to address existing problematic access to care for rural residents; (2) capacity to reduce stigma associated with traditional mental health care; and (3) utility to overcome significant age-related problems in ambulation and transportation. Moreover, preliminary evidence indicates that telepsychiatry programs are often less expensive for patients, and reduce travel time, travel costs, and time off from work. Thus, telepsychology may provide a cost-efficient solution to access-to-care problems in rural areas. Methods We describe an ongoing four-year prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of an empirically supported treatment for major depressive disorder, Behavioral Activation, delivered either via in-home videoconferencing technology ("Telepsychology") or traditional face-to-face services ("Same-Room"). Our hypothesis is that in-homeTelepsychology service delivery will be equally effective as the traditional mode (Same-Room). Two-hundred twenty-four (224) male and female elderly participants will be administered protocol-driven individual Behavioral Activation therapy for depression over an 8-week period; and subjects will be followed for 12-months to ascertain longer-term effects of the treatment on three outcomes domains: (1) clinical outcomes (symptom severity, social functioning); (2) process variables (patient satisfaction, treatment credibility, attendance, adherence, dropout); and (3) economic outcomes (cost and resource use). Discussion: Results from the proposed study will provide important insight into whether telepsychology service delivery is as effective as the traditional mode of service delivery, defined in terms of clinical, process, and economic outcomes, for elderly patients with depression residing in rural areas without adequate access to mental health services. © 2009 Egede et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Self-management strategies improve a variety of health-related outcomes for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These strategies, however, are primarily designed to improve chronic disease management and have not focused on early detection and early treatment of exacerbations. In COPD, the majority of exacerbations go unreported and treatment is frequently delayed, resulting in worsened outcomes. Therefore, a randomised clinical trial was designed to determine whether integration of self-management education with proactive remote disease monitoring would improve health-related outcomes. A total of 40 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage 3 or 4 COPD patients were randomised to receive proactive integrated care (PIC) or usual care (UC) over a 3-month period. The primary and secondary outcomes were change in quality of life, measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and change in healthcare costs. PIC dramatically improved SGRQ by 10.3 units, compared to 0.6 units in the UC group. Healthcare costs declined in the PIC group by US\$1,401, compared with an increase of US\$1,709 in the UC group, but this was not statistically significant. PIC uncovered nine exacerbations, seven of which were unreported. Therefore, proactive integrated care has the potential to improve outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients through effects of self-management, as well as early detection and treatment of exacerbations.

Few studies have considered the acceptability, benefits, and barriers perceived by clients involved in the use of technology. The purpose of this study was to discover perceptions about ease of use, efficacy, and difficulties encountered by patients who used an in-home telehealth communication device, the Health Buddy. METHODS: Thirteen participants were selected from a parent study in which they used the Health Buddy. Focus groups and individual interviews were the data collection methods. Content analysis was used to answer the research questions. RESULTS: Participants found that the Health Buddy is technologically easy to use; that it promoted, taught, and supported heart failure self-management; and that it was even a "lifesaver," but that it could be bothersome, complex, and too lengthy an intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth, a cost-effective way to promote improved health management, is suitable to most patients. Minor adjustments in management will be needed to accommodate individual preferences to increase satisfaction.},

	abstract = {Objective: A number of effective treatments for bulimia nervosa have been developed, but they are infrequently used, in part due to problems with dissemination. The goal of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of telemedicine delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa. Method: A randomized controlled trial of face-to-face versus telemedicine cognitive behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa. One hundred twenty eight women with DSM-IV bulimia nervosa or eating disorder, not otherwise specified subsyndromal variants of bulimia nervosa were randomized to 20 sessions of treatment over 16 weeks. A cost effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective was conducted. Results: The total cost per recovered (abstinent) subject was \$9324.68 for face-to-face CBT, and \$7300.40 for telemedicine CBT. The cost differential was accounted for largely by therapist travel costs. Sensitivity analyses examining therapy session costs, gasoline costs and telemedicine connection costs yielded fundamentally similar results. Discussion: In this study, CBT delivered face-to-face and via telemedicine were similarly effective, and telemedicine delivery cost substantially less. These findings underscore the potential applicability of telemedicine approaches to eating disorder treatment and psychiatric treatment in general. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Telemedicine provides patients with easy and remote access to consultant expertise irrespective of geographic location. In a randomized controlled trial, this study has applied a rigorous costing methodology to the use of telemedicine in chronic pain management. Methods: We performed a randomized two-period crossover trial comparing in-person (IP) consultation with telemedicine (TM) consultation in the management of chronic pain. Over an 18-month period, 26 patients each completed two diaries capturing their direct and indirect travel costs, daily pain scores, and satisfaction with physician consultation. Costing models were developed to account for direct, indirect, fixed, and variable costs in order to perform break-even analyses. Sensitivity analysis was performed over a broad range of assumptions. Results: Direct patient costs were significantly lower in the TM group than in the IP group, with median cost and interquartile range \$133 (28-377) vs \$443 (292-1075), respectively (P = 0.001). More patients were highly satisfied with the TM consultation than with the IP consultation (56 and 24\%, respectively; P {\textless} 0.05). Break-even annual patient volume was estimated at 57 patients. A two-way sensitivity analysis controlling for annual patient volume and round-trip distance indicated that TM remains cost-effective at volumes {\textgreater}50 patients/year or at round-trip distances {\textgreater}200 km. Conclusion: Telemedicine is cost-effective over a broad range of assumptions, including annual patient volumes, travel distance, fuel costs, amortization, and discount rates.

PTSD is a prevalent mental health problem found among returning Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) military populations. These returning military personnel often live in rural areas and therefore have limited access to care and specialized psychological treatments. In the field of mental health, telemental health (TMH) technology has introduced a potential solution to the persistent problem of access to care in remote areas. This study is enrolling approximately 126 returning veterans with current combat-related PTSD who are receiving services through the Veteran Administration (VA) mental health care clinics on 4 Hawaiian Islands. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), an empirically supported manualized treatment for PTSD, is being delivered across 9 cohorts. Participants are assigned to either the experimental VTC condition or the in-person control condition. Assessments measuring clinical, process, and cost outcomes are being conducted at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3 and 6 months post-treatment. The study employs a noninferiority design to determine if the group treatment delivered via VTC is as good as the traditional in-person modality. In addition, a cost analysis will be performed in order to compare the cost of the 2 modalities. Novel aspects of this trial and specific challenges are discussed. © 2009.},

PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: One hundred three subjects with 160 pressure ulcers (PrUs) or nonhealing surgical wounds referred to a metropolitan Visiting Nurse Agency. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Group A (n = 40): weekly visits with TM and wound care specialist (WCS) consults; group B (n = 28): weekly visits with weekly consults with WCSs; and group C (n = 35): usual and customary care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were time to heal, costs, length of stay (LOS), nursing visits, wound status, and change in size. RESULTS: There was a similar distribution of subject characteristics in all 3 groups, but group A had disproportionally larger and more numerous PrUs and larger nonhealing surgical wounds. Group A had increased time to heal, LOS, costs, and visits compared with groups B and C; wound status was similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Uneven distribution of severity and type of wounds among groups, with greatest percentage of large wounds in TM group. Larger wounds consume more resources. TM is a useful communication tool in wound management but with limited power when randomization does not include wound size or type. Two important benchmarks were established for home care. First, it took 51 days, on average, to heal or improve PrUs and 34 days to heal or improve surgical wounds regardless of group. Second, nearly 90\% of wounds improved or healed.},

	abstract = {Background Nonadherence, inadequate monitoring, and side-effects result in suboptimal outcomes in ulcerative colitis (UC). We hypothesize that telemanagement for UC will improve symptoms, quality of life, adherence, and decrease costs. Purpose This article describes the challenges encountered in the design of the home telemanagement in patients with UC trial. Methods In a randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of telemanagement for UC compared to best available care, 100 patients will be enrolled. Subjects in the intervention arm will complete self-testing with telemanagement weekly; best available care subjects will receive scheduled follow up, educational fact sheets, and written action plans. Telemanagement consists of a home-unit, decision support server, and web-based clinician portal. The home-unit includes a scale and laptop. Subjects will respond to questions about symptoms, side-effects, adherence, and knowledge weekly; subjects will receive action plans after self-testing. Outcome variables to be assessed every 4 months include: disease activity, using the Seo index; quality of life, using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire; adherence, using pharmacy refill data and the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale; utilization of healthcare resources, using urgent care visits and hospitalizations. Results We encountered several challenges during design and implementation of our trial. First, we selected a randomized controlled trial design. We could have selected a quasiexperimental design to decrease the sample size needed and costs. Second, identification of a control group was challenging. Telemanagement patients received self-care plans and an educational curriculum. Since controls would not receive these interventions, we thought our results would be biased in favor of telemanagement. In addition, we wanted to evaluate the mode of delivery of these components of care. Therefore, we included written action plans and educational materials for patients in the control group ('best available care'). Third, we could not blind subjects to group assignment. In an attempt to decrease bias, staff was masked to group assignment to decrease measurement bias. Fourth, we selected outcome measures that were not invasive to decrease risks to subjects and to enhance recruitment. Limitations Our results may not be generalizable as our program is a tertiary center. Further, subjects are not blinded to the intervention potentially resulting in bias; we attempt to minimize this bias by having staff masked to treatment group at the time of assessment of outcome measures. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, our trial will be the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate telemedicine in subjects with gastrointestinal disease. We describe several issues encountered in design and implementation of our trial that will aid investigators when planning telemedicine trials in inflammatory bowel disease.},

Design We studied 1665 participants in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine (IDEATel), a randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine case management of diabetes to usual care. Participants were aged 55 years or older, and resided in federally designated medically underserved areas of New York State. Measurements We analyzed Medicare claims payments for each participant for up to 60 study months from date of randomization, until their death, or until December 31, 2006 (whichever happened first). We also analyzed study expenditures for the telemedicine intervention over six budget years (February 28, 2000e February 27, 2006). Results Mean annual Medicare payments (SE) were similar in the usual care and telemedicine groups, \$9040 (\$386) and \$9669 (\$443) per participant, respectively (p{\textgreater}0.05). Sensitivity analyses, including stratification by censored status, adjustment by enrollment site, and semi-parametric weighting by probability of dropping-out, rendered similar results. Over six budget years 28 821 participant/months of telemedicine intervention were delivered, at an estimated cost of \$622 per participant/ month. Conclusion Telemedicine case management was not associated with a reduction in Medicare claims in this medically underserved population. The cost of implementing the telemedicine intervention was high, largely representing special purpose hardware and software costs required at the time. Lower implementation costs will need to be achieved using lower cost technology in order for telemedicine case management to be more widely used.},

METHODS AND POPULATION: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial comparing the clinical course of psoriasis patients followed in telemedicine clinic with those receiving traditional in-office care. Following an initial baseline visit, sixty-two subjects were randomized in a 1:1 non-stratified fashion to continue follow up either in-person or on-line. Clinically validated, disease-specific measures including the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), Investigator Global Assessment, and Dermatology Life Quality Index were assessed in-person at the baseline and outcome visits for all patients. The study had a 90\% power to detect a minimal clinically relevant mean difference of 2.5 points in the PASI, the primary outcome measure, with a standard deviation of 3 and an alpha of 0.05. RESULTS: We anticipate that compared to traditional in-office care the online care model will result in similar improvements in psoriasis disease severity, quality of life and patient satisfaction. SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY: Studies suggest that teledermatology may improve patient satisfaction, reduce costs and improve access to dermatologic specialty care. The diagnostic accuracy and reliability of teledermatolgoy is similar to conventional care; however, comparability of clinical outcomes has not been well studied. Rigorous clinical outcomes research utilizing validated disease-specific measures is required if this innovative health care delivery model is to be incorporated into standard clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Remote monitoring is increasingly becoming the new standard of care for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) follow-up. We sought to determine whether remote monitoring of ICDs improves patient outcomes compared with quarterly device interrogations in clinic. Methods and Results: In this single-center pilot clinical trial, adult patients with an ICD were randomly assigned to remote monitoring versus quarterly device interrogations in clinic. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular hospitalization, emergency room visit for a cardiac cause, and unscheduled visit to the electrophysiology clinic for a device-related issue at 1 year. We also examined health-related quality of life, costs, and patient satisfaction with their ICD care. Of 151 patients enrolled in this trial, 76 were randomized to remote monitoring and 75 to quarterly device interrogations in clinic. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint (32\% in the remote monitoring arm vs 34\% in the control arm; P = 0.8), mortality, or cost between the 2 arms. Quality of life and patient satisfaction were significantly better in the control arm than in the remote monitoring arm at 6 months (83 [25th, 75th percentiles 70, 90] vs 75 [50, 85]; P = 0.002 and 88 [75, 100] vs 75 [75, 88]; P = 0.03, respectively), but not at 12 months. Conclusion: We showed no significant reduction in cardiac-related resource utilization with remote monitoring of ICDs. However, given the small number of patients in our study, the real clinical and health economics impact of remote monitoring needs to be verified by a large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation programs at health care facilities are effective but under-used. Telephone quit lines provide easy access but only a small portion of smokers contact quit lines for help. Costeffective methods are needed to increase use of smoking-cessation care. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial enrolled 836 veterans at five VA medical centers from June, 2001 to December, 2002. The telephonecare group received behavioral counseling by telephone and medications by mail. Usual care consisted of standard treatment at VA medical centers. At 12 months participants were assessed for continuous abstinence over the prior sixmonths. Clinical resultspublished earlier revealedsignificantly greater long-termabstinence in the telephone-care group (13.0\%vs. 4.1\%). The present study determined the relative cost-effectiveness of telephone care from the VA perspective over a lifetime horizon. There were 819 usable observations. Case report forms captured demographic information, clinical data, and 12-monthoutcomes. Use and cost of VA services during the 12months after enrollment were extracted fromthe VA Decision Support System. VA Fee Basis files were searched for care purchased by VA from outside vendors. Intervention costs were derived through micro-costing. Our primary outcome was cost per life-year gained. We assumed 1.2 life years per quit based on a recent international review. An initial intent-totreat analysis treated decedents and persons lost to follow-up assmokers.A second analysis excluded the 15 decedents because no deaths were studyrelated. The final analysis employed regression-based multiple imputation to complete missing values of smoking abstinence based on baseline characteristics, again excluding decedents. We used bootstrapping to determine the 95th percentile of costs per life-year. Cost figures are reported in 2008 dollars. Discounting was deemed unnecessary due to the short study timeframe. All analyses were carried out in Stata 10. RESULTS: The intervention cost \$123 (s.d. \$31) per person on average. Mean total cost of all VA care received during the study period was \$6,210 (\$14,329) in the telephone-care arm and \$5,776 (\$12,841) in usual care (n.s.). Inpatient and outpatient costs were both greater in the intervention arm but differences were never significant at conventional levels. Under the intent-to-treat analysis the average cost per quit was \$5,667, or \$4,723 per life-year. Ninety-five percent of bootstrapped values fell at≤\$21,300 per life-year. Excluding decedents raised the 95\% threshold to≤\$22,300 but applying multiple imputation lowered it to ≤ \$19,000. CONCLUSIONS: The telephone care intervention is cost-effective by conventional standards. Under a conservative assumption of 0.50 utility for life-years gained, the telephone-care intervention would still fall below \$50,000 per QALY. We assume no cost difference between arms after 12 months in present discounted value. This is conservative because smokers incur greater costs for many years. We also assume that relapsers are exactly offset by new quitters after 12months. A sensitivity analysiswill vary these assumptions. Recent research showed that treating people with missing outcomes as smokers is not necessarily conservative. In our study using multiple imputation raised clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. This approach should be treated as the standard for smoking-cessation trials.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Self management of hypertension including self monitoring and self titration of antihypertensives is a novel intervention aiming to improve blood pressure control. Very little evidence exists regarding the cost effectiveness of self monitoring of blood pressure in general and self management in particular. This study aimed to evaluate whether self management of hypertension was cost effective. Methods: The telemonitoring and self-management in hypertension trial (TASMINH2) was a primary care based randomised controlled trial comparing home monitoring of blood pressure with telemonitoring and self titration of anti hypertensive medication to usual care in people with poorly controlled hypertension. An embedded economic evaluation ran parallel to the main trial. It took a base case ofcosts from a UK Health Service perspective and analysed both cost per reduction in unit blood pressure and costs per QALY. Sensitivity analyses examined cost effectiveness from a societal point of view as well as evaluating the effect of missing values, different assumptions and bias due to high cost patients. Results: Self management of hypertension with telemonitoring was cost effective with an ICER for blood pressure reduction of £19/mm Hg (€15/mm Hg) - implying that using self management with telemonitoring and titration of antihypertensive medication to reduce systolic BP by 1 mm Hg costs on average £19 (€15). In terms of quality of life, compared to usual care, using self management with telemonitoring and titration of antihypertensive medication was associated with a gain of 0.0179 QALYs translat ing into a mean cost of just over £5,600 (€4,462) per QALY gained. There was an 85\% chance of this being cost effective given a willingness to pay of £20,000 (€15,936) per QALY gained. This result was robust to sensitivity analysis around the assumptions made including from a societal perspective and removing high cost patients. Conclusions: Self monitoring with self titration of antihypertensives and telemonitoring of blood pressure measurements is cost effective as well as leading to reduced blood pressure.},

	abstract = {Context: Collaborative care interventions for depression in primary care settings are clinically beneficial and cost-effective. Most prior studies were conducted in urban settings. Objective: To examine the cost-effectiveness of a rural telemedicine-based collaborative care depression intervention. Design: Randomized contolled trial of intervention vs usual care. Setting: Seven small (serving 1000 to 5000 veterans) Veterans Health Administration community-based outpatient clinics serving rural catchment areas in 3 mid-South states. Each site had interactive televideo dedicated to mental health but no psychiatrist or psychologist on site. Patients: Among 18 306 primary care patients whowere screened, 1260 (6.9\%) screened positive for depression; 395 met eligibility criteria and were enrolled from April 2003 to September 2004. Of those enrolled, 360 (91.1\%) completed a 6-month follow-up and 335 (84.8\%) completed a 12-month follow-up. Intervention: A stepped-care model for depression treatment was used by an off-site depression care team to make treatment recommendations via electronic medical record. The team included a nurse depression care manager, clinical pharmacist, and psychiatrist. The depression care manager communicated with patients via telephone and was supported by computerized decision support software. Main Outcome Measures: The base case cost analysis included outpatient, pharmacy, and intervention expenditures. The effectiveness outcomes were depressionfree days and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) calculated using the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey standard gamble conversion formula. Results: The incremental depression-free days outcome was not significant (P=.10); therefore, further costeffectiveness analyses were not done. The incrementalQALY outcome was significant (P=.04) and the mean base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was \$85 634/QALY. Results adding inpatient costs were \$111 999/QALY to \$132 175/QALY. Conclusions: In rural settings, a telemedicine-based collaborative care intervention for depression is effective and expensive. The mean base case result was \$85 634/ QALY, which is greater than cost per QALY ratios reported for other, mostly urban, depression collaborative care interventions. ©2010 American Medical Association.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to measure the ability of telemonitoring to reduce hospital days and total costs for Medicare managed care enrollees diagnosed with heart failure. Patients were recruited and randomly assigned for six months to either telemonitoring or standard care. Telemonitoring transmitted vital signs and clinical alerts daily to a central nursing station. Utilization of covered services was analyzed for the six-month telemonitoring period to test for hypothesized reductions in hospital days and changes in utilization of the emergency department (ED), urgent care, and primary care. Negative binomial regressions adjusted for gender, age, co-occurring diabetes, co-occurring chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and residence neighborhood were used to analyze units of service, and two-part (hurdle) multivariable models were used for expenditures. The main finding was a tendency for lower total number of hospital days for patients assigned to telemonitoring. Results for other covered services were generally consistent with hypothesized direction and magnitude; however, statistical power was reduced because of lowerthan- expected recruitment rates into the study. Within a managed-care environment, telemonitoring appears to facilitate better ambulatory management of heart failure patients, including fewer ED visits, which were offset by more frequent primary care and urgent care visits.},

Pain intensity and disability were evaluated by questionnaires at baseline, immediately after four weeks of treatment and at follow-up 3 months later. To investigate efficiency, the time-investment of both therapists and patients were assessed. Seventy-one subjects were included in the study (36 in the intervention group and 35 in the conventional care group). Myofeedback-based teletreatment was at least as effective clinically as conventional care. Pain intensity and disability decreased after 4 weeks of treatment in both groups and part of the effect remained at 3 months' follow-up. The teletreatment also increased efficiency for therapists by almost 20\% and patients experienced the benefits of less travel time and travel costs by remote consultation.

To evaluate the effects of an automated interactive voice response system (IVR) and Specialist Nurse Support to reduce health care utilization and improve health-related quality of life in children with asthma. Study Design. A randomized controlled trial in 121 children with doctor-diagnosed asthma and an acute presentation with asthma in the previous 12 months aged between 3 and 16 years. Children were randomized to one of three groups for a 6-month intervention receiving asthma education and management support from a Specialist Nurse by telephone or e-mail (N=41), from IVR (N=39), or receiving usual care (control group; N=41). Outcomes included health care utilization and use of oral steroid rescue. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) data using the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory were collected at baseline and at the end of the study. Results: There was no statistically significant benefit identified for either the IVR or the Nurse Support interventions for health care utilization, use of oral steroid rescue, or HRQOL compared with controls. Relative to controls, the incremental costs were-A\$225.73 (95\% confidence interval CI:-A\$840, A\$391) per child for the Nurse Support intervention and-A\$451.45 (-A\$1075, A\$173) per child for IVR. The results were most sensitive to the frequency of admissions to hospital. Conclusion. This study suggested that both IVR and Nurse Support interventions may be cost-saving from a health system perspective, with IVR providing the greatest benefit and this pilot study provides a strong basis for developing larger trials with longer follow-up. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

All costs included in the total costs measure contributed to this difference. Inpatient, outpatient, and nursing home costs were all assessed separately, but only nursing home costs reached significance (p = .009), with a savings of \$1,057 per patient at 6 months.

However, it requires a process of adaptation not always achieved due to poor compliance. The role of telemonitoring of NIV is not yet established. Objectives: To test the advantage of using modem communication in NIV of ALS patients. Design: Prospective, single blinded controlled trial. Population and methods: According to their residence, 40 consecutive ventilated ALS patients were assigned to one of two groups: a control group (G1, n=20) in which compliance and ventilator parameter settings were assessed during office visits; or an intervention group (G2, n=20) in which patients received a modem device connected to the ventilator. The number of office and emergency room visits and hospital admissions during the entire span of NIV use and the number of parameter setting changes to achieve full compliance were the primary outcome measurements. Results: Demographic and clinical features were similar between the two groups at admission. No difference in compliance was found between the groups. The incidence of changes in parameter settings throughout the survival period with NIV was lower in G2 (p{\textless}0.0001) but it was increased during the initial period needed to achieve full compliance. The number of office or emergency room visits and inhospital admissions was significantly lower in G2 (p{\textless}0.0001). Survival showed a trend favouring G2 (p=0.13).

	abstract = {Obesity is one of the most important medical and public health problems of our time: it increases the risk of many health complications such as hypertension, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes, needs long-lasting treatment for effective results and involves high public and private costs. Therefore, it is imperative that enduring and low-cost clinical programs for obesity and related co-morbidities are developed and evaluated. TECNOB (TEChnology for OBesity) is a comprehensive two-phase stepped down program enhanced by telemedicine for the long-term treatment of obese people with type 2 diabetes seeking intervention for weight loss. Its core features are the hospital-based intensive treatment (1-month), that consists of diet therapy, physical training and psychological counseling, and the continuity of care at home using new information and communication technologies (ICT) such as internet and mobile phones. The effectiveness of the TECNOB program compared with usual care (hospital-based treatment only) will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome is weight in kilograms. Secondary outcome measures are energy expenditure measured using an electronic armband, glycated hemoglobin, binge eating, self-efficacy in eating and weight control, body satisfaction, healthy habit formation, disordered eating-related behaviors and cognitions, psychopathological symptoms and weight-related quality of life. Furthermore, the study will explore what behavioral and psychological variables are predictive of treatment success among those we have considered. The TECNOB study aims to inform the evidence-based knowledge of how telemedicine may enhance the effectiveness of clinical interventions for weight loss and related type-2 diabetes, and which type of obese patients may benefit the most from such interventions. Broadly, the study aims also to have a effect on the theoretical model behind the traditional health care service, in favor of a change towards a new "health care everywhere" approach.},

The time required for local or remote programming was measured and resulting MAP T and C levels were compared. The recipient provided feedback on the local and remote programming session. The audiologist and monitoring clinician were asked for their feedback on remote programming. Results: Remote programming sessions were successfully finished for 69 recipients. No significant differences between T and C levels obtained by local and remote programming were found. The audiologists and monitoring clinicians agreed that the remote programming system provided an acceptable level of performance after most sessions. More than 50 participating recipients considered remote programming an efficient alternative to face-to-face- programming. © 2010 Informa Healthcare.},

	abstract = {Background-Secondary prevention by risk factor modification improves patient outcomes, yet it is often not achieved in clinical practice. Reasons for failure stem from challenges of prioritizing risk factor reduction and engaging patients in changing their behaviors. We hypothesize that a novel telemedicine intervention with tailored patient education could improve cardiovascular risk factors. Methods-To evaluate this intervention, we propose enrolling 450 patients with a recent myocardial infarction and hypertension into a 3-arm randomized, controlled trial. The first arm (n=150) will receive home blood pressure (BP) monitors plus a nurse-delivered, telephone-based tailored patient education intervention and will be enrolled into HealthVault, a Microsoft electronic health record platform. The second arm (n=150) will also receive BP monitors plus a tailored patient education intervention and be enrolled in HeartVault. However, the patient education intervention will be delivered by a Web-based program and will cover topics identical to those in the nurse-delivered intervention. Both arms will be compared with a control group receiving standard care (n=150). All participants will have an in-person assessment at baseline and at completion of the study, including standardized measurements of BP, LDL cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin (in diabetic subjects). The study design will allow assessment of a telephone-based, nurse-administered disease management program versus standard care. The main outcome of interest is the reduction in systolic BP in each intervention group compared with the control group at 12 months. Secondary outcomes assessed will include reductions in LDL cholesterol, body weight, and glycosylated hemoglobin, as well as adherence to evidence-based therapies and improvement in health behaviors. Conclusion-If successful in optimizing BP control, managing other coronary heart disease risk factors, and demonstrating a lower cost, the Web-based disease management tool has the potential to enhance coronary artery disease management, quality of care, and ultimately, patient outcomes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - In a six-month open-label parallel-group, multicenter study, adult patients (n = 180) with type 1 diabetes ({\textgreater}1 year), on a basal-bolus insulin regimen ({\textgreater}6 months), with HbA1c ≥8\%, were randomized to usual quarterly follow-up (G1), home use of a smartphone recommending insulin doses with quarterly visits (G2), or use of the smartphone with short teleconsultations every 2 weeks but no visit until point end (G3). RESULTS - Six-month mean HbA1c in G3 (8.41 ± 1.04\%) was lower than in G1 (9.10 ± 1.16\%; P = 0.0019). G2 displayed intermediate results (8.63 ± 1.07\%). The Diabeo system gave a 0.91\% (0.60; 1.21) improvement in HbA1c over controls and a 0.67\% (0.35; 0.99) reduction when used without teleconsultation. There was no difference in the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes or in medical time spent for hospital or telephone consultations. However, patients in G1 and G2 spent nearly 5 h more than G3 patients attending hospital visits. CONCLUSIONS - The Diabeo system gives a substantial improvement to metabolic control in chronic, poorly controlled type 1 diabetic patients without requiring more medical time and at a lower overall cost for the patient than usual care. © 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.},

	abstract = {Background: Postnatal depression (PND) can be experienced by 13\% of women who give birth, and such women often exhibit disabling symptoms, which can have a negative effect on the mother and infant relationship, with significant consequences in terms of the child's later capacity for affect regulation. Research has shown that providing support to mothers experiencing PND can help reduce their depressive symptoms and improve their coping strategies. The Mums4Mums study aims to evaluate the impact of telephone peer-support for women experiencing PND.Methods/Design: The study design adopts the MRC framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions. Health visitors in Warwickshire and Coventry Primary Care Trusts are screening potential participants at the 8-week postnatal check using either the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS {\textgreater} = 10) or the three Whooley questions recommended by NICE (http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG45). The Mums4Mums telephone support intervention is being delivered by trained peer-supporters over a period of four months. The primary outcome is depressive symptomatology as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes include mother-child interaction, dyadic adjustment, parenting sense of competence scale, and self-efficacy. Maternal perceptions of the telephone peer-support are being assessed using semi-structured interviews following the completion of the intervention.Discussion: The proposed study will develop current innovative work in peer-led support interventions and telecare by applying existing expertise to a new domain (i.e. PND), testing the feasibility of a peer-led telephone intervention for mothers living with PND, and developing the relationship between the lay and clinical communities. The intervention will potentially benefit a significant number of patients and support a future application for a larger study to undertake a full evaluation of the clinical and cost effectiveness of telephone based peer-support for PND.Trial registration: ISRCTN: ISRCTN91450073.

In a randomized controlled trial, 105 hypertensive patients performed HBPM and 118 patients received usual care with conventional office BP monitoring during 6 months. Costs were quantified from the healthcare perspective. Non-parametric simulations were performed to quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were made. Major findings. Systolic and diastolic daytime and night-time ambulatory BP (ABP) were reduced in both groups. The uncertainty around the incremental cost effectiveness ratio point estimates was considerable for both systolic and diastolic ABP. For systolic ABP, the difference in cost effectiveness ratio between the two groups was 256 Danish kroner (DKK)/mmHg [95\% uncertainty interval, UI -860 to 4544]. For diastolic ABP, the difference in cost effectiveness ratio between the two groups was 655 DKK/mmHg [95\% UI -674 to 69315]. Medication and consultation costs were lowest in the intervention group, but were offset by the cost of the telemonitoring equipment. Conclusions. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that telemonitoring of home BP was more costly compared with usual monitoring of office BP.

	abstract = {AimsTo assess the cost-effectiveness and the cost utility of remote patient monitoring (RPM) when compared with the usual care approach based upon differences in the number of hospitalizations, estimated from a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs).Methods and resultsWe reviewed the literature published between January 2000 and September 2009 on multidisciplinary heart failure (HF) management, either by usual care or RPM to retrieve the number of hospitalizations and length of stay (LOS) for HF and for any cause. We performed a meta-analysis of 21 RCTs (5715 patients). Remote patient monitoring was associated with a significantly lower number of hospitalizations for HF [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.77, 95 CI 0.650.91, P {\textless} 0.001] and for any cause (IRR: 0.87, 95 CI: 0.790.96, P 0.003), while LOS was not different. Direct costs for hospitalization for HF were approximated by diagnosis-related group (DRG) tariffs in Europe and North America and were used to populate an economic model. The difference in costs between RPM and usual care ranged from €300 to €1000, favouring RPM. These cost savings combined with a quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gain of 0.06 suggest that RPM is a 'dominant' technology over existing standard care. In a budget impact analysis, the adoption of an RPM strategy entailed a progressive and linear increase in costs saved.ConclusionsThe novel cost-effectiveness data coupled with the demonstrated clinical efficacy of RPM should encourage its acceptance amongst clinicians and its consideration by third-party payers. At the same time, the scientific community should acknowledge the lack of prospectively and uniformly collected economic data and should request that future studies incorporate economic analyses. © 2010 The Author.},

	abstract = {Background: Remote patient monitoring of heart failure patients has been shown to improve health outcomes. However, the efficacy of a mobile phone-based remote monitoring system is unknown. The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to determine the effects of mobile phonebased remote monitoring on heart failure management. Methods: The remote monitoring (RM) group (N=50) took daily weight and blood pressure readings, weekly single-lead ECGs, and answered daily symptom questions on a mobile phone for 6 months. Readings were automatically transmitted wirelessly to the mobile phone and then to data servers. Alerts were sent to the patients and clinicians as required. The control (SC) group (N=50) was provided with standard of care. Paired Student t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (for normally and not normally distributed data, respectively) were performed on baseline and post-study blood tests and survey responses. Results: Approximately 70\% of RM patients completed at least 80\% of their daily readings over the 6 months. The Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) blood tests improved significantly only for the RM group (decrease of 178 pg/mL, p=.001) once the effect of the clinic was reduced by removing the patients who were enrolled into the clinic for less than 6 months (35 out of 100 participants). Quality of life measured with the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire also improved only for the RM group (decrease of 14 points, p=.02) using all patient data. Self-care maintenance (p=.05) and management (p=.03) measured with the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index had an improvement for only the RM group after removing new patients in the analysis. No differences were found between the RM and SC groups in terms of hospitalization or emergency department visits. Conclusion: Mobile phone-based remote monitoring systems are a scalable and cost-effective form of remote patient monitoring. In this study, we showed that a mobile phone-based remote monitoring system improved heart function, quality of life, and self-care. To achieve these positive outcomes, reductions in healthcare resource utilization might not immediately occur, but savings could be realized in the long-term.},

	abstract = {Background: Overweight and obesity are linked with Binge Eating Disorder (BED). Effective interventions to significantly reduce weight, maintain weight loss and manage associated pathologies like BED are tipically combined treatment options (dietetic, nutritional, physical, behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, pharmacological, surgical). Significant difficulties with regard to availability, costs, treatment adherence and long-term efficacy are present. Particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the therapeutic approach indicated both in in-patient and in out-patient settings for BED. In recent years systemic and systemic-strategic psychotherapies have been implemented to treat patients with obesity and BED involved in familiar problems. Particularly a brief protocol for the systemic-strategic treatment of BED, using overall the strategic dialogue, has been recently developed. Moreover telemedicine, a new promising low cost method, has been used for obesity with BED in out-patient settings in order to avoid relapse after the in-patient step of treatment and to keep on a continuity of care with the involvement of the same clinical in-patient team.Methods: The comparison between CBT and Brief Strategic Therapy (BST) will be assessed in a two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial. Due to the novelty of the application of BST in BED treatment (no other RCTs including BST have been carried out), a pilot study will be carried out before conducting a large scale randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Both CBT and BST group will follow an in-hospital treatment (diet, physical activity, dietitian counseling, 8 psychological sessions) plus 8 out-patient telephone-based sessions of psychological support and monitoring with the same in-patient psychotherapists. Primary outcome measure of the randomized trial will be the change in the Global Index of the Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45.2). Secondary outcome measures will be the percentage of BED patients remitted considering the number of weekly binge episodes and the weight loss. Data will be collected at baseline, at discharge from the hospital (c.a. 1 month after) and after 6-12-24 months from the end of the in-hospital treatment. Data at follow-up time points will be collected through tele-sessions.Discussion: The STRATOB (Systemic and STRATegic psychotherapy for OBesity), a comprehensive two-phase stepped down program enhanced by telepsychology for the medium-term treatment of obese people with BED seeking intervention for weight loss, will shed light about the comparison of the effectiveness of the BST with the gold standard CBT and about the continuity of care at home using a low-level of telecare (mobile phones).Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01096251. © 2011 Castelnuovo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to estimate the costs and cost-effectiveness of a telemedicine intensive care unit (ICU) (tele-ICU) program. Materials and Methods: We used an observational study with ICU patients cared for during the pre-tele-ICU period and ICU patients cared for during the post-tele-ICU period in 6 ICUs at 5 hospitals that are part of a large nonprofit health care system in the Gulf Coast region. We obtained data on a sample of 4142 ICU patients: 2034 in the pre-tele-ICU period and 2108 in the post-tele-ICU period. Economic outcomes were hospital costs, ICU costs and floor costs, measured for average daily costs, costs per case, and costs per patient. Results: After the implementation of the tele-ICU, the hospital daily cost increased from \$4302 to \$5340 (24\%); the hospital cost per case, from \$21 967 to \$31 318 (43\%); and the cost per patient, from \$20 231 to \$25 846 (28\%). Although the tele-ICU intervention was not cost-effective in patients with Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 50 or less, it was cost-effective in the sickest patients with Simplified Acute Physiology Score II more than 50 (17\% of patients) because it decreased hospital mortality without increasing costs significantly. Conclusions: Hospital administrators may conclude that a tele-ICU program aimed at the sickest patients is cost-effective. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

At present, UPDRS is determined by the subjective clinical evaluation of the patient's ability to adequately cope with a range of tasks. In this study, we extend recent findings that UPDRS can be objectively assessed to clinically useful accuracy using simple, self-administered speech tests, without requiring the patient's physical presence in the clinic. We apply a wide range of known speech signal processing algorithms to a large database (approx. 6000 recordings from 42 PD patients, recruited to a six-month, multi-centre trial) and propose a number of novel, nonlinear signal processing algorithms which reveal pathological characteristics in PD more accurately than existing approaches. Robust feature selection algorithms select the optimal subset of these algorithms, which is fed into non-parametric regression and classification algorithms, mapping the signal processing algorithm outputs to UPDRS. We demonstrate rapid, accurate replication of the UPDRS assessment with clinically useful accuracy (about 2 UPDRS points difference from the clinicians' estimates, p {\textless} 0.001). This study supports the viability of frequent, remote, cost-effective, objective, accurate UPDRS telemonitoring based on self-administered speech tests.

	abstract = {Telemonitoring technology offers one of the most promising alternatives for the provision of health care services at the patient's home. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a primary care-based telemonitoring intervention on the frequency of hospital admissions. A primary care-based randomised controlled trial will be carried out to assess the impact of a telemonitoring intervention aimed at home care patients with heart failure (HF) and/or chronic lung disease (CLD). The results will be compared with those obtained with standard health care practice. The duration of the study will be of one year. Sixty patients will be recruited for the study. In-home patients, diagnosed with HF and/or CLD, aged 14 or above and with two or more hospital admissions in the previous year will be eligible. For the intervention group, telemonitoring will consist of daily patient self-measurements of respiratory-rate, heart-rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, weight and body temperature. Additionally, the patients will complete a qualitative symptom questionnaire daily using the telemonitoring system. Routine telephone contacts will be conducted every fortnight and additional telephone contacts will be carried out if the data received at the primary care centre are out of the established limits. The control group will receive usual care. The primary outcome measure is the number of hospital admissions due to any cause that occurred in a period of 12 months post-randomisation. The secondary outcome measures are: duration of hospital stay, hospital admissions due to HF or CLD, mortality rate, use of health care resources, quality of life, cost-effectiveness, compliance and patient and health care professional satisfaction with the new technology. The results of this study will shed some light on the effects of telemonitoring for the follow-up and management of chronic patients from a primary care setting. The study may contribute to enhance the understanding of alternative modes of health care provision for medically unstable elderly patients, who bear a high degree of physical and functional deterioration.},

A randomized, controlled, clinical trial evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a 12-month remote DSME program that increased the availability of a CDE, a dietitian, and provided remotecamera retinal screening to patients with diabetes in rural community in South Carolina. Adults with type 2 diabetes were randomized (n=165; 85 intervention and 80 usual care). The intervention was conducted in-person and remotely in single and group formats. Usual care consisted of one education session by a CDE lasting about 15 minutes followed by approximately 4 hours of education by a health educator. Data were collected prospectively on clinical outcomes, health utilities, resource utilization, and costs. (Table presented) Cost-effectiveness may be understood in terms of its incremental cost relative to the incremental improvement in A1c, LDL-cholesterol, and eye exam rates. The incremental cost of the DTC intervention relative to usual care was \$1,380 over one year. The investment of \$1,380 over one year bought a 0.6\% absolute improvement in A1c and a 11 mg/dL absolute decrease in LDL-cholesterol. The incremental cost of the DTC educational intervention relative to usual care was less than the annual cost of adding a third-line pharmacologic agent to improve glycemia. The cost-utility for the combined DTC educational intervention and screening eye exam compared to no intervention would then be approximately \$17,000 per QALY-gained over 1 year. Interventions costing less than \$50,000 per QALY-gained are generally considered being cost-effective. This investment thus represents a good value for the money spent.},

Methods: We conducted a randomised controlled trial comparing Enhanced Standard Care (ESC) delivered by a nurse led clinic versus remote monitoring of physiological parameters (RM). Inclusion criteria were one hospitalisation for HF in the preceding six months or three prior HF admissions. Following training in HF home management, patients were randomised to an ESC group managed by a nurse led heart failure clinic or to an RM Group who were issued with a device recording physiological parameters with trends checked daily by a medical officer. Evaluations in both groups included monthly health checks, NYHA status, current medications and compliance, and quality of life data. The primary outcome was the number of emergency department attendances at six months. Secondary outcomes included hospital admissions, GP visits and specialist visits. Tertiary outcomes included quality of life and cost utility.(Table Presented) Results: Therewere no significant differences in the primary outcome measure of ED presentations during six months. Conclusion: in heart failure patients with recent or frequent hospitalisation for heart failure, remote physiological monitoring failed to show any benefit on ED presentations when compared with a nurse led clinic delivering enhanced standard care.},

These programs have typically been provided in clinical facilities, health clubs, and senior centers, which may be inconvenient and/or cost prohibitive for some older adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an automated telemedicine intervention that provides real-time guidance and monitoring of resistance training in the home. A randomized clinical trial in 103 middle-aged or older participants. Participants were assigned to use of a theory-driven interactive voice response system designed to promote resistance training (Telephone-Linked Computer-based Long-term Interactive Fitness Trainer; n = 52) or to an attention control (n = 51) for a period of 12 months. Measurements of muscle strength, balance, walk distance, and mood were obtained at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. We observed increased strength, improved balance, and fewer depressive symptoms in the intervention group than in the control group. Using generalized estimating equations modeling, group differences were statistically significant for knee flexion strength (p = .035), single-leg stance time (p = .029), and Beck Depression Inventory (p = .030). This computer-based telecommunications exercise intervention led to improvements in participants' strength, balance, and depressive symptoms. Because of their low cost and easy accessibility, computer-based interventions may be a cost-effective way of promoting exercise in the home.},

	abstract = {Background: Obesity increases the risk of many health complications such as hypertension, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes, needs long-lasting treatment for effective results and involves high public and private care-costs. Therefore, it is imperative that enduring and low-cost clinical programs for obesity and related co-morbidities are developed and evaluated. Information and communication technologies (ICT) can help clinicians to deliver treatment in a cost-effective and time-saving manner to a large number of obese individuals with co-morbidities. Objective: To examine ad interim effectiveness of a 12-month multidisciplinary telecare intervention for weight loss provided to obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A single-center randomized controlled trial (TECNOB study) started in December 2008. At present, 72 obese patients with type 2 diabetes have been recruited and randomly allocated to the TECNOB program (n=37) or to a control condition (n=39). However, only 34 participants have completed at least the 3-month follow-up and have been included in this ad interim analysis. 21 out of them have reached also the 6-month follow-up and 13 have achieved the end of the program. Study is still on-going. Intervention: All participants attended 1-month inpatient intensive program that involved individualized medical care, diet therapy, physical training and brief psychological counseling. At discharge, participants allocated to the TECNOB program were instructed to use a weight-loss web-site, a web-based videoconference tool, a dietary software installed into their cellular phones and an electronic armband measuring daily steps and energy expenditure. Main Outcome Measures: Weight and disordered eating-related behaviors and cognitions (EDI-2) at entry to hospital, at discharge from hospital, at 3,6 and 12 months. Results: Ad interim analysis of data from 34 participants showed no statistically significant difference between groups in weight change at any time-point. However, within-group analysis revealed significant reductions of initial weight at discharge from hospital, at 3 months, at 6 months but not at 12 months. Control group had higher scores in Interpersonal distrust at 12 months. Conclusion: This ad interim findings revealed that the effect of the inpatient treatment was high and probably overwhelmed the effect of the TECNOB intervention. Much statistical power and long-term follow-up may enhance the probability to detect the TECNOB effect over and above the great one exerted by the inpatient program. © Castelnuovo et al.},

Randomized controlled trial to compare a telehomecare intervention for patients 55 and older following hospital discharge for HF to usual skilled home care. Primary endpoints were 30- and 60-day all-cause and HF readmission, hospital days, and time to readmission or death. Secondary outcomes were access to care, emergency department (ED) use, and satisfaction with care. All-cause readmissions at 30 days (16 versus 19) and over six months (46 versus 52) were lower in the telehomecare group but were not statistically significant. Access to care and satisfaction were significantly higher for the telehomecare patients, including the number of in-person visits and days in home care. Conclusions.

A quasi-randomized study design was used, with a panel of 20 emergency medicine doctors who independently reviewed previously-stored consultations using the two modalities. In total, 60 case reviews were conducted during five sessions, representing 33 different cases from the routine workload of Minor Treatment Centres in Scotland. More experienced doctors transferred fewer patients than less experienced doctors. The proportion of patients transferred was higher when PACS was used than when video was used in most of the cases. A mixed effects logistic regression model was fitted to the data. The estimated odds for patient transfer were 56\% lower when video was used instead of PACS (odds ratio 0.44, 95\% confidence interval 0.20, 0.93). Although the cost implications are not yet known, video support for local decision-making should remain the preferred method of telemedicine for minor injuries work.},

We examined the effect of RPM on hospital utilization and Medicare costs of HF patients receiving home care. Two studies were simultaneously conducted: A randomized and a matched-cohort study. In the randomized study, 168 subjects were randomly assigned (after hospitalization) to home care utilizing RPM (live nursing visits and video-based nursing visits) or to home care receiving live nursing visits only. In the matched-cohort study, 160 subjects receiving home care with RPM (live nursing visits and video-based nursing visits) were matched with home care subjects receiving live nursing visits only. Regardless of whether outcomes were being analyzed for all subjects (intention to treat) or for hospitalized subjects only, hospitalization rates, time to first admission, length of stay, and costs to Medicare did not differ significantly between groups in either study at 30 or 90 days after enrollment. A notable trend, however, emerged across studies: Although time to hospitalization was shorter in the RPM groups than the control groups, RPM groups had lower hospitalization costs. RPM, when utilized in conjunction with a robust management protocol, was not found to significantly differ from live nursing visits in the management of HF in home care. Shorter hospitalization times and lower associated costs may be due to earlier identification of exacerbation. These trends indicate the need for further study.},

Other factors including anxiety (HADS score≥11, 75-56\%, P{\textless}0.01), depression (HADS score≥11, 73-51 \%, P{\textless} 0.01), QoL (QLQ-C30 score, 2.77-2.62, P{\textless}0.01), and Karnofsky score (32-66, P{\textless}0.01) were also improved in 1 week. However, the level of distress (DT scale ≥4, 92-87 \%, P=0.27) was not recovered. Telemonitoring plus standardized education group showed a more significant pain improvement (portion of average pain≥5, 35 vs. 19 \%, P=0.02). Conclusions: Standardized pain education using a nursing specialist is an efficient way to improve not only pain itself but also anxiety, depression, performance, and QoL. The addition of telemonitoring helps improve pain management, and telemonitoring is a simple and cost-effective intervention in outpatients.},

	abstract = {Introduction: A mobile phone-based system (ASyMS-H) was developed to remotely monitor key chemotherapy toxicities in 'real time' (e.g. fever/infection, bleeding, nausea/vomiting, mucositis, diarrhoea) alongside algorithms to alert treating clinicians (via SMS) of significant toxicities and to provide tailored evidence-based self-care information to patients. Objective: The objective was to pilot ASyMS-H with patients/nurses and obtain feedback for system refinement. Methods: A convenience sample of haematological cancer patients used ASyMS-H twice daily for one cycle of chemotherapy. Nurses monitoring automated alerts, as well as patients, completed semistructured interviews which were audio-recorded, transcribed and underwent qualitative analyses. Basic system usage frequencies were collected. Results: Seventeen patients (mean age, 49 years) with non-Hodgkin (ten), Hodgkin's lymphoma (five) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (two) used ASyMS-H for a total of 365 days and competed interviews. Thirty-two alerts (red, 11; amber, 21) were generated most commonly for nausea (nine) and mucositis (eight). Nine cancer nurses used ASyMS-H and completed interviews. The use of ASyMS-H was supported by patients/nurses with common themes, including: good fit with patient/nurse routine; ease of use; source of patient reassurance/ empowerment; enabling early intervention, promoting communication and potential use for predictive symptom modeling. Patient guilt over generating alerts was noted; however, nurses felt alerts were appropriate for clinical intervention. Suggested changes to the system included additional symptoms and disease-specific information and improved symptom descriptors. Conclusions: ASyMS-H was highly valued and the feedback used to build an amended version of the system. ASyMS-H is currently incorporated into a unique nurse-led supportive care/educational intervention, with improvements in patient outcomes/cost effectiveness investigated in a randomized controlled trial.},

	abstract = {Elderly patients are at high risk of malnutrition and sarcopenia, promoting further morbidity which in turn decreases quality of life and increases the claiming of medical services and associated costs. Early and sustained administration of oral nutritional supplements has been shown to improve the nutritional status with robust clinical benefit. Many patients however, poorly adhere to prescribed supplements, so consistent monitoring is needed. Clinical monitoring usually ends with the discharge rendering the continuation of nutritional supplement therapy in the patient's home problematic. We developed a telemedicine based health care concept for intensive home monitoring. In a first randomized controlled prospective study we analyzed the feasibility of this innovative approach. The intervention group received oral nutritional supplements and telemedical monitoring with daily assessment of body weight, number of taken oral energy supplements and state of health. The control group received usual care. 13 patients were included in each group, eight patients of the intervention group left the study prematurely, five patients were closely monitored and used the devices for a mean 67 ± 63.5 days. Follow up data of body weight and BMI showed no relevant differences between both groups. The results and experiences gained in this pilot study demonstrate that telemedical systems provide encouraging new options to enable an intensive monitoring of malnourished patients. A continuous intensive therapy monitoring of this patient group however, is a particular challenge. Albeit possibilities, limitations and useful parameters were identified, which will be used to improve the conception in an ongoing prospective randomized trial. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Half of patients with hypertension have poor blood pressure (BP) control. Recent models for treating hypertension have integrated disease monitoring and telephone-based interventions delivered in patients' homes. This study evaluated the costs of the Hypertension Intervention Nurse Telemedicine Study (HINTS), aimed to improve BP control in veterans. Methods: Eligible veterans were randomized to either usual care or 1 of 3 telephone-based intervention groups using home BP telemonitoring: (1) behavioral management, (2) medication management, or (3) combined. Intervention costs were derived from information collected during the trial. Direct medical costs (inpatient, outpatient, and outpatient pharmacy, including hypertension-specific pharmacy) at 18 months by group were calculated using Veterans Affairs (VA) Decision Support System data. Bootstrapped CIs were computed to compare intervention and medical costs between intervention groups and usual care. Results: Patients receiving behavior or medication management showed significant gains in BP control at 12 months; there were no differences in BP control at 18 months. In subgroup analysis, patients with poor baseline BP control receiving combined intervention significantly improved BP at 12 and 18 months. In overall and subgroup samples, average intervention costs were similar in the 3 study arms, and at 18 months, there were no statistically significant differences in direct VA medical costs or total VA costs between treatment arms and usual care. Conclusions: To optimize investment in telephone-based home interventions such as the HINTS, it is important to identify groups of patients who are most likely to benefit from more intensive home BP management. © 2012 Mosby, Inc.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To assess the sustainability, clinical utility and acceptability to clinicians and parents of a tele-homecare programme for infants with major congenital heart disease (CHD), and to evaluate the impact on healthcare resource use. Design: Randomised control trial. Setting: UK tertiary congenital cardiac centre. Participants: 83 infants with major CHD. Intervention: Participants were randomised to one of three groups: video-conferencing support (n=35), telephone support (n=24) and a control group (n=24). Patients in the two intervention groups received regular, standardised remote consultations. Video-conferences (VCs) were facilitated by Integrated Systems Digital Network lines and replaced by home broadband connections later in the study. Main outcome measures: Healthcare resource use, utilisation including hospitalisation, clinicians' opinions on utility and quality of interventions, parental opinions on quality of interventions. Results: Clinicians were more confident making medical decisions following VCs compared with telephone consultations (p=0.01). Both VC and telephone support were very well received, but parents expressed significantly higher levels of satisfaction with VC support (p=0.001). Healthcare resource use was 37\% lower in the video-conferencing group compared with both telephone support and control groups (p{\textless}0.001), as was the risk of hospitalisation (p=0.006). Direct health service costs were significantly lower in the video-conferencing group (p{\textless}0.05). Conclusions: A tele-medicine home support programme for families of infants with major CHD is feasible, sustainable and effective. Home support with video-conferencing is superior to telephone consultations. Parents are highly satisfied with tele-homecare. Telehomecare significantly reduces health service utilisation and may reduce health service costs.},

	abstract = {Background: Patients with haematological malignancies are at increased risk of serious/life-threatening chemotherapy toxicities. We have previously developed a highly acceptable system to remotely monitor/manage chemotherapy toxicities of haematological cancer patients in the community setting. This phase II trial combines the remote monitoring system with a novel nurse-led intervention (PRISMS). Aims: To pilot the intervention to: estimate potential effect sizes/coefficients of variation to form the basis of power calculations; calculate patient recruitment/retention rates; assess intervention compliance rates. Methods/design: Thirty patients are being recruited from two Melbourne hospitals. Eligibility criteria include: diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic leukaemia/ Hodgkin's/Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; aged 18 years. Patients are randomized 1:1 to either the control or intervention arm. Patients allocated to the control arm receive 'Usual Care' whilst those allocated to the intervention will receive the PRISMS intervention in addition to 'Usual Care'. Randomization is stratified by site/diagnosis/Chemotherapy toxicity. Intervention patients will be provided with a computer tablet and software prompting twice-daily completion of physical/emotional indicators (eg temperature/ depression/distress) and side-effects (eg vomiting) for four treatment cycles. Should patient data exceed pre-determined limits an email alert is delivered to the treatment team with nurses logging-in to view historical data/provide clinical intervention. In addition 6 scheduled nursing interventions support patients in device usage/self care. Trial outcomes assess: symptom severity, psychological distress/anxiety/depression, quality-of-life (pen-and-paper questionnaires); health service useage/costs (medical record audit/interview); intervention compliance (system logs). Discussion: This trial is the first in the world to both develop a remote monitoring system for haematological cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and to combine the system with a nurse-led intervention. Findings from this trial are essential so that a future phase III trial is not undermined by poor compliance, recruitment/retention rates and smaller than expected effect sizes. The future use of such monitoring systems have the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce health care costs.},

The concept of the TELEKAT project is to reduce admissions by enabling the COPD patients to conduct self-monitoring and maintain rehabilitation activities in their own home. COPD patients with severe and very severe COPD were included in the study. This economic evaluation follows international guidelines for the conduction of a CUA alongside a clinical randomized controlled trial. The analysis is based on a health sector perspective. The mean incremental cost efficiency ratio, located in the southeast quadrant, shows that telerehabilitation is less costly and more effective than the rehabilitation given to the control group. The telerehabilitation program produces more value for money and generates savings on healthcare budgets. The telerehabilitation program appears to be more cost-effective than the conventional rehabilitation program for COPD patients. Further studies of cost-effectiveness with a focus on large-scale studies are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Telemedicine innovations, including short message service (SMS), have been used to address a range of health concerns in a variety of settings. Practical, safe, and cost-effective, this simple tool can also potentially improve patients' understanding toward their own diseases via knowledge enhancement. This study was designed to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of an SMS-based epilepsy educational program for epilepsy patients.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective randomized interventional study. Epilepsy outpatients from three general hospitals in East Coast Peninsular Malaysia received the SMS-based mobile epilepsy educational system (MEES) for a 3-month period.
RESULTS: In total, 51 patients completed the study (median age, 25.0 years; 51.0\% female; 92.2\% Malay; 56.9\% single; education level, 70.6\% ≤SPM/Cambridge O-level equivalent; 25.5\% supportive workers; monthly income, 58.8\% ≤MYR 500.0/USD 158.5). Approximately 86.0\% of the patients owned at least a mobile phone. The total cost of SMS delivery was economically affordable (MYR 3.08/USD 0.98 per patient). Overall, 74.0\% agreed that MEES was either very or quite useful. It is encouraging that the majority of patients have offered positive comments and favorable opinions specifically toward epilepsy education (94.0\%), drug-taking reminder (90.0\%), and clinic appointment reminder (88.0\%). It was also reported that 88.2\% of the participants would recommend MEES to other people with epilepsy.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study adds to the growing evidence suggesting that a greater investment in telemedicine programs involving SMS would be both feasible and well received by patients and could be a potentially valuable approach to increase access and effectiveness of epilepsy care.},

Adults (N=167) with a diagnosis of depression were recruited from a community clinic and were randomly assigned to treatment condition. Webcam participants met remotely each month with the psychiatrist, and treatment-as-usual patients received customary care from their primary care providers, all for six months. At baseline and three and six months, analyses of variance tested differences between conditions in scores on depression rating scales and quality-of-life and functional ability measures. Results: All participants experienced an improvement in depression symptoms. Ratings on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale by clinicians blind to treatment group and self-ratings on the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, and Sheehan Disability Scale showed a significant main effect of time. On all four measures, a significant interaction of time by intervention favoring the Webcam group was noted.

Patients Forty-three patients treated with long-term warfarin therapy and monitored initially in the anticoagulation clinic setting and then with STORM2, referred from 11 medical practices. Intervention Patients were asked to complete a survey and the Duke Anticoagulation Satisfaction Scale (DASS) before (at baseline) and after at least 3 months of STORM2 (at follow-up). Measurements and Main Results Patient satisfaction and time were assessed by survey and the DASS. Costs were measured from the patient's perspective. Overall 90\% of responders preferred STORM 2 to traditional clinic management. The DASS questions indicated that patients were more satisfied with their anticoagulation treatment and more likely to recommend oral anticoagulation to a friend after experiencing STORM2. In addition, patients found STORM2 to be less complicated and more convenient than traditional clinic management. For each traditional monthly visit, patients drove 20 miles and expended a total of 1.8 hours; using 55¢/mile for mileage reimbursement and 15/hour for lost wages, the cost for each visit was 38. The total cost for four STORM2 visits per month was 10, for a net savings of 28 per patient per month. A total of 76\% of patients were willing to pay additional money to eliminate a monthly clinic visit. Conclusion STORM2 is more convenient, less complicated, preferred by patients, and saves patients time and money compared with clinic management. © 2013 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background/aims: Remote monitoring for heart failure has not only been evaluated in a large number of randomised controlled trials, but also in many systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The aim of this meta-review was to identify, appraise and synthesise existing systematic reviews that have evaluated the effects of remote monitoring in heart failure. Methods: Using a Cochrane methodology, we electronically searched all relevant online databases and search engines, performed a forward citation search as well as hand-searched bibliographies. Only fully published systematic reviews of invasive and/or non-invasive remote monitoring interventions were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Results: Sixty-five publications from 3333 citations were identified. Seventeen fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality varied with A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR scores) ranging from 2 to 11 (mean 5.88). Seven reviews (41\%) pooled results from individual studies for meta-analysis. Eight (47\%) considered all non-invasive remote monitoring strategies. Four (24\%) focused specifically on telemonitoring. Four (24\%) included studies investigating both non-invasive and invasive technologies. Population characteristics of the included studies were not reported consistently. Mortality and hospitalizations were the most frequently reported outcomes 12 (70\%). Only five reviews (29\%) reported healthcare costs and compliance. A high degree of heterogeneity was reported in many of the meta-analyses. Conclusions: These results should be considered in context of two negative RCTs of remote monitoring for heart failure that have been published since the meta-analyses (TIM-HF and Tele-HF). However, high quality reviews demonstrated improved mortality, quality of life, reduction in hospitalisations and healthcare costs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental health condition with substantial costs to individuals and society. Among military veterans, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD has been estimated to be as high as 20\%. Numerous research studies have demonstrated that short-term cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), lead to substantial and sustained improvements in PTSD symptoms. Despite known benefits, only a minority of clinicians provide these therapies. Transferring this research knowledge into clinical settings remains one of the largest hurdles to improving the health of veterans with PTSD. Attending a workshop alone is insufficient to promote adequate knowledge transfer and sustained skill; however, relatively little research has been conducted to identify effective post-training support strategies.
METHODS: The current study investigates whether clinicians receiving post-workshop support (six-month duration) will deliver CPT with greater fidelity (i.e., psychotherapy adherence and competence) and have improved patient outcomes compared with clinicians receiving no formal post-workshop support. The study conditions are: technology-enhanced group tele-consultation; standard group tele-consultation; and fidelity assessment with no consultation. The primary outcome is independent assessment (via audio-recordings) of the clinicians' adherence and competence in delivering CPT. The secondary outcome is observed changes in patient symptoms during and following treatment as a function of clinician fidelity. Post-consultation interviews with clinicians will help identify facilitators and barriers to psychotherapy skill acquisition. The study results will inform how best to implement and transfer evidence-based psychotherapy (e.g., CPT) to clinical settings to attain comparable outcomes to those observed in research settings.
DISCUSSION: Findings will deepen our understanding of how much and what type of support is needed following a workshop to help clinicians become proficient in delivering a new protocol. Several influences on clinician learning and patient outcomes will be discussed. An evidence-based model of clinical consultation will be developed, with the ultimate goal of informing policy and influencing best practice in clinical consultation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators place a significant burden on health care systems. Remote monitoring allows assessment of device function and heart failure parameters, and may represent a safe, effective, and cost-saving method compared to conventional in-office follow-up.
OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that remote device monitoring represents a cost-effective approach. This paper summarizes the economic evaluation of the Evolution of Management Strategies of Heart Failure Patients With Implantable Defibrillators (EVOLVO) study, a multicenter clinical trial aimed at measuring the benefits of remote monitoring for heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators.
METHODS: Two hundred patients implanted with a wireless transmission-enabled implantable defibrillator were randomized to receive either remote monitoring or the conventional method of in-person evaluations. Patients were followed for 16 months with a protocol of scheduled in-office and remote follow-ups. The economic evaluation of the intervention was conducted from the perspectives of the health care system and the patient. A cost-utility analysis was performed to measure whether the intervention was cost-effective in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.
RESULTS: Overall, remote monitoring did not show significant annual cost savings for the health care system (€1962.78 versus €2130.01; P=.80). There was a significant reduction of the annual cost for the patients in the remote arm in comparison to the standard arm (€291.36 versus €381.34; P=.01). Cost-utility analysis was performed for 180 patients for whom QALYs were available. The patients in the remote arm gained 0.065 QALYs more than those in the standard arm over 16 months, with a cost savings of €888.10 per patient. Results from the cost-utility analysis of the EVOLVO study show that remote monitoring is a cost-effective and dominant solution.
CONCLUSIONS: Remote management of heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators appears to be cost-effective compared to the conventional method of in-person evaluations.

	abstract = {We assessed a two-stage follow-up procedure for cardiac pacemakers, where in-clinic follow-ups were partly replaced by telemedical follow-ups. This was compared with the standard follow-up regime (in-clinic follow-up only). The new procedure required an electronic patient record, a telemedical follow-up unit for recording ECGs while the pacemaker was temporarily set to magnet mode, an ECG processing unit, and a reviewing and reporting unit. A total of 177 (86 female) patients were randomized to the control group and 182 (98 female) patients to the telemedicine group. In the telemedicine group, 234 telemedical follow-ups were performed. Out of these, 68 required an additional in-clinic follow-up, while 166 were sufficient for assessing the pacemakers' working status. During the study, there were 19 deaths in the telemedicine group and 20 in the control group. There was no significant difference between the two groups(P = 0.40). The probability that an individual patient's pacemaker would not to be replaced over time was analysed in a similar way to the Kaplan-Meier survival function. Fewer pacemakers were replaced in the telemedicine group (14) than in the control group (18), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.26). We conclude that alternating telemedical and in-clinic follow-ups brings no additional risks for patients. The follow-up procedure is feasible and interpretation of the pacemakers' magnet effect provides an easy-to-use, manufacturer-independent method of assessing the pacemakers' working status. This should reduce the patient load on pacemaker centres and decrease the overall costs of pacemaker therapy. © The Author(s) 2013.},

	abstract = {To determine if self-monitoring via home-based telehealth equipment could, when combined with ongoing remote monitoring by a nurse, reduce the incidence of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) presentations for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A randomized controlled trial was used to compare the outcomes for participants receiving the telehealth equipment and monitoring with those for participants in an information-only control group, over a period of 6 months. Participants receiving the telehealth intervention were taught to measure and record their vital signs (blood pressure, weight, temperature, pulse, and oxygen saturation levels) on a daily basis. These were then transmitted automatically via telephone to a secure Web site where they were monitored each day by the telehealth nurse. The telehealth group had fewer ED presentations and hospital admissions and a reduced length of stay in comparison with the control group. These results were not statistically significant. However, the reduction in health service use was large enough to result in significant cost savings, with the annual cost savings of the telehealth group compared with the control group being \$2,931 per person. Telehealth monitoring of patient vital signs reduced health service utilization for individuals with COPD and resulted in significant cost savings. In terms of individual health benefits, improvements in participants' self-management behaviors and control over their condition was evident.},

	abstract = {Although effective psychotherapies for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exist, high percentages of Veterans in need of services are unable to access them. One particular challenge to providing cost-effective psychological treatments to Veterans with PTSD involves the difficulty and high cost of delivering in-person, specialized psychotherapy to Veterans residing in geographically remote locations. The delivery of these services via clinical videoteleconferencing (CVT) has been presented as a potential solution to this access to care problem. This study is a retrospective cost analysis of a randomized controlled trial investigating telemedicine service delivery of an anger management therapy for Veterans with PTSD. The parent trial found that the CVT condition provided clinical results that were comparable to the in-person condition. Several cost outcomes were calculated in order to investigate the clinical and cost outcomes associated with the CVT delivery modality relative to in-person delivery. The CVT condition was significantly associated with lower total costs compared with the in-person delivery condition. The delivery of mental health services via CVT enables Veterans who would not normally receive these services access to empirically based treatments. Additional studies addressing long-term healthcare system costs, indirect cost factors at the patient and societal levels, and the use of CVT in other geographic regions of the United States are needed. The results of this study provide evidence that CVT is a cost-reducing mode of service delivery to Veterans with PTSD relative to in-person delivery.},

Home monitoring of blood pressure (BP) is an integral part of management, but requires that patients bring records to clinic visits. Telemonitoring interventions, however, have not targeted older, less technologically-skilled populations. METHODS: Veterans with stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease and uncontrolled hypertension were randomized to a novel telemonitoring device pairing a Bluetooth-enabled BP cuff with an Internet-enabled hub, which wirelessly transmitted readings (n=28), or usual care (n=15). Home recordings were reviewed weekly and telemonitoring participants were contacted if BP was above goal. The prespecified primary endpoints were improved data exchange and device acceptability. Secondary endpoint was BP change. RESULTS: Forty-three participants (average age 68 years, 75\% white) completed the 6-month study. Average start-of-study BP was 147/78 mmHg. Those in the intervention arm had a median of 29 (IQR 22, 53) transmitted BP readings per month, with 78\% continuing to use the device regularly, whereas only 20\% of those in the usual care group brought readings to in-person visits. The median number of telephone contacts triggered by the wireless monitoring was 2 (IQR 1, 4) per patient. Both groups had a significant improvement in systolic BP (P{\textless}0.05, for both changes); systolic BP fell a median of 13 mmHg in monitored participants compared with 8.5 mmHg in usual care participants (P for comparison 0.31). CONCLUSION: This low-cost wireless monitoring strategy led to greater sharing of data between patients and clinic and produced a trend toward improvements in BP control over usual care at 6 months. © Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the costs and cost effectiveness of telehealth in addition to standard support and treatment, compared with standard support and treatment. Design: Economic evaluation nested in a pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting: Community based telehealth intervention in three local authority areas in England. Participants: 3230 people with a long term condition (heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or diabetes) were recruited into the Whole Systems Demonstrator telehealth trial between May 2008 and December 2009. Of participants taking part in the Whole Systems Demonstrator telehealth questionnaire study examining acceptability, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness, 845 were randomised to telehealth and 728 to usual care. Interventions: Intervention participants received a package of telehealth equipment and monitoring services for 12 months, in addition to the standard health and social care services available in their area. Controls received usual health and social care. Main outcome measure: Primary outcome for the cost effectiveness analysis was incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results: We undertook net benefit analyses of costs and outcomes for 965 patients (534 receiving telehealth; 431 usual care). The adjusted mean difference in QALY gain between groups at 12 months was 0.012. Total health and social care costs (including direct costs of the intervention) for the three months before 12 month interview were £1390 (€1610; \$2150) and £1596 for the usual care and telehealth groups, respectively. Cost effectiveness acceptability curves were generated to examine decision uncertainty in the analysis surrounding the value of the cost effectiveness threshold. The incremental cost per QALY of telehealth when added to usual care was £92 000. With this amount, the probability of cost effectiveness was low (11\% at willingness to pay threshold of £30 000; {\textgreater}50\% only if the threshold exceeded about £90 000). In sensitivity analyses, telehealth costs remained slightly (non-significantly) higher than usual care costs, even after assuming that equipment prices fell by 80\% or telehealth services operated at maximum capacity. However, the most optimistic scenario (combining reduced equipment prices with maximum operating capacity) eliminated this group difference (cost effectiveness ratio £12 000 per QALY). Conclusions: The QALY gain by patients using telehealth in addition to usual care was similar to that by patients receiving usual care only, and total costs associated with the telehealth intervention were higher. Telehealth does not seem to be a cost effective addition to standard support and treatment.},

	abstract = {Background: While telemonitoring has not shown clear benefits, heart failure (HF) management programs had. It is unknown whether a management program based on telemedicine provides advantages compared to conventional management on a HF program. Objectives: Evaluate efficacy and costs benefits of a HF management program using telemedicine compared to standard HF management program. Methods: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing two management strategies of high risk HF patients: HFP (heart failure programme) or HFP + T (heart failure programme based on telemedicine). Telemedicine management consisted in daily telemonitoring of weight, blood pressure, heart rate and symptoms that were transmitted to a central station controlled by HF nurses. Teleintervention was carried out replacing the physical appointments by videoconference, promoting self-care and performing therapeutic optimization. The determination of direct costs was performed using cost accounting methodology. Primary end-point: non-fatal HF events by requiring hospital attention at 6 months of inclusion (decompensations requiring parenteral treatment). Results: a preliminary analysis of the first 74 patients included was performed. Baseline characteristics: mean age was 77 years 46, 2\% were women, 51.3\% had preserved LVEF, 50\% were in NYHA class III-IV. From 74 patients, 37 were assigned to HFP and 41 to HFP + T. After a follow-up of 6 months, HFP + T group experienced a significant reduction in the primary endpoint and a favorable trends in morbidity and mortality. HF non-fatal event rate, HF readmission rate and mortality rates were 22\%(p:0.007), 14.6\%(p:0.09) and 9.8\% (p:0.39) respectively. In Cox analysis adjusted for covariates, HFP + T group assignment was a risk reduction of the combined endpoint (all-cause death or HF nonfatal events) (HR 0.36 95\% CI [0.17 to 0, 76], P=0.008). Total direct cost of the cohort studied was E 666,829 (8,863 per patient+E 1,423). The average cost per patient was significantly lower in the HFP + T group compared with HFP group (4.350±1.257E vs. 13.625±2.378E; p{\textless}0.001) with a mean difference per patient between the two groups of 9274+E 2,650. Conclusions: Addition of telemedicine to a HF program means: (1) a significant reduction in the number and rate of HF-nonfatal events and also risk reduction of the combined endpoint (all-cause death or HF nonfatal event) with a positive trend in terms of morbidity and mortality. (2) a significant reduction of health costs. The magnitude of the observed reduction suggests their implementation is cost-effective with a quick return in economic terms.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of home telemonitoring (TM) or structured telephone support (STS) strategies versus usual care for adults recently discharged (within 28 days) after a heart failure (HF) exacerbation in England and Wales. METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate three interventions: 1) STS via human to machine (HM) interface; 2) STS via human to human (HH) contact; and 3) TM, against 4) usual care. Given heterogeneity in the interventions, cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using bottom up costing scenarios. Costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 30-year horizon were estimated based on monthly probabilities of death and monthly risks of hospitalisations (HF-related complications or other causes) estimated from clinical effectiveness parameters computed using a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. RESULTS: Base case monthly costs per patient were: £27 for usual care, £119 for STS HM, £179 for STS HH and £175 for TM. TM was the most cost-effective strategy in the scenario using these base case costs. Compared with usual care, TM had an estimated incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £9,552/QALY, whereas STS HH had an ICER of £63,240/QALY against TM. STS HM was dominated by usual care. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) showed 44\% chance of TM being costeffective with STS HH 36\%, STS HM 18\% and usual care 2\%, respectively. Threshold analysis suggested that the monthly cost of TM has to be higher than £390 to have an ICER greater than £20,000/QALY against STS HH. Scenario analyses performed using higher costs of usual care, higher costs of STS HH and lower costs of TM do not substantially change the conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest TM was an optimal strategy in most scenarios, but there is considerable uncertainty in relation to clear descriptions of the interventions and robust estimation of costs.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous studies have provided limited guidance regarding the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of interventions using "telemedicine" models in the management of diabetes mellitus. We conducted a study to determine if routine clinical assessments of diabetes patients could be effectively conducted via computer and telephone interaction with patients and still provide clinical results similar to traditional office care. Subjects and Methods: We enrolled 100 subjects with diabetes in this 12-month, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority study. Subjects were randomized (1:1 ratio) to a control group (CG) or study group (SG). Baseline characteristics were similar. CG subjects participated in quarterly office visits; SG subjects participated in two office visits (months 6 and 12) and two telemedicine interactions (months 3 and 9). Changes in clinical measurements (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], blood pressure, lipids, body mass index [BMI], and body weight) and clinician time requirements were assessed. Results: Seventy subjects completed the study (CG, n=37; SG, n=33). No significant between-group differences in HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids, or BMI were seen at 12 months. SG subjects showed significantly greater reductions in mean (SD) body weight compared with CG subjects: -5.2 (1.6) pounds versus -0.7 (1.5) pounds, respectively (P=0.04). Clinician time requirements for SG subjects were reduced by {\textgreater}40\%. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that use of a telemedicine-based treatment protocol in diabetes patients is feasible and efficient and yields similar clinical outcomes compared with traditional, clinic-based protocols. Telemedicine applications of computer software can potentially expand access to care for patients and may reduce costs for patients, providers, and payers. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

This paper describes the PhysioDirect system used in the trial and how physiotherapists were trained and supported to use the system and deliver the PhysioDirect service. The PhysioDirect system used in the trial was developed in Huntingdon and now serves a population of 350,000 people. When initiating or providing physiotherapy-led telephone assessment and advice services training and support for physiotherapists delivering care in this way is essential. An enhanced skill set is required for telephone assessment and advice particularly in listening and communication skills. In addition to an initial training programme, even experienced physiotherapists benefit from a period of skill consolidation to become proficient and confident in assessing patients and delivering care using the telephone.

	abstract = {Objectives: To compare the costs and costeffectiveness of managing patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) using telemonitoring versus usual care from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS). Design: Within trial post hoc economic evaluation of data from a pragmatic randomised controlled trial using an intention-to-treat approach. Setting: 20 socioeconomically diverse general practices in Lothian, Scotland. Participants: 401 primary care patients aged 29-95 with uncontrolled daytime ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) (=135/85, but {\textless}210/135 mm Hg). Intervention: Participants were centrally randomised to 6 months of a telemonitoring service comprising of self-monitoring of BP transmitted to a secure website for review by the attending nurse/doctor and patient, with optional automated patient decision-support by text/email (n=200) or usual care (n-201). Randomisation was undertaken with minimisation for age, sex, family practice, use of three or more hypertension drugs and self-monitoring history. Main outcome measures: Mean difference in total NHS costs between trial arms and blinded assessment of mean cost per 1 mm Hg systolic BP point reduced. Results: Home telemonitoring of BP costs significantly more than usual care (mean difference per patient £115.32 (95\% CI £83.49 to £146.63; p{\textless}0.001)). Increased costs were due to telemonitoring service costs, patient training and additional general practitioner and nurse consultations. The mean cost of systolic BP reduction was £25.56/mm Hg (95\% CI £16.06 to £46.89) per patient. Conclusions: Over the 6-month trial period, supported telemonitoring was more effective at reducing BP than usual care but also more expensive. If clinical gains are maintained, these additional costs would be very likely to be compensated for by reductions in the cost of future cardiovascular events. Longer-term modelling of costs and outcomes is required to fully examine the costeffectiveness implications.},

Design: Multicentre randomised controlled trial. Setting: 20 primary care practices in south east Scotland. Participants: 401 people aged 29-95 years with uncontrolled blood pressure (mean daytime ambulatory measurement ≥135/85 mm Hg but ≥210/135 mm Hg). Intervention: Self measurement and transmission of blood pressure readings to a secure website for review by the attending nurse or doctor and participant, with optional automated patient decision support by text or email for six months. Main outcome measures: Blinded assessment of mean daytime systolic ambulatory blood pressure six months after randomisation. Results: 200 participants were randomised to the intervention and 201 to usual care; primary outcome data were available for 90\% of participants (182 and 177, respectively). The mean difference in daytime systolic ambulatory blood pressure adjusted for baseline and minimisation factors between intervention and usual care was 4.3 mm Hg (95\% confidence interval 2.0 to 6.5; P=0.0002) and for daytime diastolic ambulatory blood pressure was 2.3 mm Hg (0.9 to 3.6; P=0.001), with higher values in the usual care group.

Conclusions: Supported self monitoring by telemonitoring is an effective method for achieving clinically important reductions in blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension in primary care settings. However, it was associated with increase in use of National Health Service resources. Further research is required to determine if the reduction in blood pressure is maintained in the longer term and if the intervention is cost effective.},

Aim: To determine outcomes of telemonitoring CPAP compliance and efficacy data, compared with standard clinical care and active phone call care. Material and Methods: We performed a randomized controlled clinical study, in which 51 patients (42 males; mean age: 54 years old; mean Apnea/hypopnea index (AIH): 36.8/h) newly diagnosed with OSA were consecutively randomized to either standard clinical care (SC) (n=21), active weekly phone call care (PC) (n=18) or telemonitored clinical care (TC) (n=12) with the use of Restraxx™. All patients were submitted to a comprehensive educational program during APAP adaptation. Patients were followed for their first 4 weeks of treatment with APAP (AutoSetSpirit S8; Resmed™) and data regarding compliance and efficacy was analyzed. Results: Patients randomized to TC used APAP an average of 5.0 ± 1.8 hours per night (hpn), SC patients averaged 5.1 ± 2.5 hpn and PC patients averaged 3.9 ± 2.6 hpn. Residual AIH was 5.3 ± 3.0 in TC, 5.0 ± 2.5 in SC and 5.6 ± 3.8 in PC. No statistically significant differences were found between the groups regarding CPAP compliance or efficacy (p=0.296 and p=0.825, respectively). Conclusions: In the presence of a comprehensive educational program during APAP adaptation, telemonitoring OSA patients didn't show benefits concerning compliance or efficacy. Standard clinical care, given its lower cost, should be privileged.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Widening screening criteria, lowering diagnostic thresholds and underlying demographic changes threaten to overwhelm resource- limited services for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We have developed a mobile phone-based telehealth system (GDm-Health) with the aims of supporting treatment of GDM, reducing clinic visits, improving response time to abnormal BG readings and increasing women's satisfaction with the care they receive. This pilot study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of the GDm-Health system in clinical practice, to assess blood glucose (BG) control and user satisfaction and to inform the design of a randomised controlled trial of the technology. Materials and methods: Pre- and post-meal BG results are transferred wirelessly in real-time from a blood glucose meter to a smartphone app (where they can be annotated by the patient) and then to a server. The data are tabulated and presented on both the server and the smartphone in graphical formats with out-of-target colour codes. Diabetes specialist midwives and doctors review the automatically-prioritised data and recommend dose changes by text messages or phone calls. Women can request a call from their care team to discuss their diabetes, which the diabetes midwife can schedule around her other tasks. The technology has been used by 50 women with GDM from two Oxfordshire hospitals. Results: To date, 41 women have finished using the system, all of whom have had live births. 15,609 BG results have been transmitted. The women tagged 98\% of these readings with annotations indicating whether they were taken before or after a meal. Free text comments from the women about diet and other factors were attached to 16\% of the readings. The clinical care team sent 403 text messages to the women, including 110 medication adjustments. Initial prescriptions of metformin or insulin were given in clinic but dose adjustment to manage the progressively rising glucose levels were also given by phone in response to regular inspection of the automatically-prioritised results. Women made 56 requests for calls from their diabetes midwife, primarily to obtain prescriptions, lancets and strips (39\% of calls) or discuss their diet and medication (18\%). Of 32 women who have returned questionnaires to date, 31 (97\%) agreed that the system was convenient (27 strongly agreed) and 31 women (97\%) agreed that the method of monitoring fitted with their lifestyle (20 strongly agreed). All 32 women reported a good relationship with their diabetes care team. Conclusion: The GDm-Health system allowing remote delivery of care works well in clinical practice and has been positively received by patients and healthcare professionals. A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to establish whether its use can maintain effectiveness while improving quality and efficiency of care, with fewer clinic visits and time and cost savings for both patients and the health service.},

Method:A randomised controlled pilot study was conducted in selected nursing homes in bradford, which were randomised to either the control or evaluation group. All patients with a wound of any aetiology or severity, resident in the selected nursing homes were considered eligible to participate in the study. residents in the control homes who had, or developed, a wound during the study period, continued to receive unsupported care directed by the nursing home staff (defined as 'standard care'), while those in the evaluation homes received standard care supported by input from the remote experts. results: thirty-nine patients with a wound were identified in the 16 participating bradford nursing homes. Analysis of individual patient management pathways suggested that the system provided improved patient outcomes and that it may offer cost savings by improving dressing product selection, decreasing inappropriate onward referral and speeding healing. Despite initial anxiety related to the technology most nursing-home staff found the system of value and many were keen to see the trial continue to form part of routine patient management. conclusion: the current study supports the potential value of telemedicine in wound care and indicates the value that such a system may have to nursing-home staff and patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Recent reviews suggest that telemedicine solutions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may prevent hospital readmissions and emergency room visits and improve health-related quality of life. However, the studies are few and only involve COPD patients who are in a stable phase or in-patients who are ready for discharge. COPD patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation may also benefit from telemedicine solutions. The overall aim is to investigate a telemedicine-based treatment solution for patients with acute exacerbation of COPD at home as compared to conventional hospital treatment measured according to first treatment failure, which is defined as readmission due to COPD within 30 days after discharge.Methods: COPD patients with acute exacerbation who fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were from two university hospitals in Denmark were randomized (1:1) by computer-generated tables that allocated treatments in blocks of four to receive either standard treatment at the hospital or the same standard treatment at home using telemedicine technology (that is, a video conference system with a touch screen and webcam and monitoring equipment (spirometer, thermometer, and pulse oximeter)). Patients treated in the telemedicine group were backed up by an organizational setting securing 24/7/365 online access to the hospital, as well as access to oxygen, nebulizer therapy, oral medical therapy and surveillance of vital parameters from home monitoring devices. Patients in both groups were discharged when clinically stable and when fulfilling five pre-specified discharge criteria. Follow-up was performed at 1, 3 and 6 months after discharge.The primary outcome was treatment failure defined as readmission due to exacerbation in COPD within 30 days. Secondary outcomes were death from any cause, prescription of additional antibiotics or steroids, need of intubation or non-invasive ventilation, emergency room visits, visits to the general practitioner, lung function, bed days, health-related quality of life, healthcare costs and user satisfaction.Results: Enrollment of patients started in June 2010 and ended in December 2011. Follow-up ended in May 2012. Results were analyzed in 2013.Conclusions: The results may have implications on future hospital treatment modalities for patients with severe exacerbations in COPD where telemedicine may be used as an alternative to conventional admission.Trial registration: Clinical Trials NCT01155856. © 2013 Jakobsen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: While treatments and interventions for effective asthma management are well understood, asthma control continues to be suboptimal, resulting in frequent exacerbations, high healthcare utilization and costs, and decreased quality of life. Ambulatory monitoring of inhaled bronchodilators use through sensors and smartphone apps has the potential to improve self-management and provide physicians with a new perspective on disease control. This report summarizes interim results, as measured by frequency of rescue inhaler use, from an ongoing clinical trial. METHODS: Patients at a hospital system in California are enrolled in a randomized, controlled trial, with allocation stratified by insurance type, language (Spanish or English) and level of control. Intervention group participants receive inhaler sensors and feedback through smartphone apps and online interfaces. Intervention patients' physicians receive access to this data, and alerts if a patient falls below control thresholds. Control group patients are outfitted with sensors but do not receive feedback. RESULTS: At 16 weeks, 216 patients (107 intervention, 99 control) had been enrolled (49\% of 440 person target). At enrollment, the mean number of events per week did not differ (p=0.70) between control (3.55 ±5.74) and intervention groups (3.23 ±6.58). In a linear mixed model, over the first 60 days of participation the intervention group used their inhaler 0.14 times fewer per day or 1 event per week (p = 0.046) fewer when compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Remote monitoring of rescue inhaler use provides information valuable to guide and improve self-management and may help physicians identify patients who need more attention. Subsequent analyses will investigate any effects on healthcare utilization.},

	abstract = {Background: Physical training has beneficial effects on exercise capacity, quality of life and mortality in patients after a cardiac event or intervention and is therefore a core component of cardiac rehabilitation. However, cardiac rehabilitation uptake is low and effects tend to decrease after the initial rehabilitation period. Home-based training has the potential to increase cardiac rehabilitation uptake, and was shown to be safe and effective in improving short-term exercise capacity. Long-term effects on physical fitness and activity, however, are disappointing. Therefore, we propose a novel strategy using telemonitoring guidance based on objective training data acquired during exercise at home. In this way, we aim to improve self-management skills like self-efficacy and action planning for independent exercise and, consequently, improve long-term effectiveness with respect to physical fitness and physical activity. In addition, we aim to compare costs of this strategy with centre-based cardiac rehabilitation.Methods/design: This randomized controlled trial compares a 12-week telemonitoring guided home-based training program with a regular, 12-week centre-based training program of equal duration and training intensity in low to moderate risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation after an acute coronary syndrome or cardiac intervention. The home-based group receives three supervised training sessions before they commence training with a heart rate monitor in their home environment. Participants are instructed to train at 70-85\% of their maximal heart rate for 45-60 minutes, twice a week. Patients receive individual coaching by telephone once a week, based on measured heart rate data that are shared through the internet. Primary endpoints are physical fitness and physical activity, assessed at baseline, after 12 weeks and after one year. Physical fitness is expressed as peak oxygen uptake, assessed by symptom limited exercise testing with gas exchange analysis; physical activity is expressed as physical activity energy expenditure, assessed by tri-axial accelerometry and heart rate measurements. Secondary endpoints are training adherence, quality of life, patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness.Discussion: This study will increase insight in long-term effectiveness and costs of home-based cardiac rehabilitation with telemonitoring guidance. This strategy is in line with the trend to shift non-complex healthcare services towards patients' home environments. Trial registration: Dutch Trial Register: NTR3780.

Limited studies are available evaluating the economic impact. The aim of this article is to highlight the social impact and costs for the patients associated with hospital visits for routine device follow-up at the enrollment visit for the TARIFF study (NCT01075516). Methods: TARIFF is a prospective, cohort, observational study designed to compare the costs and impact on quality of life between clinic-based and remote care device follow-up strategies. Results: Two hundred nine patients (85.2 \% males) were enrolled in the study; 153 patients (73.2 \%) were retired, 36 (17.2 \%) were active workers, 18 (8.6 \%) were housewives, and 2 (1.0 \%) were looking for a job. Among active workers, 63.9 \% required time off from work to attend the hospital visit, while 67.0 \% of all patients had to interrupt daily activities. The majority of patients spent half a day or more attending the visit. A carer accompanied 77 \% of patients. Among carers, 36.6 \% required time off from work, and 77.6 \% had to interrupt daily activities. Median distance traveled was 36 km. The average cost of travel was 10 euros with 25 \% of patients spending more than 30 euros. Conclusions: Data from patients enrolled in the TARIFF registry confirm that there are social and economic impacts to patients attending routine device checks in hospital which can be significantly reduced by using a remote monitoring strategy. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of home telemonitoring (TM) or structured telephone support (STS) strategies versus usual care for adults recently discharged (within 28 days) after a heart failure (HF) exacerbation in England and Wales. Methods: A Markov model was used to evaluate a) STS via human to machine (HM) interface, b) STS via human to human (HH) contact, and c) TM, against d) usual care. Given heterogeneity in the interventions, cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using bottom up costing scenarios regarding costs of devices, monitoring and medical care to deal with alerts. Costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 30 year (patient lifetime) horizon were estimated based on monthly probabilities of death and monthly risks of hospitalisations (HF-related complications or other causes) estimated from clinical effectiveness parameters computed using a network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Results: Base case monthly costs per patient were: £27 for usual care, £119 for STS HM, £179 for STS HH and £175 for TM. TM was the most cost-effective strategy in the scenario using these base case costs. Compared with usual care, TM had an estimated incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £9,552/QALY, whereas STS HH had an ICER of £63,240/ QALY against TM. STS HM was dominated by usual care. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) showed 44\% chance of TM being cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY, with STS HH 36\%, STS HM 18\% and usual care 2\%, respectively. Scenario analyses performed using higher costs of usual care higher costs of STS HH and lower costs of TM do not substantially change the conclusions. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest TM was an optimal strategy in most scenarios, but there is considerable uncertainty in relation to clear descriptions of the interventions and robust estimation of costs.},

This study examined the effect of a 9-months remote, telephone-based weight management program for people with physical disabilities using a Web-based system (Personalized Online Weight and Exercise Response System [POWERS]).
DESIGN: A total of 102 participants (mean ± SD age, 46.5 ± 12.7 yrs; body mass index, 32.0 ± 5.8 kg/m(2)) with a physical disability (spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, stroke, or lupus) were randomized to one of three conditions: physical activity only (POWERS), physical activity plus nutrition (POWERS(plus)), and control. The POWERS group received a physical activity tool kit and regular coaching telephone calls. The POWERS(plus) group received an intervention identical to that of the POWERS group plus nutritional information. The control group received the physical activity tool kit and self-guided health promotion resources at the completion of the trial but no coaching.
RESULTS: Postintervention differences in body weight were found between the groups. There was a significant group × time interaction (P {\textless} 0.01) in postintervention body weight, with both the POWERS and POWERS(plus) groups demonstrating greater reduction in body weight compared with the control group (POWERS: -2.1 ± 5.5 kg, -2.4 ± -5.9\%; POWERS(plus): -0.5 ± 5.0 kg, -0.6 ± 4.3\%; control: +2.6 ± 5.3 kg, 3.1 ± 7.4\%).
CONCLUSIONS: A low-cost telephone intervention supported with a Web-based remote coaching tool (POWERS) can be an effective strategy for assisting overweight adults with physical disabilities in maintaining or reducing their body weight.},

	abstract = {With expanding indications for cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) capable of treating bradycardias, complex cardiac tachyarrhythmias and heart failure, the number of patients requiring regular long-term specialized care is growing rapidly. Currently, routine face-to-face follow-up consultations for patients with CIEDs are a significant burden on hospital services. Remote telemonitoring appears to offer a safe and effective alternative to conventional follow-up in this area. The Medtronic CareLink Network enables remote monitoring of CIED patients, and thus has the potential to improve the efficiency of medical care in this population. The objective of the PORTLink (PORTuguese Research on Telemonitoring with CareLink) multicenter randomized trial is to assess the safety, efficacy and costs of remote CIED monitoring compared to traditional face-to-face follow-up. It will evaluate aspects such as physicians' and patients' acceptance of and satisfaction with reviewing device data via the website, the complexity for troubleshooting calls to the support center, the use of emergency resources bysymptomatic patients, the incidence of unscheduled consultations after remote interrogations, levels of anxiety, depression and quality of life, and the main resources used by the CareLink sys-tem. Approximately 200 patients will be randomized in up to five centers, with clinical follow-up of 12 months.

	abstract = {Weight reduction programs are not generally designed or adapted for people with physical disabilities. This study examined the effect of a 9-months remote, telephone-based weight management program for people with physical disabilities using a Web-based system (Personalized Online Weight and Exercise Response System [POWERS]). A total of 102 participants (mean ± SD age, 46.5 ± 12.7 yrs; body mass index, 32.0 ± 5.8 kg/m(2)) with a physical disability (spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, cerebral palsy, stroke, or lupus) were randomized to one of three conditions: physical activity only (POWERS), physical activity plus nutrition (POWERS(plus)), and control. The POWERS group received a physical activity tool kit and regular coaching telephone calls. The POWERS(plus) group received an intervention identical to that of the POWERS group plus nutritional information. The control group received the physical activity tool kit and self-guided health promotion resources at the completion of the trial but no coaching. Postintervention differences in body weight were found between the groups. There was a significant group × time interaction (P {\textless} 0.01) in postintervention body weight, with both the POWERS and POWERS(plus) groups demonstrating greater reduction in body weight compared with the control group (POWERS: -2.1 ± 5.5 kg, -2.4 ± -5.9\%; POWERS(plus): -0.5 ± 5.0 kg, -0.6 ± 4.3\%; control: +2.6 ± 5.3 kg, 3.1 ± 7.4\%). A low-cost telephone intervention supported with a Web-based remote coaching tool (POWERS) can be an effective strategy for assisting overweight adults with physical disabilities in maintaining or reducing their body weight.},

	abstract = {Heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators place a significant burden on health care systems. Remote monitoring allows assessment of device function and heart failure parameters, and may represent a safe, effective, and cost-saving method compared to conventional in-office follow-up. We hypothesized that remote device monitoring represents a cost-effective approach. This paper summarizes the economic evaluation of the Evolution of Management Strategies of Heart Failure Patients With Implantable Defibrillators (EVOLVO) study, a multicenter clinical trial aimed at measuring the benefits of remote monitoring for heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators. Two hundred patients implanted with a wireless transmission-enabled implantable defibrillator were randomized to receive either remote monitoring or the conventional method of in-person evaluations. Patients were followed for 16 months with a protocol of scheduled in-office and remote follow-ups. The economic evaluation of the intervention was conducted from the perspectives of the health care system and the patient. A cost-utility analysis was performed to measure whether the intervention was cost-effective in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Overall, remote monitoring did not show significant annual cost savings for the health care system (€1962.78 versus €2130.01; P=.80). There was a significant reduction of the annual cost for the patients in the remote arm in comparison to the standard arm (€291.36 versus €381.34; P=.01). Cost-utility analysis was performed for 180 patients for whom QALYs were available. The patients in the remote arm gained 0.065 QALYs more than those in the standard arm over 16 months, with a cost savings of €888.10 per patient. Results from the cost-utility analysis of the EVOLVO study show that remote monitoring is a cost-effective and dominant solution. Remote management of heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators appears to be cost-effective compared to the conventional method of in-person evaluations.

	abstract = {Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental health condition with substantial costs to individuals and society. Among military veterans, the lifetime prevalence of PTSD has been estimated to be as high as 20\%. Numerous research studies have demonstrated that short-term cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), lead to substantial and sustained improvements in PTSD symptoms. Despite known benefits, only a minority of clinicians provide these therapies. Transferring this research knowledge into clinical settings remains one of the largest hurdles to improving the health of veterans with PTSD. Attending a workshop alone is insufficient to promote adequate knowledge transfer and sustained skill; however, relatively little research has been conducted to identify effective post-training support strategies. The current study investigates whether clinicians receiving post-workshop support (six-month duration) will deliver CPT with greater fidelity (i.e., psychotherapy adherence and competence) and have improved patient outcomes compared with clinicians receiving no formal post-workshop support. The study conditions are: technology-enhanced group tele-consultation; standard group tele-consultation; and fidelity assessment with no consultation. The primary outcome is independent assessment (via audio-recordings) of the clinicians' adherence and competence in delivering CPT. The secondary outcome is observed changes in patient symptoms during and following treatment as a function of clinician fidelity. Post-consultation interviews with clinicians will help identify facilitators and barriers to psychotherapy skill acquisition. The study results will inform how best to implement and transfer evidence-based psychotherapy (e.g., CPT) to clinical settings to attain comparable outcomes to those observed in research settings. Findings will deepen our understanding of how much and what type of support is needed following a workshop to help clinicians become proficient in delivering a new protocol. Several influences on clinician learning and patient outcomes will be discussed. An evidence-based model of clinical consultation will be developed, with the ultimate goal of informing policy and influencing best practice in clinical consultation.

	abstract = {Objective: Barriers to executing large-scale randomized controlled trials include costs, complexity, and regulatory requirements. We hypothesized that source document verification (SDV) via remote electronic monitoring is feasible. Methods: Five hospitals from two NIH sponsored networks provided remote electronic access to study monitors. We evaluated pre-visit remote SDV compared to traditional on-site SDV using a randomized convenience sample of all study subjects due for a monitoring visit. The number of data values verified and the time to perform remote and onsite SDV was collected. Results: Thirty-two study subjects were randomized to either remote SDV (N=16) or traditional on-site SDV (N=16). Technical capabilities, remote access policies and regulatory requirements varied widely across sites. In the adult network, only 14 of 2965 data values (0.47\%) could not be located remotely. In the traditional on-site SDV arm, 3 of 2608 data values (0.12\%) required coordinator help. In the pediatric network, all 198 data values in the remote SDV arm and all 183 data values in the on-site SDV arm were located. Although not statistically significant there was a consistent trend for more time consumed per data value (minutes +/- SD): Adult 0.50 +/- 0.17 min vs. 0.39 +/- 0.10 min (two-tailed t-test p=0.11); Pediatric 0.99 +/- 1.07 min vs. 0.56 +/- 0.61 min (p=0.37) and time per case report form: Adult: 4.60 +/- 1.42 min vs. 3.60 +/- 0.96 min (p=0.10); Pediatric: 11.64 +/- 7.54 min vs. 6.07 +/- 3.18 min (p=0.10) using remote SDV. Conclusions: Because each site had different policies, requirements, and technologies, a common approach to assimilating monitors into the access management system could not be implemented. Despite substantial technology differences, more than 99\% of data values were successfully monitored remotely. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of remote monitoring and the need to develop consistent access policies for remote study monitoring. Copyright © 2013 Mealer et al.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of telehealth on 1) the diagnosis, and management in obstetrics and cardiology, 2) health care costs from patients' perspectives, 3) attendance at health centres located in remote areas of Mali.
METHODS: The impact of telehealth on health care utilization, quality, and costs was assessed using a five-point Likert-scale based questionnaire consisting of three dimensions. It was completed by health care professionals in four district hospitals. The role of telehealth on attendance at health centres was also assessed based on data collected from the consultations logs before and during the project, between project sites and control sites. Referrals specific to the activities of the research study were also evaluated using a questionnaire to measure the real share of telehealth tools in increasing attendance at project sites. Finally, the cost savings achieved was estimated using the transport and lodging costs incurred if patients were to travel to the capital city for the same tests or care.
RESULTS: The telehealth activities contributed to improving medical diagnoses in cardiology and obstetrics (92.6\%) and the patients' management system on site (96.2\%). The attendance records at health centres increased from 8 to 35\% at all project sites during the study period. Patients from project sites saved an average of 12380 XOF (CFA Francs) or 25 USD (American dollar) and a maximum of 35000 XOF or 70 USD compared to patients from neighbouring sites, who must go to the capital city to receive the same care.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that in Mali, enhanced training in ultrasound / electrocardiography and the introduction of telehealth have improved the health system in remote areas and resulted in high levels of appropriate diagnosis and patient management in the areas of obstetrics and cardiology. Telehealth can also significantly reduce the cost to the patient.},

	abstract = {CONCLUSIONS: Remote X-ray consultation through Aycan OsiriX PRO and iPad should be considered as a means for reducing the need of in-hospital orthopaedic consultation during on-call times, and potentially decrease the cost of care for the health system. In the future, alternative systems less expensive than Aycan OsiriX PRO should be further developed and tested.
BACKGROUND: The growing cost of health care and lack of specialised staff have set e-Health high on the European political agenda. In a prospective study we evaluated the effect of providing images for remote consultation through an iPad on the number of in-hospital orthopaedic consultations for children with bone fractures.
METHODS: Children from 0 to 18 years diagnosed with a bone fracture by the radiologist during the hours when an orthopaedic service is provided only on-call were eligible for enrollment. Cases were enrolled prospectively during September and October 2013. A standard approach (verbal information only, no X-Ray provided remotely) was compared to an experimental approach (standard approach plus the provision of X-ray for remote consultation through an iPad). The primary outcome was the number of orthopaedic in-hospital consultations that occurred. Other outcomes included: immediate activation of other services; time needed for decision-making; technical difficulties; quality of images and diagnostic confidence (on a likert scale of 1 to 10).
RESULTS: Forty-two children were enrolled in the study. Number of in-hospital consultancies dropped from 32/42 (76.1\%) when no X-ray was provided to 16/42 (38\%) when the X-rays was provided (p {\textless} 0.001). With remote X-ray consultation in 14/42 (33.3\%) cases services such as surgery and plaster room could be immediately activated, compared to no service activated without teleradiology (p {\textless} 0.001). Average time for decision making was 23.4 ± 21.8 minutes with remote X-ray consultation, compared to 56.2 ± 16.1 when the X-ray was not provided (p {\textless} 0.001). The comparison between images on the iPad and on the standard system for X- Ray visualisation resulted in a non statistically significant difference in the quality of images (average score 9.89 ± 0.37 vs 9.91 ± 0.30; p = 0.79), and in non statistically significant difference in diagnostic confidence (average score 9.91 ± 0.32 vs 9.92 ± 0.31; p = 0.88).},

	abstract = {Introduction Home mechanical ventilation (HMV) in the Netherlands is normally initiated in hospital, but this is expensive and often a burden for the patient. In this randomised controlled study we investigated whether initiation of HMV at home in patients with chronic respiratory failure is non-inferior to an in hospital based setting. Methods Seventy-seven patients were included, of which 38 patients started HMV at home. All patients were diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure due to a neuromuscular or thoracic cage disease. Primary outcome was the arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) while quality of life and costs were secondary outcomes. Telemonitoring was used in the home group to provide therapeutic information, for example; transcutaneous carbon dioxide, oxygen saturation and ventilator information, to the caregivers. Follow-up was six months. Results PaCO2, improved by 0.72 (SE ± 0.16) kPa in the hospital group and by 0.91 (±0.20) in the home group, both improvements being significant and the latter clearly not inferior. There were also significant improvements in quality of life in both groups, again not being inferior with home treatment. Conclusion This study is the first to show that initiation of HMV at home in a selective group of patients with chronic respiratory failure is as effective for gas exchange and quality of life as hospital initiation. In addition we found that it is safe, technically feasible and that more than € 3000 per patient can be saved compared to our standard care.},
